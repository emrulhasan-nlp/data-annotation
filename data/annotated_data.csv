jetsetter741,2322662,"W Paris is in a very central location in the heart of town, a short walk from Galleries Lafayette and Printemps, and with a stunning view of the Opera. The hotel is filled with very chic women in fur coats and staggeringly high heels, so if you like people watching, this is a great place to park yourself (we saw Nikki Hilton in the hotel bar). We booked the standard (wonderful) room, and found the room a decent size for a hotel in Paris, and it came with all the modern amenities as expected, iphone chargers etc. There is also some seriously good chocolate in the mini bar. The breakfast is pricey (45 euro) and wasn't included in our standard room rate, but worth experiencing at least once - the service was great, and they had hot soup, the freshest croissants ever, as well as eggs done in many styles (I had the poached egg with salmon and it arrived topped with fish roe - super yummy). The hotel restaurant has an excellent chef at the helm, and served really good tapas. Worth trying at least once - and DO book ahead, because it was closed for a private event the first night that we were there, and FULL the next night. The hotel bathrooms are glass, and not nearly frosted enough if you are traveling with a business associate! Be warned also that there are no places to hang towels inside the shower area without getting them wet. All in, the hotel is WOW, for location and cool factor. Worth checking out in Paris!

Shocking hotel given the price they charge. Nice property but service is shocking (especially house-keeping). Avoid the hotel. I took my wife here to celebrate her birthday. The location and building were superb but sadly that's where we stopped being impressed. The hotel had been open for three days and already looked dated, the staff were still in the process of being trained so whilst all were very friendly service was very slow. The room had a very comfortable bed but the accommodation was cramped with a very strange bathroom set up that had a tiny toilet and no bath. The door to the room allied all external sounds through and we were woken by work still being done to the hotel at 5am. We also heard all the music from the bar until late into the night- not what you'd expect from 5 star hotel. We returned from a day out in Paris to find the room hadn't been made up. Personally I thought very poor value for the money. I was last week with my wife at the w hotel in Paris. We had an excellent experience. I would like to highlight some aspects. First of all, the service. Every one is concerned about you have a great stay. Second, the room is very comfortable but the bed is superb. And the third, aspect, the restaurant. ArolaÂ´s proposal is excellent. Whit any doubt I will back.",,,
travel_agent_Queb,615880,"We asked for 2 rooms, one beside the other the day I made my reservation over the phone, Jessica is the Reservation employee, she said ""OK"" , then when we arrived they gave us a room on floor 7 and the other on floor 3, when we went to the room and opened it, it was OCCUPIED!!!!! Yes, there were guests' in the room, they didn't see us because I think that they weren't inside, when I went to tell Jessica what had happend she said, ""Oh, sorry""....we asked to talk to the manager and we never saw him in the three days we were there. I do not recommend it at all. Poor service. This hotel, in the City Center, next to Santa Rosa Mall is great. It's small, comfy and like home. It has only a few rooms, but WOW. I only stayed for one night, but I found it better than what I thought it would be. Very Clean, very friendly staff. And the mall is at walking distance. I give it a 10!","It was very difficult to find the hotel. We drove around for 1 1/2 hours and called the hotel 8 times. The hotel's staff could not provide the proper directions. The staff was very inefficient. This hotel was very disappointing. We rented 2 rooms and did not have any hot water. We also found roaches in the restrooms. The room safes did not work in both rooms. The hotel did not have a map to the airport either. This was our worse hotel experience ever. This hotel, in the City Center, next to Santa Rosa Mall is great. It's small, comfy and like home. It has only a few rooms, but WOW. I only stayed for one night, but I found it better than what I thought it would be. Very Clean, very friendly staff. And the mall is at walking distance. I give it a 10! We stayed there for a couple of nights. It was our first visit to San Jose and were going on to Rincon. The hotel staff was very helpful, the rooms were very clean. It's about 10 minutes by car from Old San Juan and it wasn't a problem to commute. We saved about $90 per night versus staying in the tourist area of San Juan. There isn't much night life around there, but we knew that ahead of time. We would definitely use this hotel again. The hotel staff was friendley and helpful. The hotel was clean and neat. We stayed 5 days and 6 nights. We rented a car and were gone all day visiting family and shopping. When we returned to the hotel at night, the parking was convinient and safe, underground, with plenty of parking spaces. We ate dinner with our extended family at the Hotel Restaurant. The food was tipical puertorican cuisine, fresh, delicious and reasonable priced. Thank you Luis Otero for accomodating our large group at the restaurant and for your excellent service. We recommend this hotel to all travelers, business and families. I would recommend the San Miguel Plaza Hotel to anyone who is visiting Puerto Rico and need to stay in the Bayamon area. It's the perfect quiet hotel with an excellent restaurant right in the hotel so you don't need to go any where for the best food and people, as well as music. I returned to Puerto Rico after 20 years to see my father and I was a little concerned with booking a hotel in that area, but San Miguel Plaza Hotel makes you feel very comfortable and it's very clean and the staff are so wonderful you will not want to leave. They gave us special treatment and are so helpful with giving you directions to any where in San Juan. I plan to return soon.",,,
luv2travel16,1022068,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at the grand peninsula hotel. We chose this hotel because of its location. The hotel is central to most of the top istanbul sights: 10 minute walk to blue mosque and hagia sophia. There are plenty of restaurants right down the street. We also found their shuttle service to and from airport very convenient, cost was 20 euros each way to ataturk airport. The hotel serves breakfast on the roof with a nice view. Having breakfast every morning was a great way to start the day before exploring the city. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They also have free wi fi, which was a nice bonus. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a clean, centrally located and affordable hotel in Istanbul. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport. I was a little worried at first because the cab driver did not know where this hotel was located. When we finally arrived at the hotel, we were impressed at the size of our room...well its not just a room, it is actually an apartment with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, 2 baths. We were able to get a good night sleep before our flight and take advantage of complimentary breakfast. I would have rated the baran 4 stars but i was disappointed at the service more like lack of service. There is usually no one at the front desk and we had to figure out on our own how to take a cab to the airport. Fortunaly there is a cab stand right down the street. This hotel is a good option for large groups because of the space and if you want to be near the airport. I would not recommend if you want to be close to Istambul's main attractions.","This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. It is in a nice quiet area of the city, not many cars drive past your window and there are no clubs nearby to disturb your sleep. The staff are friendly and the reception staff speak english. I like this hotel as it's also a self contained flat with microwave and hob etc. I can't comment on the breakfast served here as usually cook myself or goto one of the many resturants in the city. The apartment is very big and has 3 bedrooms so good for big groups or just one person. They have satilite tv with about 400 channels (it took me a while channel hoping lol) but i only saw about 3 channels in english the rest turkish or arabic but you dont go on holiday to watch tv. Trams, buses and taxis are only a short walk away along with some resturants and a small shopping centre. I always enjoy my stay here and will be going back again.

What an excellent addition to Istanbul's accommodation scene your apartments represent. We enjoyed our week there, and the apartment is in a great location and well appointed. I was only supposed to stay here for a night, which was disappointing, because I wanted to stay longer. So far, this is the best hotel I've stayed at so far in Turkey. Because of it's prime location in the city, I expected it to be good and my wish was granted. Flats were impressively decorated. They were pretty, classy and very excellent looking. The bedroom was a pleasure to sleep in, and also had a view of the city. They were spacious and comfortable",,,

The hotel is very cosy, quiet, soft elegant. It is a perfect location if you want enjoy Paris in a relaxing way. Shopping in the Saint Sulpice atelier, walking down Saint Germain, visiting luxemburg exhibitions. The odda hotel is really a very nice place with its old charming atmosphere, good stilish furniture, well equipped rooms and, first of all, a quite efficient service. However is located in one of the most noisy place in Istanbul, just in the heart of an area full of music pubs screaming till late in the night. Sleeping becomes an hard think to do even if the rooms are equipped with very good soundproofed windows. It is a pity","As most other reviewers of this hotel, I really liked the place. Some complain that it's noisy but when you choose an hotel located at Istanbul's equivalent of NYC's Times Square area, who's to blame? The hotel or the person who actually decided to rent there??? In this city of 14 million people, the hotel is located right in the heart of the city's nightlife area, everywhere in the city is much calmer. The hotel staff is friendly, the rooms are bright and clean, internet is free, fast and always on, the hotel is safe (left money, my laptop, a tablet, a camera and a phone in the room and no one ever touched it in the 5 days I stayed there). I almost only have good things to say and will definitely go back to this hotel at the time of my next visit. Everything was perfect except the following: - Breakfast is the same every morning (waitress is very nice) - A friend of mine called 4 times and talked in Turkish with the front desk staff, he left messages for me each time to the employees but nobody ever transmitted his messages to me nor notified me of a message. - Although there is absolutely no dust in the room of in the bathroom, accumulated dirt on the white ceramic floor of the bathroom made the tiles go dark gray all along the walls. It would need to be scrubed thoroughly. - Single room is 110 Euro directly with them and $110 USD on Expedia but if you buy from Expedia you get room on noisier first floor.... They keep the higher floors for people who pay more, even when the hotel is not even half full. Well insulated so not bad anyway. The odda hotel is really a very nice place with its old charming atmosphere, good stilish furniture, well equipped rooms and, first of all, a quite efficient service. However is located in one of the most noisy place in Istanbul, just in the heart of an area full of music pubs screaming till late in the night. Sleeping becomes an hard think to do even if the rooms are equipped with very good soundproofed windows. It is a pity We would reccomend this hotel to everyone, because it is located in the middle of Istiklal street, it is very clean, the personnel is very friendly, polite and helpful. The rooms are very pleasant and comfortable. We were 3 friends from THESSALONIKI. ODDA hotel is well located one block from Istiklal street. It is well-furnished and clean with friendly staff. However, the hotel is by no means a four-star establishment: no pool or gym, basic cafe, no room service, minimal bathroom items. I booked a king-size bed, but the receptionist told they only have twins. Which was okay for a single person, but I don't imagine two people arranging themselves on a bed so small. Noise from nearby discos is very strong in the room until about 4am. So not much chance to get asleep before that, and I never managed to wake up for breakfast, which is until 10am. I stayed for five nights while visiting Istanbul for an academic conference. As a solo female traveler, I was extremely happy with this lovely hotel and its friendly staff. My room was very clean and comfortable (and I am really picky and finicky about clean hotel rooms) and the location, in terms of getting around, was fantastic. The only problem for me, was the noise coming from the clubs and the bars on the street below. If you are coming to Istanbul to party, I am guessing this location will be perfect for you- you can stay out late and sleep in! I had to be at the university every morning and the noise definitely kept me up. That being said, the value was great and I have no regrets about staying here! I recommend it whole heartedly! We stayed 3 nights. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the room however the photos give the impression of spaciousness. There were no standard rooms left when we booked so we had to take a deluxe. While the bathroom was large the room itself was tiny - I hate to think how small the standard rooms are. Having said that our stay was very comfortable. The bed was lovely especially after a hard day's shopping and the air conditioning/heating was appreciated. Breakfast was OK too but the filter coffee had run out on the first morning and not replenished. This hotel is well positioned for bars, cafes and shopping. I stayed 4 days at the ODDA Hotel. The stay was really nice and so are the staff, in the end I was almost sorry to leave. Upon arriving I found myself in a valley of smiles from the very first person I met Emre. First thing I asked him who did the design of this hotel, because if you are an engineer or architect you would have noticed the taste. I loved the perfect interior design and perfect decoration. Later on he introduced me to the staff and they explained everything I had available. Entering the room, it was clean and perfectly designed. The bathroom is also spacious and very clean. The bed was one thing that if I could take her home, I would have done. Hard in the right places and comfortable.... Very rich and tasty breakfast, I love scrambled eggs, and I found the best around. . With each breakfast I became more spoiled and I was late for one of my meetings because of this perfect breakfast :) Well I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want to leave :) As far as location, you are on the right trackÃ¢â¬Â¦ 5 minutes to famous Istiklal Street. Everything is there, everywhere is there. Well I saved lots of money because of being at the location which is close to everywhere so I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t need any cab, but of course I spent that money on drinks :) There are a lot of things that made me enjoy my stay at this hotel, but my warmest congratulations to the Hotel for their choice of personnel. They know how to really make you feel at home, and if you need anything it is like asking a family member. Congratulations from the heart, you were fantastic. Baris A. All in all a nicely desined hotel (if you don't look at the horrible pictures in the breakfast room, might have been put there by a taste free management and can not have been intention of the architect) with small rooms in a lively area. the downsize of the stay was that the hotel staff gave our suitecases from the storage room to an italian tourist group. we where lucky that the italian tourists brought the luggage back hours later, but this was totally unneccessary stress and should not happen. although the staff was nice and helpfull, but this should not happen in a well organized hotel. The Good: - New hotel - Simple and elegant decor - Very clean washrooms and rooms - Excellent hotel management and staff...wonderful people - Fabulous location (close to shops, restaurants and cafes) The Not So Good: -Breakfast was very simple with options of cheese, boiled eggs, bread and olives - The hotel should invest in an egg station to cook fresh eggs - any style The Bad: - The noise level...was...REALLY...bad at night. We did not sleep well as the noise continued until early into the morning. The hotel staff tried to help but it's really out of their hands as the hotel is in a nightlife/clubbing district. Great hotel but because of the noise level I would not stay here again. The hotel is located just a few steps away from Istiklal road in Taksim -- which is a great location for restaurants, nightlife, strolling around, and access to Metro and Tram. The hotel is brand new with great interior design. The service was really accommodating as well. It gets loud at night, as it is near many bars and clubs. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.",,,
3tonkies,109351,"The Sofitel was nice. It was a little dated. I always pick hotels with room service 24/7, not knowing how I'll feel when I arrive. Sofitel offers a limited menu after midnight, and we did not choose to order anything. They have a small bakery in the lobby that had delicious croissants and other pastries that are made in-house. The shuttle service to and from MIA was reliable and friendly and even provided water for the very short trip. The employees were very friendly and helpful. This is a very good choice if you need to be close to the airport. Beautiful hotel. We stayed in the Mediterranean Suite and it was perfect for me and my teenage daughter. As an interior designer, I can say the interior was amazingly refreshing from what I'm used to seeing in other hotels. Basically, if you book at a Kimpton Hotel, you can't go wrong. Get the fish in your room, it's their signature perk, and if traveling with kids or teens, it's a must. Also, don't forget you can travel with your own pet at Kimpton Hotels, and they welcome Fido. Literally, with a welcome sign in the lobby and a bowl, etc. Great customer service whether you have two legs or four. This hotel is a great choice if you're shopping NorthPark. It's pretty centrally located, and you can get anywhere in Dallas easily. The staff is always friendly. While I'm not a fan of the new Courtyard cafe concept, the food is decent. I sure miss the breakfast buffet for quick, healthy breakfasts. You can't beat the Courtyard for cleanliness and value. As an interior designer, I give the Hotel Palomar 5 Stars for an incredible job turning an old Hilton Hotel into a gorgeous, contemporary haven. I can't wait to go back. The hotel is relatively close to Love Field, and North Park Mall. After I was finished with work, I checked out and had them drop me off at North Park (no charge hotel car), checked my bags at the North Park courtesy desk and shopped to my heart's content, then took a quick cab to Love Field. Worked out great. The restaurant, Central 214 was delicious. My favorite was the Key Lime Pie, and warm peach cobbler. Entrees were great too. Kimpton Hotels allow pets, and what a treat to be able to take a pet and not have to stay in a dive. They welcome your pet with a sign in the lobby....too cute. Full service, even for pooch. Next time I plan on trying the spa. My trip was too short to fully experience all the amenities the hotel has to offer, but suffice it to say, I will definitely be back. Since Coconut Grove is the hangout for UM students, we decided to stay in the Grove so my daughter could get the full UM experience. We stayed in a 2BR suite with bay view. The layout was great for our family and the view fantastic. Two kingsize beds, and a comfortable sleeper sofa in the living room. 2 full baths and a powder room. Having a full kitchen is great, especially because the refrigerator has an icemaker. There is a CVS close by that has a nice selection of snacks and beverages to stock the kitchen. We got room service every morning for breakfast, and a couple of times for dinner. The menu and service are from the hotel's Panorama Restaurant one of the best restaurants in the Grove, and will not disappoint. We had sashimi, steak, etc. Everything was great. For breakfast, pancakes, eggs benedict, etc. All delicious and served piping hot. My only issue with room service was that frequently they didn't bring the right number of ""set ups"" so we were short silverware and napkins, but thankfully there is extra silverware in the kitchen. On our last night, I called the front desk very late and asked about the possibility of a massage. No problem, within the hour, not one, but two massage therapists arrived to give our massages. I was surprised to get such great service at the last minute. My only complaint was with the bathroom. Hot water was not really hot, and as I understood it from maintenance, it's something they are working to correct. My husband attempted to use the jacuzzi and it apparently hadn't been used in some time and spewed some residue. On this particular day, housekeeping had not come, and as it approached 5 we were concerned that we were going to be skipped and have to deal with the tub ourselves, but the front desk made sure we were taken care of. I wish we could've gotten later check out, but that's a problem with all hotels. They were very accommodating and allowed us to leave our bags and car parked with valet so we could walk around CG before heading to the airport. I would highly recommend the Sonesta for any stay in the CG area, especially if you are visiting UM. Great view, great food, and a charming community. We stayed here for a couple of days before moving on to Bodrum for a ""blue cruise"". The rooms are very nice..upscale Marriott style. The outside dining area is stunning, and the breakfast fare amazing. I can't say about the other meals or room service. Concierge, doorman, all exceptional. After staying in a Residence Inn the night before in Syracuse NY, I found this location lacking. I travel with pets and have no issue with non-refundable pet fees in order to be able to stay in a nice, clean, room. This room was gross. The hallway outside smelled of dog pee. My dogs were all over the room sniffing at the carpet, and found something interesting, dried dog poop droplets, embedded in the carpet. They weren't large, but still....nasty Then I found dog poop behind the bedroom door. Socks under the bed, lipstick on the glasses, all in all an experience I don't want to relive. i notified the evening desk clerk about my dissatisfaction, she apologized. In retrospect, I wish I would've asked for another room, but having driven 12 hours I was a little brain dead and just wanted to go to sleep. I told her I didn't mind the dog fee, but expected a clean room. I also complained at check out, and she expressed concern, stating she would speak with the manager and to expect that my pet fee would be refunded. I appreciate that greatly, but would have been happier paying the $100 and getting a room that wasn't nasty. I called the manager this morning, and she was very responsive. She had already refunded my $100, and had spoken with the contractor they use to sanitize the room., so while my experience wasn't good, I will say that the manager's response was terrific. She appreciated the comments and said that they become a better hotel by guests letting them know when they fall short. That's the right answer! For that reason alone I will check the ""recommend"" box.","Comfortable bed, spacious room, quiet nights - and afternoons. That's a good start for a review, but I want to complement the housekeeping staff for how efficient they are. Even with late arrival, front desk check in was speedy and smooth. Internet functioned well. Did not use hotel dining options, but the coffee smelled great! If the hotel is full, finding a parking space may be difficult, but we managed okay for three days. Location is easy to navigate. Too cold for the pool. Hot tub looked in good condition, but we did not use. Room furniture is very functional with a small sofa and a desk. The desk has an additional pull-out table that makes for versatility in working or eating. Nice. Our room had a coffeemaker but no frig or microwave, which was no problem for this stay. Coffeemaker is the single cup style with pods (not K-cups.) I often bring my own coffee, but in this case I could not use it. I would be happy to stay there again. This hotel is a great choice if you're shopping NorthPark. It's pretty centrally located, and you can get anywhere in Dallas easily. The staff is always friendly. While I'm not a fan of the new Courtyard cafe concept, the food is decent. I sure miss the breakfast buffet for quick, healthy breakfasts. You can't beat the Courtyard for cleanliness and value. This is a hotel for business travel, shares parking lot with a Residence Inn. I wouldn't recommend it for a family with children.We had difficulty reaching the hotel directly (don't like the Marriott web site) when we were trying to determine the correct exit off Central Expressway. Having lived in Dallas, we managed but Central Expressway traffic isn't for the faint of heart. Breakfast is limited, but convenient. Much better service for our drinks at 6. No restaurants within walking distance. Overall, I suspect the next door La Quinta is probably exactly the same with cheaper prices and a free breakfast. As a frequent Marriott traveler, I can attest that this location is superb. We had a quality night's sleep and enjoyed the amenities, great location near the highway, the front desk staff were top notch. If your expectations are properly set, this is great property to stay at. It is conveniently located - only about 10 minutes north of downtown Dallas and equidistant to North Dallas suburbs. They showcawse the new Courtyard motif...new restaurant/lounge, new styling throughout...a much better experience than the old. I am more than likley to to return as it is comfortable, offers easy acess to North Central Expressway, and its location for is suitable for where I conduct meetings. It might also contain the best pool setting of any Courtyard I have seen and a decent fitness center so family travelers and those who an enjoy a workout might find this property appealing as well. Marriot interior is so good. it gym, Spa n all fine. break fast and lunch menu's really wonderful. Staff's are good. they are ready to help the people. Good customer service. High speed internet connection with unlimited download. that is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stayed here for 2 nights for sports tournament downtown. They did give us an excellent room rate which included a continental breakfast. The odd thing was the continental breakfast was in a meeting room with no service, not the hotel restaurant, and was pretty basic. Most of us elected to eat a hot breakfast in the dining room for $2 extra. It would have been far better if they had just charged more for the room and let everyone eat in the restaurant. Hotel is older but rooms are nice. Beds were queen size but mattresses were on the hard/firm side. Rooms were very quiet and no hall/door shutting noises. We were on the side away from the highway.",,,
chicagotoots,530673,"Great location, friendly service, beautiful indoor heated pool, rooms clean, comfortable, breakfast LQ standard, pet friendly and decent price. Because we travel with our pet, we have attained elite status which gives us bottled water and snack. They don't tell you it is only ONE bottle of water and ONE snack per room. So if you are an elite member, count on sharing a bottle of water. Stayed there on a promotional rate of 79/night but they added the ""resort fees"" which still brought the price up to around $100 per night. Room was clean, view was so-so (part building, part rollercoaster), bed comfy, tv worked, swimming pool was small and shaded in the morning and we didn't use it. The restaurants were not cheap (LV Strip prices) and the ""coupon book"" at checkin was for two free drinks, one newspaper where you had to go somewhere to get (we never did find it... the hotel/casino is huge), and 20% off on shops. Since we had just come from a 14 day tour of China and were very tired, we slept a lot and the rooms were very quiet. Won't do a hotel in Vegas with ""resort fees"" tacked on ... think the next LV trip we will stay around Fremont Street which is more the ""old Las Vegas"". This part of the strip was too hard to get around with sidewalks, pedestrian overpasses, and construction. The 24 hour bus pass for $7 was a good deal to get to/front Fremont Street and the stop was across the street from NY, NY. Chose this LQ over another after reading the reviews. This one was just fine - suite using points and $30 up grade charge, room was clean, ""guest ready"", very helpful evening desk clerk, quiet. Breakfast was an upgrade from the usual LQ - included warm biscuits and gravy and bacon, fruit, yogart, waffels, etc. Good location off the expressway, right near a Sonic drive in, pet friendly, nice outdoor swimming pool and hot tub. Definitely a good choice. One block from beach, easy walking distance to the San Juan Casino, Intercontinental Hotel Casino, many fast food restaurants, and bus line to get to/from Old San Juan. Rooms and swimming pool clean, hot tub temperature was variable - some days too cool to be called a ""hot"" tub, another day it was too hot, shortage of pool towels for hous on a hot Saturday afternoon. Restaurant and bar in hotel, prices reasonable, food good. The service of the front desk staff was the best!! From the front desk reception to the checkout, the hotel is Hilton. The room was quiet and soooo comfortable especially the pillows. Restaurants downstairs and Kitty O'Sheas pub for music and beverages. Only downside was we were bothered by housekeeping when they forgot a piece of paper in the room (looked like their report sheet for cleaning) there was no coffee in the room, got interrupted when the man came to check the mini bar and the housekeeper knocked on our door at 9a to clean. Come on... do we have to keep the ""privacy please"" sign on the door at all times? Stayed there on a promotional rate of 79/night but they added the ""resort fees"" which still brought the price up to around $100 per night. Room was clean, view was so-so (part building, part rollercoaster), bed comfy, tv worked, swimming pool was small and shaded in the morning and we didn't use it. The restaurants were not cheap (LV Strip prices) and the ""coupon book"" at checkin was for two free drinks, one newspaper where you had to go somewhere to get (we never did find it... the hotel/casino is huge), and 20% off on shops. Since we had just come from a 14 day tour of China and were very tired, we slept a lot and the rooms were very quiet. Won't do a hotel in Vegas with ""resort fees"" tacked on ... think the next LV trip we will stay around Fremont Street which is more the ""old Las Vegas"". This part of the strip was too hard to get around with sidewalks, pedestrian overpasses, and construction. The 24 hour bus pass for $7 was a good deal to get to/front Fremont Street and the stop was across the street from NY, NY.","I have noticed some mixed reviews of this property. 2 weeks ago, we stayed at this hotel and reserved a room at the AAA rate which was less than $60.00. Our room came with a King sized bed, coffee maker, microwave, and mini-fridge. The La Quinta was also close to several nice eateries and some local shopping. I cant speak for anyone else but....our room was clean and fairly modern looking. The gentleman at the front desk did a fantastic job with hospitality. We did not utilize it, but there was also an indoor pool. For the services and value that we recieved for the price, I would recommend this to travelers who want a decent room and value for their money. I too..would stay here again. Good luck with your travels. Checking person is very friendly. The hallways were bright and attractive. The room was large, clean, wirh wll designed furniture, clean carpet and a super comfortable bed. There were plenty of spare outlets for ipods, laptops and cell phone charging. The bathroom was also quite nice. The elevators were always fast. Overall, nice place to stay. Got in late, 1st room had pubic hair and bed bugs in the sheets when first pulled back. Tried another room, even more bed bugs. Went to better/clean hotel in middle of the night. NASTY!!! Great location, friendly service, beautiful indoor heated pool, rooms clean, comfortable, breakfast LQ standard, pet friendly and decent price. Because we travel with our pet, we have attained elite status which gives us bottled water and snack. They don't tell you it is only ONE bottle of water and ONE snack per room. So if you are an elite member, count on sharing a bottle of water. We were in Indianapolis for our conference. We absolutely loved this place. Staff was very friendly. Enjoyed pool. All kinds of restaurent is around this hotel. Value was very good as well. Difinitely will stay here again.",,,

Friendly and helpful service, good breakfast. This hotel just screams for a makeover like double glazed windows, modern bathrooms, good beds and interior decoration for the bedrooms. Other than that very good value! I did stay at La Reserve a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend, and we had a wonderful time over there. The room that we stayed in was very quiet and clean, apart from that the location was very good very close to centre of London and sights seeing. However If you dont expect a modern hotel probably you will have a great time over there like us. On arrival glass on main entrance was flithy and once checked in discovered our room to be smelly with tatty bed linen, one electricial socket to be working and a broken window. we were then moved to a bigger room but with similiar standards again one plug socket working no spoon to stir tea, cups were flithy and the general look was shabby,Breakfast consisted of stale crossiants and the whole look of the hotel is very very run down, In need of a MAJOR refurb...so we will not be returning. Stinks, Dirty, grubby, smelly, unfriendly, unprofessional, rude. Never again!!!! . The welcoming clean foyer of this hotel belies the appalling state of the rooms. The walls and doors along the corridors are grubby and desperate need of painting . The rooms themselves were not very clean and the beds were atrocious, I have never known a lumpier more uncomfortable bed and the alleged 'spacious bathrooms' as per their leaflet are tiny. There were long dark hairs clogging up the plug hole. Three redeeming features are 1. It's close to Fulham Broadway station ( District Line) 2. I was given a complimentary basket of surprisingly fresh fruit in the room. 3. Breakfast was above standard with plenty of choice and the staff allowed us to check in early and look after our luggage after we had checked out. However, I shall not be returning to this hotel. You get what you pay for. Fine hotel. Close to the underground where it is possible to run directly to Westminster (Big Ben, London Eye. Etc) The hotel has a prime location for Stamford Bridge (50m), 200m to the underground and a few 100 meters up to one of the most expensive streets in London (King's Road) where many celebrities come and open the windows of their new Ferrari, Porsche or a second car that bmw, audi and land rover. The area around the hotel, many restaurants, cafes, shops etc.. The staff is very sweet. They offered me to book a taxi to the airport if I had not mastered it. Breakfast is not fantastic. But dinner is fine. The hotel is not a 5 star, but if you just have to sleep there and walk in shower is perfectly fine. Hotel is situated next door to Chelsea Football club and we arrived at 2pm on a match day so the area was extremely busy as you would imagine! There were security staff on the front door of the hotel but we didn't see them again, so presumably that is just a match day precaution. Check-in was easy but I remember thinking the lounge looked shoddy, there was a stained settee in reception on our arrival, but that had gone some time later so probably was there awaiting removal. Our room was situated on the ground floor, just through from reception. It was small, and the furnishings were very shoddy and in need of up-grading. Rather disappointing compared to the web-site pictures. Beds were comfortable though and breakfast was nice, with a menu that would satisfy most people - continental and full English was available along with a vegetarian option. ( Vegetarian burger, not sausage - different!! ) We were going to Earl's Court and the hotel was close to Fulham Broadway tube station so was very convenient for travel. Our stay was for a weekend. Staff were pleasant enough and the hotel itself was adequate. I would stay there again, but would ensure I had looked at other choices in the vicinity first! They are rampant. Please don't stay here. They refuse to rectify the problem and the beds are so full of bugs, we had over 100 bites. And there is then the risk of bringing them home. The manager is fully aware of the issue but refuses to rid of the mattresses. Please pass this along! In the past 10 years I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The first time then hotel was a pleasant 3 star with friendly staff, satellite TV and ok decor. The second time the staff was less friendly, no more sat tv and a reduced breakfast quality, but the redeeming feature was the free parking and it was generally an ok place. Then I stayed there again last month - mainly because I needed the parking space - and it was BAD. We arrived on a day with a power cut and the staff saw us as an inconvenience and was generally quite unfriendly and could barely understand English. Our room wasn't hoovered due to the powercut and when asking if this would be done as soon as the power is back, we were told 'no tomorrow'. The room wasn't actually too bad and had been cleaned. The room ws small-ish with very worn furniture, but the linen was clean and the matrass looked ok to the eye too. The curtains and bed spread should have been washed a long time ago though. The TV was hardly watchable due to very bad reception. The bathroom tiles were cracked but all appeared cleaned. The first morning the breakfast was ok and rolls & croissants seemed fresh. The sencod morning the rolls & croissants tasted to be from the previous week. When checking out I complained as they were charging full price for an unhoovered room and the bad breakfast but the receptionist was very rude and made it sound as if it had been our fault. i woulnd't have minded all the negatives so much if the price had been beetter - we pais Â£85 per night for the room and the service and standart did absolutely not match the price. Stayed here in July and my wife got bitten all over by bed bugs. These rooms are NOT CLEAN. I found a couple of them and the linen full of blood. Friggin' things wouldn't even die when I popped them! So disgusting I was checking every bed in every hotel afterwards. Then the manager/owner tried to imply that we might have brought them! This was the first leg of our trip and we had just stepped off of business class...I don't think so. Wanted to wring his neck...but he didn't actually come out and say it. The breakfast was crap. Standard cereal and bread but everything a bit stale. I will not be returning to this hotel. We paid Â£89.00 per twin room which i would value at about Â£40. The car park is small with no bays so we had to park where we could and leave the keys for all 4 of our vehicles behind reception in case they needed to be moved. The beds were uncomfortable with springs sticking into you while sleeping, the pillows were lumpy and the linen didn't look the freshest. The showers have been set at Umpa Lumpa height so you bang your head on them and the room decor really needs attention. My worst complaint would be the staff when they could be found. They were very abrubt and rude,due to this we ate and drank elsewhere which resulted in them losing around Â£300 as thats what we spent in another venue. The breakfast was of continental style but you had to ask for toast and walk around the restaurant to look for sugar. my friend booked this hotel for 4 of us, after reading the reviews i was not looking forward to it,but i was pleasantly surprised,yes i agree the hotel is very dated and in need of decorating but the room was clean. the continental breakfast was excellent and the staff i spoke too very pleasant. Stayed at La Reserve last week end,had already booked when I looked on 'Tripadvisor' I read all the bad reviews,but thought I would take the chance, as most other hotels were booked out. Big mistake, we checked in on the Thursday evening, after a very slow check in,the key to my room could not be found,so the porter had to use the master key to let me into my room,the room was clean enough,but had a very strong smell of cigars, I closed the curtains but they would did not cover the window, as the room was at the front of hotel it was very noisy.plus at ground level people could see in. I went to meet my colleagues, and while I was sitting in the reception/TV area I sat counting all the ants that were coming and going in and out of the floor boards. Breakfast was a very dull afair, I went to make tea and the water was cold from the machine.The staff looked fed up and were in no way helpful. Who I thought was the manager never spoke or was in anyway pleasant. All in all it was a terrible place to stay. Never again! next time I will check Tripadvisor before I book. Do not book this hotel. It looks okay on the website but it's a different story inside. We booked it for a 5 night stay and on arrival the room we were given was an absolute disgrace, the door didn't close properly, the bathroom was filthy, the ""double bed"" was two twins pushed together which didnn't stay in place. When we complained we had to wait until the next day to be moved to a slightly cleaner bigger room, but not much of an improvement. The food was not good at all and the staff were very unhelpful.",,,
zensurfergirl,197576,"My fiance and I just returned from a long weekend in Paris. This was our first visit and we could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Hotel Galileo.

Very good location , nice stuff , clean & simple rooms , free internet would be there again I stayed one night while I was on a day trip from London. Brilliant location walking distance to everywhere I wanted to go. Cute litte room that was very clean. The front desk help was super nice and helpful. Would recommend this place to anyone! I stayed one night in this hotel during a business trip. I can fully confirm the tripadvisor average score. Location is really good, just a few steps away from the champs elisees, in a very up-scale neighborhood. The price I got was pretty decent, considering Paris and the location. The room was surprisingly large for Parisian standards, plenty of towels (good quality) in the bathroom and a good stock of bathroom amenities. The bed was confortable and heating was ok (not to hot, not too cold). The room was quiet. I also appreciated the (American style) coffee maker with coffee and tea. I did not try the breakfast because it was too expensive (it's much better to go to a street cafÃ¨ on the Champs Elisees). This is a good, solid hotel with really good price/quality ratio. I recommend it. I stumbled on Hotel Galileo through Trip Advisor and have to say I was extremely happy with my stay. At the time I was struggling to get around with a back injury so the location was absolutely sensational. The sightseeing tour bus stop was on the Champs ElysÃ©es at the end of the street and the metro station was very close also. The room was very clean and nice and quiet (so much so I slept in one morning)! What sets this hotel apart from many I stayed in during my trip was the staff. They were extremely knowledgable and were able to answer pretty much any question I asked - or knew who to ask for the answer, they booked tickets to the shows I wanted to see and also helped me out where possible knowing I had an injury to work with. Hotel Galileo staff were all round some of the best staff I have experienced in all my travels. Great job and I look forward to seeing you again in 2012 or 2013 - whenever I make the trip from Australia again! Hotel Galileo is a small hotel located close to the Champs ElysÃÂ©es. We were very pleased with our one night stay. The price/quality ratio is very good for Paris standards. Our room was located at the side of the street, but there was no bothering noise. The room was clean, not too small and there was a nice bathroom. We would certainly go back there. My daughter and I stayed here for 4 days in august , and had a wonderful stay. The management was friendly and helpful, our room was spotless and the breakfast was included in our room rate, and it was the perfect start to our days, eggs fresh coffee and of course croissant ! The bathroom was a nice size and our windows opened for fresh air, although the room was air conditioned the weather was not hot so we enjoyed the open air. The hotel is located just 2 blocks back from the Champs, and the side street was quite and nice, and the restaurants the staff recommended were all good. All in all i would go back and stay here again, and have recommended it to my friends. This was our first time visiting Paris and we were not sure what to expect or where to stay. Spent several days looking at Trip advisor and came across this Hotel, close to the Champs-Elysses and l'arc de triomphe it proved to be a fantastic location. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, giving advice on where to eat and how to get there. The Hotel itself is quite small but that added to the charm. Our room was more than adaquate, clean with all the amenities you would expect, including free wi-fi. All in all this hotel added to our fantastic stay in Paris. Would definately stay there again and would recommend to all. Lovely hotel near l'arc de triomphe. Very clean with helpful receptionist. The rooms are a bit small but very comfortable with a tv, mini bar and safe. George V metro is only about 100mts far. My mother and I stayed there for a week and loved it! The breakfast was so convenient and the staff there, attentive. With free Internet, air conditioning, a safe and a mini bar, the room contained all the essentials. My only disappointment was in it's size...it was a little small which meant having to be super organized with our things. However, we managed and would definitely return. Good position, friendly personal, right price. Position near arc de triomphe",,,
KUrquie,1451746,"I can't compliment this place enough. The customer service was excellent - the best I've ever experienced. The staff really couldn't do enough for you or help out more. The accommodation was very spacious, very clean, turndown service was a fab bonus - no complaints about the accomodation. The 'mini bar' was awesome and free - you asked reception for whatever you wanted from a huge range of snacks and soft drinks, and within minutes you had it - completely free of charge. Free popsicles by the pool was another added bonus. The location was perfect - less than five minutes walk from Chinese Theatre etc. Cost-wise, The Magic Castle Hotel was one of the least expensive that I found. The Magic Caslte Club next door was an amazing evening as well. Not being particularly 'in to' magic, I was in absolute awe of the magicians - both those that performed as part of a show and those that performed off the cuff. All in all an amazing experience. I would absolutely stay at the Magic Castle Hotel again and would 100% recommend others to stay there too. I marked the sleep quality 'average' as the pull out sofa bed wasn't the comfiest but not enough to cause a problem The room was was dirty - my feet were filthy after coming out the shower and walking on the carpet, the blinds above the bed were thick with dust, the cooker didn't work - although I wouldn't have used it even if it did, there was no safe and we were on the ground floor facing onto the main street and the lock didn't feel very secure, there was no air conditioning so we asked for a fan. We did get one, but we were told only to have one electrical appliance in use at a time which we found laughable, the staff weren't particularly helpful or interested in us and didn't appear to know the local area (we asked for some advice on tourist attractions but other than give me a leaflet and a map, the staff were no help). I was completely unimpressed with this place - it was right on the beach, but even the beach wasn't that nice - there are much nicer beaches in San Diego. All in all, I loved San Diego. We were only there for a few nights but had a fab time despite our nasty sleeping conditions. My recommendation would be stay elsewhere folks. I can't compliment this place enough.

We were only there for a few nights but had a fab time despite our nasty sleeping conditions. My recommendation would be stay elsewhere folks. We stayed here February 2012. This motel is nothing fancy but the location is perfect, right on the beach. Our room had a partial view of the ocean. The view of the ocean from the balcony outside our door was amazing! The room was clean, very basic, with a small refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker. They gave us extra coffee, towels, etc. when we requested them. The bed was comfortable. The motel is within walking distance of many restaurants, many of them right on the beach. There is a coffee bar about a block away at Crystal Pier. However, parking is definately a problem. There are not enough parking spaces and the parking on the street fills up fast, especially on the weekend. We would definately stay here again. It is probably the most affordable place to stay on the beach. Stayed here for 2 nights on a girl's USA roadtrip and can honestly say this is one of the worst places I have ever stayed. We stayed in a one bedroom 'suite' which was on the ground floor right next to the reception. The room was pretty large to be fair however it was in a word FILTHY! The whole place smelled mouldy and the dust was about an inch thick on the window blinds. The wardrobes in the bedroom were also very smelly and mouldy needless to say we never bothered to unpack. The outdoor area was rather untidy and the tables and chairs were old and dirty. We asked reception to borrow an iron and the one they gave us was covered in burnt in black stuff so we ended up chosing to wear our clothed creased rather than use it. When we returned the iron the lady had the cheek to look at the burnt stuff then at us in disgust!!!! The only thing going for this place is the location which is right on the beach but when you see the other hotels and guesthouses surrounding the Pacific View Motel then it just magnifies exactly how bad this place is. NEVER again! If you are looking for a place right on the beach, this is it. We were so impressed with this hotel. They even provide you with a parking space...at the beach. The employees were all friendly and attentive. This is definitely the last of its kind on the beach. PLEASE don't ever let them tear it down. Granted our room was small and sparse but who cares? We heard the ocean all night and we just had to walk out the front door to the beach. The sheets and towels are clean and there was plenty of room for us to keep our bikes in our room with us. There are a lot of great but inexpensive restaurants all around you and we felt totally comfortable everywhere we went. We will never stay anywhere else when we go to San Diego again.",,,
Geoark1946,225114,This is a sprawling place but it is beginning to show its age. The room was clean but worn the AC/Heat was very noisy and the towels really needed to be replaced. Again we had a pricing issue we had a reservation conformation for one price and the clerk that checked us in would not honor it AT ALL. When we checked out a real manager was on duty and did adjust the room rate to match what the confirmation showed. This was not a disappointment at all the room was clean the shower worked well the AC worked the TV was good and the location could not be better. Easy to get to and about half way down 76. This was one of our stops on a weeks journey nad it was welcome. The room was quite and clean the water was hot what else can you ask.,"I'm not a person that needs to invest a large portion of my vacation money in accomodations. I need a clean room with a good bed, decent breakfast and I am happy. This is exactly what we got. No extras, no frills. If this is what you are looking for then I recommend this hotel. I traveled to Branson for a one night stay to pick-up family at the airport. Stayed at the Red Roof Inn the first time by myself and was looking for a bargain price. I was surprised to find the room was very clean and the staff were great to do business with. I've been back for several more visits. My daughter and I will continue to use the Red Roof Inn in Branson. Price was great, beds were soft, room was clean, and staff very friendly. It's affordable , clean , there's a pool not that far off the strip over all good! First time we have stayed at Red Roof Inn. I cannot say it is a 5 star motel but it was very clean and the staff acted in a professional way. I don't know why others only give this motel a 2 or 3 star. Folks this is not the Marriott. Don't expect steak when you are paying for bologna. my stay at the red roof inn in branson was ok.. my bed was hard as a rock and my room kinda smelled funny but other than that the stay was good.. had a good clean facility, kind room service, nice front desk and the pool was clean the first night we got there then there was some people that partied there and they put trash in the pool had the pool a total mess.. they also had a nice warm breakfast to eat!!! The heater in the room didn't work, we had to be moved to another room. I never heard an apology. The TV remote didn't work. The hotel phone didn't work properly. The lobby breakfast was a joke; cereal and donuts. Carpet on the room floor felt NASTY. Will NOT stay in a Red Roof again. staff was pleasant and helpful. the rooms had actual keys not cards and opening the room was somewhat trickey. the room was clean and the inn was quiet. we like red roof inn because the accept pets w/o extra charge. the ice machine by room was broken but at least it had directions to a working one. continental breakfast had your typical cereal, fruit, donuts plus waffles. This was one of our stops on a weeks journey nad it was welcome. The room was quite and clean the water was hot what else can you ask. My family & I stayed here one night and while the front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant, the carpet in our room caused my wife's feet to turn BLACK within just an hour or so of walking on it (see picture of socks from earlier review - EXACTLY like her results!!) Great location and free wifi was nice, but just very hard to overcome cleanliness issue like that.... I don't no where to start, checked in everything ok, went to the room and the door was open(should of been my first clue) when I opened the door the whole room was trashed, I'm talking about trash all over the room beds weren't made, it looked like there had just been a party there.We were moved to another room that wasn't much better, the beds were made and that was it, trash in the cans no towels or soap no supplies!!!!!! Then they were gonna move us to the3rd room, at that point enough was enough. We stayed in the 2nd room after they brought us supplies. The next morning we couldn't check out fast enough!!!!! The kicker was they allow animals there and when my grandson woke up he had flea bites all over his legs!!!!!! Flea bitten motel!!!!!!!!!!!!! This particular Red Roof Inn needs a few improvements.1) they need to either rehang or replace their drapes and traverse rods,the ones in our room didn't hang or close right,I needed to take a hair clip to hold them together and there were big gaps at the top so light still came in.2) they need to replace their tvs.We've stayed at this particular property before and had the same problem with the picture not coming in clear and the volume was hard to adjust,also,we didn't get half the channels they advertise because they said there was a problem with the satellite provider.3) we had chunks of black stuff blowing out of the heater,I read another review that said the same thing. The location of this particular Red Roof is great,off the beaten path,but it needs some improvements and basic maintenance.",,,
LondonUKPhil,294913,"Having stayed in Istanbul in 5* hotels I was quite shocked to find myself in what some travel sites have gradwed 2*. On pulling up I thought at first that the taxi driver was stopping for directions, not realising the hotel was next to us. It is situated on a main street and an alleyway. Inside I was not reassured by a small lobby, tired and uninspiring. On being shown to my room I was likewise less than unimpressed by tired furniture, poor wallcoverings and a bathroom that showed signs of poor workmanship. To find my double aspect room had windows overlooking the main road with lots of trams and traffic whilst the second aspect opened directly behind the outside bar, and I really mean the windows opened onto the area behind the bar, I could reach out my hand and get a beer if I wanted one, you could imagine how I felt having spent the last 18 hours travelling. However the restaurant/brakfast room was lovely, even though the breakfast was less than inspiringly presented. The quality of the breakfast was fine. The hotel staff were all excellent, working hard to make you welcome and feel your custom was valued, with no eye to tips etc. The location is fabulous for all of the main attractions of Istanbul (Sultanahmet area) meaning a stay of 3-4 days is all that is required. I found my initial concerns about the hotel fading away as the days passed and realised that actually it was clean, comfortable and run by people who wanted to make your stay a happy one. As my wife was joining me after 2 nights I moved out to a previous reservation paying twice the rate that I had been paying in the BW Sophia. The hotel, whilst lovely, was within 300 metres and had a smaller room. I hope this is not considered too negative a review because in all honesty if I was told I was staying there again on business I would be quite content. I chose this hotel to move to from another after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. All were accurate. I was disappointed by the size of the room, having paid ÃÂ£220 per night, but had I read the reviews in detail I would have seen that this was remarked upon by others. The hotel service though is superb. From the initial greeting and information to the free evening meal on our first night the staff worked tirelessly to make our stay a happy one. Always eager to help with free use of their internet and booking advance tickets to avoid the many queues at the main attractions you will have to look hard to find a group of people who try to help more, without being intrusive. The location is idea,l being central to the main historic attractions of old Istanbul (Topkapi, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar and Bosphorus Cruises). I have visited Istanbul on 4 previous occasions and stayed in the 5* Grand Hyatt in the Taksim area. I saw more in 3 days staying at the Konak than I have seen in all my previous visits. I can recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay there again.","Arrived in Attaturk airport where there was supposed to be a pick up driver for us but none appeared. After some time I phoned the hotel and they promised to pay on arrival. However our airport taxi driver couln't find the hotel for an hour at least. When we arrived we were the told the hotel was overbooked and at about 23.30 hours we were shipped off to anothe rhotel where the the traffic noise kept us awake for most of the night. At least four other guests had been sent off like ourselves. We got no compensation or apologies for the ruination of our first night. The next morning we returned but we we place at the fornt of hotel where traffic noise and nearby music was a constant irritant for the next few days. I booked on the basis of reviews I read here at Trip Advisor and I ask that this review shold be placed towards the beginning. Rooms are a bit stuffy, but overall fine. Good location right by the tourist sights. The staff are friendly, but one staff member was a bit 'too friendly' and inappropriately kissed us on the cheeks when putting our suitcases in the room, and touched me every time he walked past, making me feel rather uncomfortable. Having stayed in Istanbul in 5* hotels I was quite shocked to find myself in what some travel sites have gradwed 2*. On pulling up I thought at first that the taxi driver was stopping for directions, not realising the hotel was next to us. It is situated on a main street and an alleyway. Inside I was not reassured by a small lobby, tired and uninspiring. On being shown to my room I was likewise less than unimpressed by tired furniture, poor wallcoverings and a bathroom that showed signs of poor workmanship.

Fantastic location, next to Hagia Sophia--we could see the Blue Mosque from our room. Breakfast had lots of fresh vegetables, yogurt, pastry, cold cuts, etc. and a man who will make you a splendid omlet! Room was of good size, with an excellent bathroom. Although our room was on the main street, with the tramway running outside, it was generally very quiet -- venue across the street plays Turkish music, but this stops @ 10 pm. The terrace pub on the first floor of the hotel is a wonderful place to have a drink and people watch. The staff at the hotel was most helpful and made our 12-day stay a time to remember. We would definitely stay here again. Place had a good location, very very standard,, no luxury at all. same breakfast for the 4 days we were there. courteous staff, very warm, helpful Manager. If you book directly u can get some good discounts. This is the season .. go for it.. and stay here.. u can walk to most of the places, tram close by, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia all nearby. We loved the hustle and bustle of the street-not bad..so go for it. We stayed at the hotel in November 2010. The location is really greate! We stayed at suites with St.Sophia view. The hotel arranged free transfer for us from Ataturk airport. The suites was big enough. But the hotel needs repair! For breakfsat they serve oamlet, tomatoes, cheese, cofee..The tram station is 10min walk from the hotel. The exachange office is right round the coner. i loved best western saint sophia!!!so did all my family:) its one of the best hotels i ever stayed in my whole life we stayed there 1st week of april....it was amazing...the staff are very helpful,and breakfast was good.and what a location!!saint sophia museum is litrellay across the street ,facing blue mosque, topkapi palace 3 min away and near many good restaurants! my parents are going back to istanbul in 6 month and definitly staying in saint sophia! i recommend anyone to stay there:) special thanks to ms. Tula I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. It is small hotel with friedly staff. Very Cosy and Lovely Hotel! I was in Istanbul first time and for 4 days. Staff was extremely helpful, whenever I called for anything. the staff was very professional. Best location, in the centre of city. Most of sightseeing you can reach by walk. Room we had was fairly small, but comfortable for the time we spent in it (nights only) Location of the hotel is fantastic. VERY close to all major sights. However, above all we appreciated the hotel's staff. They were VERY helpful and friendly. This takes in all counter staff on duty while we were there, the outside restaurant manager (Serkan) , and the people tending the breakfast room.Really exceptional, above average! Talking about breakfast, this too was excellent. Picked hotel by location and it was great. We could walk to all important sights in Sultahnamet , and Galata Bridge was only 20 minutes walking. People at hotel very nice although staff would benefit from some additional english . Breakfast in morning very nice and good selection. Room was comfortable but needed some maintenance on ceiling . Air conditioning not functioning one day but they got it repaired. The 5 am wake up call and the tramway have some impact on sleep..good earplugs essential. You need look no further than BW Saint Sophia Hotel to experience the best of Turkish hospitality. As a frequent traveler to Turkey, I have stayed at a number of hotels. However, after two separate stays in May and June 2010, I know that this hotel will be my ""home"" whenever I am in Istanbul from now on. Our room over the main thoroughfare was spacious and perfect for us. Looking out from the balcony and seeing the Blue Mosque up the street and hearing the frequent call to prayer IS Istanbul for us. The very efficient air conditioner kept us cool and easily blocked out the traffic noise when needed. The bathroom was large and had the hottest water and greatest water pressure that I have ever found in Turkey. The cleaning staff was friendly and always diligent about their work. In fact, every single staff person was outstanding and a real asset to the hotel. All their names escape me, but I remember Fatih was often helping us at the front desk. Airport pickup is a real plus after a long flight. Due to our second stay, I was delievered back to the airport at 3 a.m. for an early, early flight to Amsterdam. How wonderful not to have to worry about such details! Breakfast is something to look forward to because of the great choices--even omelets! Free bottled water was left each day. Hotel manager Tula Bayatis was definitely a major factor in our positive stay. I appreciated her e-mails and the time she took to respond to our questions prior to our arrival. While we were there we had several visits. Tula went out of her way to ensure that our stay was perfect and she succeeded! This hotel is one of the best i've stayed in. Staff, location were great. Free internet and breakfast was a plus. I stayed at the Best Western St. Sophia for one night while my parents were here, and the manager bent over backwards to make that affordable for me. My only warning to people who have not been to Turkey before is that all hotels in Sultanahmet and any other areas near mosques are going to have some noise issues-the call to prayer can be an abrupt early-morning wake-up call if you're not used to it. We booked via Best Western for a 5 night stay. We were given a very pleasant corner room on the 2nd floor with a view of Saint Sophia on one side and the main road facing the Blue Mosque on the other, which despite a few other reviews saying it was noisy really isn't the case. OK It was fairy cold, so we could close the windows at night, but we didn't have any problems. The staff were very helpful and not at all pushy when we asked for advice. They booked tickets for a performance of the Whirling Dervish without fuss and with no extra charges or commission. We had a small problem with the shower which they made a quick fix the same day, and completely sorted out by the next. The location is just fantastic, you can get to the major sites in minutes, and there are tram stops a few hundred yards up or down the road, so getting to Taksim or the ferry ports for trips further afield is pretty straightforward. They have a small friendly bar attached to the hotel and you can order food from the reasonably priced restaurant just across from the hotel.",,,
michelw88,156560,"We chose this hotel for its promotional price and it was in Kowloon. The hotel was a little further from the main street than I had expected: it's about a 15-minute walk to Nathan Road and the shopping area, while I had thought to be there in less than 5. We took the hotel shuttle (counter B12) from the airport, that was a great decision: it was very convenient, dropped us off right at the hotel, and I doubt we would have found it if we would have searched for it ourselves. The hotel room is small as pointed out by others (but average sized if I compare it to other hotel rooms I have seen in HK), I can imagine that would be a problem for overweighted people, but for us it was fine. The room has lots of mirrors, making it feel bigger. The bathroom door was from glass, so if I hadn't been travelling as a couple, I would have considered that very inconvenient. The staff was helpful and friendly, the hotel was modern and clean. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here! We stayed at this hotel for five nights. We had opted for a 'superior room' with a harbour view, and that was a great decision: the view was lovely! We could see over the water all the way from former Kai Tak Airport to Tsim Sha Tsui. Both during the day and at night it gave spectacular views. Breakfast at the hotel is overpriced, it is a better choice to go to one of the restaurants surrounding it. We really liked that there were two computers at the reception with free internet. The location is a bit further out from the main tourist areas, but the subway is less than a block away. Also I did like North Point for its restaurants: more authentic Asian food than in the Central area, and very cheap. So it was nice to come back to North Point at night and enjoy a nice dinner before going back to the hotel room. The only thing we didn't like about it, was the check-in: we were told the room would be ready in 30 minutes when we arrived, in the end it took almost 1.5 hours to check-in. If we had known that before, we would have dropped off our luggage and done some sightseeing first. We stayed at this apartment in September for a total duration of three nights. In general we liked the place, but it had a few downsides as well. Pros: - Location: only 6 blocks from the train that takes you to YVR airport. It is centrally located, with downtown Vancouver, grocery stores (Safeway and Whole Foods), restaurants, internet cafÃ©s, Stanley Park, bicycle rental places etc. all located within walking distance - Spacious apartment. - Beautiful view of the city and the mountains. We had asked for a room with a view to the north on a higher floor, and got one, which gave beautiful views both at day and at night. The balcony is a nice extra. - The price: it was the cheapest hotel in the downtown area, plus because it has a kitchen, we saved even more money by not having to eat out every night, as Vancouver is an expensive city. - Despite being in downtown Vancouver, it was quiet in the apartment. Cons: - The hotel seemed like it had been renovated a few years ago (maybe for the Olympics?), and since then not much has been done for maintenance. For example the âHotelâ-sign only had âHoâ lit up at night, there were stains in the curtains, the kitchen was not very clean (we had to do dishes before we were able to use them, as there was still dirt from previous users on them), the elevator did not respond to âdoor closeâ, etc. Nothing was in an unacceptable condition, also we didnât see any bugs, but I wonder whether the hotel would get the 3.5 star rating as it has been rated by if it would be rated nowadays. - The hotel room was pretty cold. When we asked the receptionist, we got a space heater, but that only helped a little. In general we had a pleasant stay at the hotel, and some of the comments here on Tripadvisor we could not relate to at all: for example the windows did have shades (7th floor) even during the day it was pretty dark in the room. The staff was friendly and helpful, the bed was comfortable, we got warm water in the shower instantly etc.","I didn't have a wonderful time here, but there was nothing wrong with the room. It was clean and fairly quiet; it had a nice kitchenette. My wife and I checked in at the Riviera on Thursday, October 20 and had planed to stay for two nights. After we saw the awful state of the suite, we asked for a refund, but were denied. I went to the front desk, armed with my camera, and explained that I would put photos of the suite on the internet, we were given a refund without a problem. There was mold on the ceiling in the hall, in the bedroom, in the bathroom, and the living room. The windows had no screens. Wallpaper in the living room was curling up above the heater, which was falling apart. An electrical cord above the heater was stapled three times to the wall. The chesterfield appeared very old. The carpet was old, dirty and worn; it curled up at several places in the suite. The suite was a mess, totally disgusting. We checked out and moved to another, much better hotel for a little extra money. We stayed at this apartment in September for a total duration of three nights.

I took my chances inspite of the lower rating because I've stayed in this area before and I was extremely happy with my decision. First of all the reception staff were all fantastic and friendy. They really get out of your way to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms were always cleaned. They may be slightly dated as written in previous reviews but they serve their purpose..comfortable and functional especially with the complete kitchen. Location? Read all the reviews!! They are all correct. For $ 99 a day, I hit the jackpot. Thank you Riviera and the front desk staff. Where do we start? Run down building outside and inside. Smells, hide a bed with thin mattress so sleeping on springs. Cigarette burns all over blankets. Electical tape around the hair dryer. Lamps that had shorts in them. Shower water that took 15 minutes to get warm. No mat for shower that was slopped. No screens on the windows 8 stories up. Laundry facility still had wet towels and comforter inside 2 washers left by housekeeping. Dirty dirty! Smelled so bad near the entry of the parking garage. All through the night heard traffic outside. Scary squeak in the elevator which takes forever! They need to just tear the building down and start over!!!!!! We checked out the next am as soon asap. They didn't blink a eye or charge us when we said we were leaving. Must be used to one night stays!!!!! This is a good value budget hotel, clean, excellent location, full kitchen, and mostly helpful staff. Ther is a Italian cafe close by that's serves good pasta.",,,
Melissa D,2156160,"My best friend and I stayed here in May of 2011. The location is great, just minutes walk to Hyde Park which is amazing! Also right around the corner is Lancaster Gate Station, and a bus stop which will take you anywhere in the city that you want to go. Reception is just right across the street, and you have to drop off your key anytime you leave your room, but everyone at reception is very nice and helpful. Yes the rooms are small, and the bathroom is tiny, but that is to be expected. The rooms are comfortable enough for sleeping and showering. When you are in an amazing city like London with so much to see and do, you really only need a place to sleep and shower. That is what is great about The Paddington. It is no frills, but for the price and location it is perfect. They also include breakfast downstairs every morning. Nothing fancy but you get as much as you want. This place is great for travlers on a budget. The area is also very nice and quiet and we felt very safe. Even for two younger women alone in London we felt safe taking a walk at night. Service provided by staff of this hotel is the best I have experienced in the US to-date. Every staff member I encountered was pleasant, friendly, and helpful. The level of service provided by Omni is hard to find in the US hotel market today. Little touches, like the wake up calls provided by actual people rather than automated voice, rectifying the issue I had with my laundry not coming back in the state I would have expected them, and the staff going above and beyond was very much appreciated. The view was lovely, location was convenient to the convention center, and to a variety of local bars and restaurants was very much appreciated. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in San Diego traveling on business or attending a convention. At first glance this place seems to have it all; good location, modern furnishings and decor....but so did Hitler's bunker. Apart from anything else; you can not eat, drink or move your chairs closer while you're by the pool...in fact sitting down and shutting up to admire the concreted hillside opposite is all that the poolside offers. (except for the latest 'Now that's what I call appalling' music playlist.) The food which requires no preparation (coffee, cheese) is ok because all they have to do is spend money on it but anything that requires the slightest bit of human contact is left severely wanting (croissants left under a desk lamp don't taste good no matter how expensive the butter is). Basically DO NOT be fooled by the L' as it belies no Parisien charm or Bordeaux beauty whatsoever. In fact the only thing slightly French about the place is the rudeness of the staff. All in all, find a good park bench with a starbux next door, and you (and the entire family) will have a better holiday experience than at this badly run, inhuman, boring, unfriendly ""hotel"". Its as if there is native unrest just outside the gates and this joke of a hotel only houses the staff that don't have the sense to run for the hills. Stay away...for God's sake, stay away!!!!!!! Sura Hotel is something seen out of a magical fairytale. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with huge white marble stallions surrounding you all the way down to the concierge. Warm smiles and welcoming staff are ready and eager to serve you with whatever you desire... The rooms are so clean and tastefully decorated! The restaurant downstairs served the most delicious food along with exquisite service! My overall stay there was such a pleasure, I can't wait to go back!!!!! Great location, specially if your first time in NY. The hotel is near by Brodway theaters and shops, Moma and Rockfeller center. Service is excellent. Staff is extremelly friendly and helpful. Rooms are ok, they call this hotel ""boutique"", but it's not, furniture is worn. Rooms are very small, but it didn't bother us at all. Shower is great and bathroom is spacious. Sleep quality is great: comfy pillows and bed, dark windows. I ordered breakfast once and it was very good, except for the ""hot chocolate"". There was no chocolate in it.

The Hotel is Superb in designs and service is excellent. Very nice location. Highly recommended. VERY nice hotel located in good area . You can reach easily by foot the most famous historical and touristics places. VERY good Service and very good food. Sura Hotel &Suits located in Sultanahmet district has a very easy communication. I think this point is very important for people who travel abroad. when i check in the hotel i was surprise of its special desiged ,especially the precious stones on every floor. One thing that also impress me a lot is the food. I tasted its cuisine myself and it woved me : )Ã¯ï¿½Å Stayed in many other hotels before, but I do think frankly Sura is one of the best hotels that we can find in this special touristic district. This hotel has a splendid decoration and layout, and the room makes people conformtatble! and the location is good, the transportation is convinient! the foods is delicious and have multi choice! if i have chance to go istanbul again, i will still live in here! it is very nice hotel,very nice roon,and nice color matching,it will be the first choose for my vaction.i like it Perfect location! The Blue Mosque, the Topkapi Palace and Aya Sophia are right outside. The Metro is very close, too. You can just step outside the door and can enjoy old Istanbul, but at the same time, the hotel is quiet. The hotel itself is beautiful and was kept clean and is maintained meticulously. Not one trace of dirt on the many mirrors or glass surfaces. The hotel offers organic milk for breakfast and the restaurant serves organic meat. Service was friendly and helpful. Note that the larger rooms are depicted in the photos. The cheapest rooms are rather small. Internet was at times slow but the hotel is new and I hope that will still be fixed.

The restaurant downstairs served the most delicious food along with exquisite service! My overall stay there was such a pleasure, I can't wait to go back!!!!! I stayed with Sura Hotel as part of a tour package with True Blue Tours. The hotel is still new and service is good but many (if not most) of the staffs speak limited English. Also, remember to pack your toothbrush as this hotel does not provide one. But what makes this hotel really stands out is its location. It's very close to all the local shops, restaurants, cafes as well as all the major historical sites in the Sultanahment area. I definitely recommend trying this hotel if you're planning to stay in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul Best service , large rooom , very comfortable , good food , everything here is so perfect ! Invited by friend in Turkey and stay for 1 week. Cool places near hotel to feel the Byzantine! Clean, great service in front desk. Also, this hotel has the best restaurant in Istanbul. I really enjoyed the food. Recommend to all the travelers who's planning to visit Istanbul! Sura design hotel is a sweet, upscale boutique hotel in the best location to see all of Istanbul's amazing attractions. My room was lavishly decorated, with a balcony looking out at the Blue Mosque. What a site at night! The staff was so eager to please that I felt like a queen and the front desk people--Hassan and Neil--couldn't have been more helpful. They suggested restaurants, called for a taxi, and went out of their way to help when I needed it. An historic hammam is connected to it as is a restaurant and cafe. It is in walking distance to Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc. Right in the middle of everything with great restaurants all around. It has just officially opened and the roof terrace hadn't opened when I was there but it will have a fabulous view when it does. In crowded Sultanahment, the hotel even has a garden and cafe exposed to the outdoors. It's design is high end (with a touch of over-the-top), stylish and creative. We were a group of 28 running the Istanbul marathon and staying there for 4 days. The hotel is brand new, pretty luxurious but a little bit ostentatious. Still some things are missing, no curtains in some rooms ... But the real issue is the service, if you need nothing you can ask the reception unless you will be disappointed. Service people are not speaking very well english, they don't really care about the comfort of their hosts, if you ask something you will be told that it is not possible or you have to do it by yourself ... Let's hope they are just starting and need to warm up.",,,

Rooms are clean and spacious, service was outstanding, breakfast is standard Holiday Inn. There are some fast food restaurants nearby, like Carl's Jr, Jack in the box, Wendy's and Little Caesar's. Will definitely stay here again, have to mention that price was more than adequate. The staff was very polite and friendly. The hotel is far from everything, very close to the border with Mexico. We went for a three days stay and everything was great...I read the reviews before booking this hotel and must agree with most of them. I read someone saying that this hotel was boring and there was nothing to do so, it was perfect for me since I was looking for a hotel not close to a highway and far from everything, this was it! My only ""complaint"" is that the carpet in the hallway could use some deep cleaning or be completely replaced. Stayed here in March for a concert at Cricket. While the hotel was well off the beaten path, it worked out well for us. Hard to get a bite to eat though. Wendy's at the Pilot gas station down the street was the closest option...That's something you should know if you decide to stay out this way. The hotel itself was very nice. Good rooms, comfortable beds and nice staff. The breakfast in the morning is up to par with any other HI Express, so it was good. This property is very close to the Border - that wasn't a factor for me, but it makes some folks uncomfortable. I didn't have any anxiety about it and I don't think that you should either. If you need to be down this way, well away from the heart of San Diego, this is a fine place to stay the night. The room was very good and clean. The breakfast was adequate. But the location is not very close to city attractions. I would recommend if you want good hotel at good price and willing to commute little cheap, nice, a little far from downtown but its worth it I had business in Tijuana Mexico across from the Otay Mesa border crossing. I like to stay on the US side when possible and this hotel is about 1/2 mile from the border. The hotel is newer, clean and quiet. Everything in the room worked well. This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and again, I was pleased. I like the Holiday Inn Express setup. The shower head always works well, there were two kinds of pillows, hard and soft. The free internet access was fast! The desk was big enough and plenty of sockets for my gizmos. The room also smelled good. What I do is drive my car to the paid parking lot right near the border then walk across and take a taxi to my destination. There is a long line now to enter Mexico and you never know how long the line will be to drive out, so I walk. The line to walk through the check point is almost always faster. Stayed here for 9 nights easy to get to with major highways. Yes, it is very close to the border however it is an easy 20 min car ride to San diego. This saved on city hotel parking fees at $14 a night. Hotel staff very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast nothing exciting but fruit and cereal available as well as greasy stuff. Coffee is horrible there is a Starbucks up the road which really helped. Housekeeping left the room really fresh every day with new soap, towels every day. Great to have a microwave and fridge, laundry was useful too as we needed to freshen clothes as only brought a few. Rooms were spacious - we had a suite which had a little seating area with a sofa bed and table, beds very comfortable and so were the pillows. There are some really good restaurants in Otay ranch to the north 14 miles away or 4miles via 125 toll rd $4.50, local fast food places too. Free internet access and a business centre with a printer so we bough discount tickets before we went to attractions an saved a load of $ doing this too. For our family this was ideal as we got breakfast and no parking fees and were going to be going in the car on trips every day. Easy to get to legoland, San diego zoo, etc, we even ended up in Yuma AZ one day! Better than some 4* i have stayed in you wouldn't know it was rated 2.5*",,,

We had a great stop over with a super room is a great location, excellent friendly staff. Would stay again, reasonable value too.","My husband and I were in Paris for a business trip and he had selected Hotel Chatillon for our stay. I was pleasantly surprised considering some of the reviews I had read on another site. That said, I believe the reviews predated the renovations undertaken at the hotel. We had a double room with a well-kitted out bathroom with a soaker tub. The bathroom had obviously been redone. The rooms were fairly quiet but not completely soundproofed. Also, there was work being done on the facade of the hotel so, if we were working in the room during the afternoon, we had to keep the window closed to minimize the noise. Wifi is available at no extra charge but if you need to use it for several days you'll need to get the password each day. Breakfast is also available at the hotel for 9â¬, which is not bad considering the offering: half a baguette with butter and jam, cheese, viennoiserie (usually a croissant or pain au chocolat), fruit juice, and coffee/hot chocolate/tea. The service from the hotel staff was also very courteous and professional. The only downside to the hotel may be the location. There isn't much to do in the 14th arrondissement but, fortunately, the hotel is located close to a metro station and the tram. We had a great stop over with a super room is a great location, excellent friendly staff. Would stay again, reasonable value too. My daughter and I stayed here for a few days in October. It was friggen awesome. The room is large and Julien at the front desk helped us with whatever our needs of the day were! We made a weak attempt to speak basic French phrases and everyone was so helpful. This hotel is beautiful at such a fantastic rate. SUPER DUPER clean with a large comfortable bed. Nice view, close to everything in Montparnasse and a 15 minute cab or subway ride to all the sights. The subway is very close and very easy to manuever. Wish we had had more time to stay. Again, Julien was the BEST!! This hotel is well-kept and quiet, being set back from the main road in a quiet little cobbled square, which also makes it a little trickier to find than other hotels. We found the staff to be friendly, courteous, smartly dressed and well-organised. The hotel itself is well-maintained and although not luxuriously decorated, still looks appealing on the inside and out. The breakfast dining room was very nice and we actually found preferable for a quiet coffee and croissant than local cafes, unless you want to people-watch in a busier area, or get some fancier pastries. The room we had was simple but smart and clean, and a good size for Paris - the furniture was of a pretty good standard and was modern and all matched, with the added bonus of a decent LCD TV and a safe in the wardrobe. The bathroom looked newly renovated and was decorated to a good standard. It's a short walk (10 minutes or so) to the nearest metro, Porte d'Orleans, which also has a tram stop, although you can walk up to Alesia which is a couple of minutes further in the other direction. There are plenty of bars, brasseries and patisseries nearby. We had no problems with noise, and in fact found the place to be very quiet with regard to street noise - we slept with the window open no problem. We could hear a little of other rooms, but no more so than any other hotel I've been to. I think this is a good value paris hotel, especially if you get a good last minute deal - we got a double room for more than â¬20 per night cheaper than the standard rate. My 84yo aunt and I stayed here for a weekend in May 2011, taking a twin room. The locaation was very quiet when compared to the hustle/bustle of Paris generally. The room had plenty of room when compared to others of same rating / price in Paris. As we were in Paris to see relatives we didn't use the Metro, but it was noted that it was not far away from the hotel. So although the hotel is a little isolated from the general sightseeing areas they would be easily accessed by public transport. The only downside is a general comment about hotels in mainland Europe is having no way of making a cuppa in the rooms, having to rely on going out for a drink. As star ratings tend to be variable and we weren't sure how from the main centre this hotel was we were not sure what we were going to, but we were pleasantly impressed. The staff were welcoming, the room was clean and well decorated, the shower / toilet area looked like it had just been decorated and was lovely! It's a 15 minute walk to the central area of Paris and 5 minute walk from the nearest metro so it was easy to get about either by foot or Metro. Plenty of restraurants/brasseries/bars within a few minutes walk as well. We were very happy with our stay there. My daughter and I stayed at Hotel Chatillon, choosing it because of good reviews on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. Even though our French is pretty non-existent, our hosts were gracious, friendly, and helpful. The nicely decorated room did not have air conditioning, but we did not need it as the windows opened to lovely street views. It was one of my favorite places that we stayed on our trip because it was what I imagined a small hotel in Paris would be. And we got great advice on a nearby bakery so our men at home received yummy pastries that night. (Note: pastries are difficult to get home from Paris but WORTH it!) Really pleasant stay! The staff is competent and polite, the area incredibly calm and the place (room, hall, breakfast room) totally clean.. There is always a person at the reception day and night, you can sleep peacefully. The surroundings are nice : AlÃ©sia, Montparnasse, Denfert Rochereau : shopping, french ""bistrots"", parks... I really enjoyed the area! I used to live in the neighbourhood where this hotel is located and I have stayed there several times since returning to North America. I once stayed there for five weeks. Under the previous owners, this was a very pleasant and reasonably priced place to stay. The owners were hands-on and they cared about their guests. The location is actually quite good if one knows the city and how to get around, although I understand why some people who are unfamiliar with Paris, or who want to be very central have expressed reservations about the locale. Unfortunately, the ownership has changed, we saw the new owners only briefly during our stay and the staff who actually run things leave a lot to be desired. The front desk clerk - the same one referred to in the review below - should not be in the hotel business. He comes off as a martinet, and he is both irritating and unhelpful. Equally importantly, we got quite a surprise when we received out bill, which did not accord with information on their web site. When we attempted to discuss this, the martinet decided to play gatekeeper between us and the manager and went into full blown bureaucratic mode. Rather than address the problem, he treated us to a lot of empty, evasive verbiage. The change in how this hotel is managed is very sad. I will not be staying there again.",,,
aturkinnola,634899,"Great location, good breakfast, free wi-fi. Next to a mall with a few good restaurants. You can walk to Zona Rosa. Easy access to the historic center or the park. Rooms are modern and comfortable. I had only one problem. The room was very cold in January. The heating is available only after 8 pm and my room's heating did not work at all. I did not ask for a different room so I do not know if this is a systemwide problem. Barcelona is a gorgeous city and this hotel is the perfect companion. It is in a great location to walk around and right in front of a subway station and pretty close to the airport bus. Comfortable rooms, free and fast wi-fi, atmospheric cafe. Hard to complain.","Great location, good breakfast, free wi-fi. Next to a mall with a few good restaurants. You can walk to Zona Rosa. Easy access to the historic center or the park.

I did not ask for a different room so I do not know if this is a systemwide problem. The rooms are plain and average, they have a small restaurant where they serve breakfast, but they don't do any other meals, however you can go to the mall that is right next door to get a bite. They have complementary WiFi I enjoyed my stay while I was in town doing business. Service was ok. Rooms clean. The entrance has a nice lounge and at night the have a man playing the piano if you just want to relax at the lounge. The hotel recommends that you use the taxis at the Hotel, but be careful because those guys have a rate triple the normal rate because they know that we are mostly foreigners. Its up to you!! They used to say taxis would do kidnappings but that has dropped in the last years do you govt officials stepping in and all taxis have the persons ID posted on the window. . Breakfast is not bad. Very happy with the Holiday Inn on Reforma. We had a huge room on 12 floor with a great view of the city. Little traffic noise and a good buffet style breakfast. Hotel taxis were inexpensive and always available. WiFi signal in the room was a bit weak so the staff gave us a USB cable to use. Location is very good four tourists as all the main sights are nearby. I would stay here again. I stayed at this hotel in October 2011 and was very pleased with my stay. The service was excellent and the room was very clean, modern and comfortable. This hotel serves a business trip purpose very well. The mattress was a little too firm for my taste, but I ended up sleeping very well, despite it. The breakfast, which was included in the price was delicious! The value for the price of the stay was very reasonable, and I would stay here again on my next business trip to Mexico City. This is a bed and breakfast hotel with a modern style (not common for this type of hotel). Rooms are equally modern and nice. Service is average but location is great. You not only have the privilege of being in the nice Reforma Avenue but also you have a shopping mall next to the hotel. Therefore you can walk around and also you can go to the movie theater if you want or you can enjoy the nice Chinese restaurant in the mall. I stayed at this hotel for just one night in a trip to Mexico City. It is located in Paseo de la Reforma, and if you are interested in visiting El Zocalo square, it is not too far away from it. I was surprised about the size of the room, it was much bigger than I expected. The same happened with the shower, it was huge! The bed was just perfect, kingsize with four pillows, exactly what I needed after spending the whole day walking through the Teotihuacan pyramids and Antara mall. The room was perfectly isolated from outside noise, so I slept like a baby. It also had everything you see in most hotels: TV, security box, coffee machine, Wi-Fi (which I didn't use, but I suppose that works properly). The only thing I didn't like was the breakfast, very poor in my opinion. Overall, considering its location and price, it is a good choice if you are looking for a comfortable and affordable hotel in the centre of Ciudad de Mexico. This hotel is something remarkable! Huge room, super tidy, free cofee, very very nice stuff - all of them from FD, houskeeping, all at the restaurant, everybody was nice and friendly. The breakfast was absolutly worthy, the hotel is great placed... I just dont know what to mention first. Thanks for marvelous stay. Key to the room didn't work. Went downstairs to complain, had to make a line again. New key did not work either so we asked for a room change, which they provided. Key worked. Back at night, key did not work. The staff said ""it's the batteries"". We had problems with that everyday, it was awful because it delayed us all the time. Hotel smells, like someplaces and carpets are dirty. It looks like the hotel hasn'd had proper manteinance since it was built. Pay $10 more and stay at other hotel. This hotel is functional, big rooms, no luxuries, located bang on Reforma and close to many attractions. Centrally located. Service was ok, breakfast is basic. The staff manage basic English and in general cooperative. I stayed at this hotel while on business in Mexico City. The hotel itself is very nice inside, as well as the rooms. My room is fairly large with a nice view and a huge shower. Also, the room is very clean. The internet works fine and is of decent speed. I did had two network cables already in the room waiting for me. The breakfast is also very good, sausage, eggs, coffee and juice. The location is very nice because there is a mall at the bottom of the hotel. You can find alot of shopping as well as Starbucks right outside the hotel entrance and a good amount of food options. The only thing that doesn't work very well is the TV, the signal cuts in and out alot. Otherwise a very nice hotel at a reasonable rate. I stayed here for almost two weeks and the only positive point which I can mention about this hotel is that the staff is quite friendly. Being on a business trip, I needed internet connection (regardless whether WIFI or cable) - the advertised ""High speed Internet connection"" was ALLWAYS low (my PC indicated that it was on the lowest level that could be measured), getting a cable for the alternative connection took TWO working days, although I was promised to get it within 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the cable connection was not faster and I was quite often not able to access the internet at all. The breakfast buffet is boring and every day the same, minimalistic food is offered. The room was big but the carpet was filthy and full of stains. I will definately select another hotel for my next business trip to Mexico City I stayed for four nights and booked online for the room with a view. So it was to my utter disappointment when I checked in and they tried to pass a regular room for something I had paid extra for. Of course there was the usual yada yada about the room not being ready--they could have saved me the trip upstairs with a nice apology, because I was willing to wait. Anyway, that being said, the right room on the right floor turned out spacious, clean and perfectly amenable. No bath tub but water pressure was good and showers were sizable. This hotel though seems to be running on very little staff--there was never more than ONE person behind the front desk while I was there..so this person had to answer calls and do front of store duties to the detriment of everyone! Why they think they can manage on such meager man power is beyond me. Certainly, the front desk was always in a rush to ferry you off. Just getting them to get help for their laundry was a forty minute waste of time and effort. There is no room service in this hotel, which I find rather strange for what claims to be geared for businessmen. The business center is a sad hole with hardly anything working. Oh and the free wi-fi in the hotel suffers from intermittent failure. Really quite useless. The gym is a sad story too. Breakfast was your most basic hotel fare--no specials here, nothing different from the most basic of cafeteria fare served in a cafeteria manner. So, no, I did not look forward to breakfast on any day. That being said, the place seems fairly central and is beside a great mall with good restaurants, shopping and movie theaters. The Museo Antropolgica and Modern Art are but short bus rides away in nearby Chapultepec Park and Zona Rosa has it's own fair share of interesting characters. Would I stay here again, given the many charms of Mexico City? I think I can fare better elsewhere.",,,

Good value for money. My wife and I stayed here for 3 days. We had a triple room with a double bed and a single bed. The room was basic but a reasonable size, clean with a TV and tea making facilities. The en suite was a bit small. You have to sit sideways on the toilet!. The metal shower was good but there was nowhere to put soap etc. There were plenty of towels provided. Our room was quiet on Thursday and Friday but there was more noise on Saturday night presumably due to the other guests. Breakfast started at 6.30 in the week and at 8 on weekends. The basic breakfast consisted of two sausages, two slices bacon, 1 egg, 2 tomatoes, 3 three mushrooms, two tomatoes and baked beans. This came with as much toast as you required. Cereals, yogurts etc were also provided. Service was cheerful and very efficient. We went when breakfast started and never had to queue. Overal great value for London at Â£80 per day. A good Italian restaurant nearby was Chix Chocs. The hotel is 5 minutes from the underground but only 3 minutes from the shops-buses. This is a basic B and B, clean and a good location. There is no bar and the breakfast room can get a little crowded. The staff were helpful and polite. This guest house is in a superb location being just a short walk down a very pleasant side street to the main road where there are plenty of bars and restaurants. The owner is friendly and attentive without being overbearing and the general feel of the guest house is one of cleanliness and comfort. Our room was large with a bay window and had everything you would expect including digital tv. The breakfast was very good quality. I don't think you can go wrong with this one if you are looking for good value accommodation close to the capital. We were looking for a nice, quiet and reasonably priced hotel for a visit with our daughter in London. While we've stayed in some hotels in downtown areas, many of the hotels are either too high priced, in a ""dodgy"" area, or funky/not well maintained. We are not afraid of going further afield nor of riding the Tube, so when we stumbled across Heatherbank, we decided to give it a try-- what a great choice. Jackie Patel, family, and staff run this boutique hotel in North Finchley, not far from the Woodside Park tube station on the Northern line. The hotel is on a quiet street, about 500 meters from the Tube station and about 200 meters from the High Street with shops, restaurants. Jackie was not bothered at all when we arrived at 1130 at night, nor with our need to sleep in the next day! The hotel is a set of old houses that they have been refurbishing very nicely and the rooms are filled with cool old touches like scalloped ceilings, beautiful woodwork, etc. Full breakfast is included-- pretty much anything you would like! The hotel also features a huge backyard that we would have loved to have used when we traveled with kids (but in the summer, it looks like it would be an oasis to rest in, too). Parking is a bit tough in the area, but there are spots available in front of the hotel (we just tubed it-- about 25 minutes to King's Cross). Some folks would find that too far, but we figured it was a small price to pay for a great hotel at a reasonable cost. Bathrooms are small, but functional and clean-- and equipped with instant hot water for showers. A little noise from people coming and going, but not much more than you'd have at any other hotel Downsides? not many that I can think of... Would be great if they'd move a few hundred meters closer to the tube (just kidding!). Not a lot of nightlife around (a few pubs), but we're not really into Discos and all-night partying anyway. They are upgrading mattresses and had not replaced ours yet, but it needed it. Despite these would we stay there again? You Bet!",,,
Anne T,2166238,"seeemed pleasant from booking site. staff pleasant. breakfast adequate. The room was in the basement and very hot despite window being open; tv reception was intermittant but put that down to being in the basement. There was a damp smell as if a hot water tank had overflowed complained and was told it would be seen too; they did sort out light bulbs. The smell was still evident later that day so complained again when left hotel in the morning also told them that would not recommend them to anyone. Amazing, beautiful and perfect location. Rooms are very clean and had everything we needed. The roof terrace is perfect for a evening drink. Staff very helpful. Lots of shops and places to eat nearby and the metro is just round the corner. I will never stay anywhere else. We are a mature aged couple and found the hotel centrally located with helpful staff. The hotel had a lovely european feel which we appreciated after coming from Australia. The breakfast was excellent with real coffee being offered. We felt most secure and this hotel would be excellent for the women traveller. We look forward to returning to this hotel. I occasionally travel to LA on business in the downtown area and have returned to the Kawada each time. For my purposes, the location cannot be beat. Shopping is good and you can walk to the fashion district, Chinatown, Toy District etc. As a female traveler, I feel very safe here. There is plenty to do and see without having to deal with parking problems and expenses. After seeing my room, a coworker changed to this hotel. I have found the rooms I've been in to be clean, comfortable and functional, at a reasonable price - otherwise I would not have returned. There is a 24 hour Vietnamese restaurant next door and a daytime breakfast/lunch restaurant adjoining the hotel. You are 2 blocks (less then a 3 minute walk) to the Grand Market which is open daily until 6 pm - it is filled with a variety of food stands, fruit stands and a store where you can buy a variety of items - groceries, pots - pans and hygene items. The Hotel staff is excellent, and can communicate in several languages. When I had to set up an after hours meeting and needed privacy, they arranged for me to have a private room with a conference table and internet with no notice. All I can say if you are not happy with your room, let the staff know - I am sure they will fix the problem Negative items include the TV service, which can cut in and out at different times and the internet can take some ""tweaking"" to get it to work. When I had problems, hotel fixed my internet problems and did not charge me for the service my entire stay. This boutique hotel is a perfect place to stay in Istanbul! It was my first trip to Istanbul, only 2 days stopover, together with friends. The hotel location couldn't be better. Very close to the most beautiful and famous heritage sites (all in walking distance), convenient to reach from the airport, close to nice restaurants but still quite and a fabulous seaview. The rooms are very nice and convenient. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We felt rather like being family members than hotel guests. Already the reservation process was great. Answers came quick and very helpful and very friendly and personall. Once arrived, everything was well organized. The breakfast was wonderful - amazing variety for a small hotel with only 10 rooms. Fresh and delicious with local specialities. You have to try the homemade cookies! In the morning we got a lot of useful hints for our sightseeing tour. And the restaurant recommendations have been very good too. If you like jogging - don't forget your running shoes.

Very good breakfast in the morning (I specially enjoyed the home made cookies!). Natalie - the reception lady - was a wonderful host, she helped me with instructions how to reach different places (including Cevahir mall :)) ). I arrived early in the morning, well before check-in time and I left after check-out time. My luggage was very well kept at the reception and I want to say thank you again for the hospitality offered. The hotel is 30 min from Ataturk airport (40TL by taxi). We just come back from 1 week at Istanbul where we spent 7 nights at Eternity Hotel. The hotel is perfectly situated and the rooms are clean, large and very nice. The staf is simply perfect very friendliness, answering all our cquestions, giving us a lot of informations and advices about how to move and to visit each place. The breakfast was wonderfull, all the cakes and jams were prepared by a kind lady from the hotel ! I plane to go back next year, I'll probably book in that hotel !

Great location, just a block from the Four Seasons in the older part of Istanbul. Very touristy area, but if you're planning to stay in the area, then we highly recommend Eternity. Incredibly friendly and helpful owners - family-owned, English-speaking. Clean, modern, yet quaint. And unbelievable value. Thanks for such a pleasant experience! Great location. near Aya Sofia and the entrance to Topaki Palace. The rooms are quite small, but very nice. Could have better sleep quality, to much light and the breakfast is also not so good. Nice value for money! We spent the last week of October 2011 at the Eternity. Booked a room on the top floor with a private terrace and wonderful view of the Marmara Sea. Very comfortable and peaceful -we could watch the boats enter the Bosphorus all day. Quiet location near all the major sites. A very clean room, bed extremely comfortable and a basic breakfast (bread, coffee, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt and fruit) is served in a sunny welcoming room on the ground floor (with the option of sitting outside). The staff were knowledgeable, friendly and available to help when needed. A very memorable stay! Thanks especially to Nathalie. :) My wife and I weren't sure where to stay for our first visit to Istanbul -- the quaint, cozy streets of Sultanahmet or the thriving nite scene of Tunnel. Althogh we spent most our nights running around Tunnel (although we typically had more fun at the nargile bars just down from the Eternity), we were surely glad to return to the peace and tranquility of Hotel Eternity. We woke every morning to an incredible view of the Bosphorus, and were greeted by the warm and friendly hotel staff -- most notably Natalie. She was amazing!!! She offered so many great recommendations and always did it with a smile. Do yourself a favor and look no further than Eternity. Eternity's convenience to attractions, scenic views, and really reasonable prices helped to make our vacation a really memorable one. We were in Istanbul only for a few days. the hotel was just behind Agia Sofia in Sultanahmet. Not busy as it was at the end of all the other hotels' pedestrian road and at the same time next to the taxi rank. Walking only 3mns for the tram (once you know where its going its much easier to move around with it as Istanbul has heavy and long rush hour times..) would defiantly go back to this hotel if on pleasure and not business. We had Absolutely delightful experience and a very pleasant stay in this lovely ,superb, cozy boutique hotel . The staff is the friendliest hotel staff we have ever met in Istanbul Ã¯ï¿½Å  specially "" Natalie Dane"" The lovely lady at the reception , she helped us a lot , anything you need, she hooks you up with the most beautiful of smiles :) the room was very clean and the beds very comfortable. the location was excellent for both sightseeing and restaurants, easy walking distance to all main attraction and near all historical places. Breakfast is good . We loved everything and we Will definitely return to eternity hotel .""highly recommend The ranking of the hotel was perfect. So far. But then Bonnie&Clyde arrived there and got a room in the ground floor, right next to the lobby. It was noisy but the owner of the hotel and the staff understood our problem. However, they couldn't offer us another room because the hotel was fully booked. We ""suffered"" two days but were upgraded on days three and four. Third floor, terrace, Marmara-Sea-view, not noisy at all, clean and save. Apart from the rooms the hotel itelsf is centrally located (walking distance (5 minutes) to Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace). Conclusion: If you book via booking.com don't chose the cheapest rate. Otherwise you will be on lobby-level. All in all a very, very nice and friendly hotel. Thus, 4 points. I stayed here for 4 night in Oct 2011. I couldn't have chosen a better hotel based on its extreme close proximity to major sites such as Topkapi Palace, Aya Spohia, Blue Mosque & Hippodrome (literally 5-10mins walk). Within walking to everything important. Hotel is at the end of a road full of great vibey restaurant & bars. Arasta Bazaar is 5mins walk away (great place to shop for some special finds). The hotel inside is modern. The rooms are spacious (I stayed in the Ruby room - ground floor), very comfortable beds (crisp clean linen). The bathroom is great (shower head superb). Coffee & tea facilities in room, complimentary bottle of wine, water & fruit. WIFI available. Nothing lacking in room in my opinion. I was on the roadside - though did not find it noisy. You can hear the call to prayer - I got used to it - but you could use earplugs. Taxi rank across the street. Breakfast - cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, pastries,boilded eggs, tea & coffee. Scrambled eggs etc would be at extra cost. The Staff are GREAT, friendly & helpful - Herman & Natalie (has good shopping advice) - thank you for a great stay - I will return! Fantastic place to stay in Istanbul Ã¢â¬â great location, very close to all the sights and at the quiet end of a street with lots of interesting restaurants and shops. The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful, and the rooms are individual and comfortable. I looked at lots of hotel options before choosing this one and am so glad I did Ã¢â¬â you cannot beat this boutique hotel for location, service and style.",,,
P G,617683,"The lobby area is very nice and staff are friendly. Our room was a decent size, comfortable and clean. It is not overly luxurious but still very nice. The bed was a little uncomfortable which was the only downside to the bed. On our second night, we discovered that we were missing a coffee maker in the room. So I called and they said they would send someone up - it was about 11:00 at night, and the gentleman that came with the coffee maker said he had to install it, he couldn't just leave it with us. So then there was some guy in our room for about 10 minutes putting in the coffee maker which I thought was a little odd and unfortunate that they didn't check the room first. Wireless internet costs an extra $15 per night. When you book the room, I would ask for the i-connect package. You can't get it at check in, but if you get it ahead of time, it is $11 a night for wireless internet plus unlimited phone calls - a much better deal. We went to the restaurant downstairs for buffet breakfast. Definitely NOT worth it. It was a weekday (not sure if it is better on weekends), but it was $23 per person and the food was not very good, and I would have thought there would be more variety for $23. The chef who was supposed to make eggs and omelettes for you was often on a smoke break which is not helpful when you are in a rush for breakfast. At check-in, a very rude woman (black woman, short hair with red streaks) stated there were no rooms available and we had to wait. No apology, no nothing. Just a to bad you are going to have to wait. I was thrown off by this. When I came back five minutes later to ask a question, a young man helped me. He stated he did not understand why I was not checked-in before, apologized and gave me my room key. Unfortunately during the night, the AC broke. It was very hot and i requested a fan. It took them over 3 hours to come up, didnt show up till 2 am. Christian Rios went out of his way to apologize and check-in with me while I waited for the fan. He again called the following day to make sure everything was ok. It is incredible to me how the hotel can have such extremes in customer service! Sep/Oct 2011. Stayed one night at the beginning of our trip and two at the end. Staff very friendly and although the rooms were in need of a little redecoration, they were very clean with comfortable beds and working TV, Fridge etc. Staff very accommodating when we requested additional pillows. Nice continental breakfast.Ten minute walk to Bologna Metro station - easy enough to find if you have a map and the hotel sell the metro tickets. BIG BONUS is a new local restaurant (2 mins walk) Rosso Liziano - this is not a 'tourist' restaurant. The pizza's are HUGE and really really good, as are the seafood pasta dishes and the mushroom risotto - the best evening meals of our 10 day trip. Their menu items have really funny English 'translations' such as 'porky mushroom' and 'hypocrite steak on the grate' but the food is delicious and cheap (as is the house red wine). From the hotel door: turn right up to the street, turn right again and walk approx 50 metres to the main road - Rosso Liziano Restaurant is on the opposite side of the road, diagonally to the left. Enjoy! I recently took a trip with my fiance to Mexico and stayed at Azul Fives. We stayed in a one bedroom condo with a solarium and it was absolutely stunning. We had a few minor issues with our room (toilet problems) but they were quickly solved by the staff and followed up by a phone call to ensure we were satisfied. The beach area is kept clean and the staff is there ready to wait on you (all over the resort from the front desk to maintenance) to make certain your stay is the best stay possible. The selection of food at the restaurants was good. They are building two more restaurants right now to offer more of a food selection. I love the option to have a meal right on the beach at night....soooo romantic. If my fiance and I had stayed longer we definitely would've done this. I look forward to going back again next year, At check-in, a very rude woman (black woman, short hair with red streaks) stated there were no rooms available and we had to wait.

The hotel room was clean and comfortable, and the staff are very very friendly. The gym is also good, and you get free wifi if you sign up for their ""select guest"" program (as well as a free beverage delivered to your room in the morning). But do not expect anything contemporary. The furniture in the room is clearly from the 70s, with large floral drapes, and crazy carpeting. They also still had a very small tube tv with spotty reception - we made the mistake of ordering a pay-per-view movie. It was $18 after tax and the picture on the small tv was not clear. But overall, still a good hotel.","This 3 star hotel in Rome was pretty good considering the price. The room was clean, but pretty small, also (as another user mentioned) TV only had Italian programs; but on the other hand you don't go to Rome to spend all your time in the hotel room. Breakfast was good, actually better than expected. One downside would be that it was pretty noisy, but this could have been due mostly to the fact that our room was close to the stairway, and you could easily hear people when they were going up and down the stairs (this is not a good thing, especially if you have trouble sleeping). The staff was ok. Transportation to city center was also very good. Close to the hotel you can find a bus station, from which you can take bus 542 to Bologna metro station (and from there 3 stations to Termini or 5 stations to Colosseum) or bus 61 also to Bologna metro station or to Barberini metro station. Taking a 3 day pass that costs 11 euros (one trip costs 1 euro), for both metro and bus, is a really good deal. All in all, this is a good hotel, considering the good price, and if you don't like busy areas like Termini. this was supposed to be a romantic break as it was our honeymoon, but we didnt get that. Walls are very thin! our room was between a family with a yelling child . The child cried all the time and was in and out of both rooms and up and down the corridor. Next they disappeared and a party of students arrived and these were even worse, no control what so ever! shouting screaming, banging doors, in and out of each others rooms, by 2am my husband had enough and opened the door and told them all to be quiet as people trying to sleep! The night staff did nothing my husband went down to ask him to do something about it and he was asleep on the sofa covered up!! The good point is that it is clean with plenty of hot water. Nice little hotel 10 minutes from Bologna metro station by foot and than only 5 metro stops from Colosseo where all the sightseeing starts. Cleaniness is ok and the walls are fairly thin. I could hear the neighbor snore so bring your ear plugs. Rooms are decent size, big bathroom. For a sightseeing trip where you don't spend much time in the hotel perfect. The cheap price makes it well worth it. Breakfast is small but good. Free internet. You have a televison but only italian except MTV sometimes in English. We stayed at the Osimar Hotel for the weekend when visiting Rome to explore the sights. The hotel is located in a residential neighbourhood. It is a ten minute walk from Bologna Metro Station. It is a healthy walk from the sights, approximately 40 minute walk from the Colosseum and over an hour (approx 8 km) walk from Vatican City, so in staying here, you need to be comfortable taking metro lines or walking quite a distance. The hotel is clean and simple, no frills. The breakfast is basic, continental style. For what we paid it was a positive experience. Shuttle service was offered to and from the airport for a good price. Staff was pleasant. A note to the ladies: bring your own hairdryer, the one supplied takes quite a while to do the job. The hotel was nice and quiet with a very good breakfast. Sep/Oct 2011. Stayed one night at the beginning of our trip and two at the end.

Enjoy! The hotel is quite small, very old fashioned and is located quite far from the city centre, but quite close to Bologna Metro station. We requested a double bed, which was two single beds put together, so wasnt very comfortable.TV had no English channels, but it didnt really matter much as we didnt spend much time in the hotel. Breakfast was prettly basic continental - ham, cheese, fruit, cereal, buns, sweet pastries, juice..Coffee was the best part - really delicious even though it was from the machine. We found receptionists quite unfriendly.. All in all, really basic hotel.. the bathroom and the room were clean. And by the way, Wi FI connection was free and really fast! We didnt pay much, so couldnt really expect too much either. Hotel is a good place to stay for a budget break to rome. Its location is good but very hard for taxi drivers to find, 3/4 of ours had never heard of it. The staff were quite friendly. Breakfast was chesse ham and yougurts. Rooms are small but cleaned well and the shower was nice and powerfull. The hotel has a restaraunt 2 mins away for dinner and it is very good and well priced if you are on a budget I took my 60+ inlaws, wife and 2 year old to Rome and stayed in Osimar for 4 nights. It was quite far from the airport and yes it isn't central but it isn't bad at all. The area it is located in has some nice restaurants, good shops and it is only a 10 minute walk to the nearest underground station which can get you in to the centre in about 10 minutes. The hotel itself is quiet, the service functional (noone is overly friendly but not rude-somewhere inbetween) and breakfast is great-lots to eat and drink in continental style. A taxi ride to most places of interest in Rome is about 15 Euros one way. Decided to stay here based on the remarks left on this website. This is a genuine 3* hotel. It is not in the heart of the city (10-15 min walk NE from Bologna Metro station) but it is remarkably good value for such a well maintained hotel. The number 61 bus stops on Via Rudolph Lanciani, about 3 mins away from the hotel. this is useful if you want to take the bus into the city centre rather than walk to Bologna Metro. Nomentana Rail station is a good 15-20 minutes walk away from the hotel. You may choose this if you come in from Fiumencino Airport, as this is on the same line, meaning you do not need to worry about changing trains and losing your bearings. The hotel is situated in a quiet residential street, surrounded by apartments. It is not on the main road and as such it is lovely and quiet. There is a municipal swimming pool next door. The main impression from from walking into the lobby is of a very smart, modern hotel. It is clearly well kept and maintained. The small dining area for breakfast has an outside terrace attached for al fresco breakfasts (continental style: ham and cheese, rolls, yoghurts, juice, coffee). The rooms are generously sized, very very clean and well maintained. The double I stayed in had a huge bed. The walls and carpets and bedding are all very clean. the bathroom also is excellent, with a good shower (no bath) and bidet. The room has airconditioning (a must!) - you may need to ask at reception to switch it on when you arrive. Also a TV which has cable (BBC World) and a mini fridge too. Having stayed in Milan before in a supposedly 3* hotel and was extremely disappointed for its shabbiness and poor maintenance, it would seem this hotel is keen to buck the trend. I would stay here again without hesitation.",,,
azdemocrat,263702,"Okay, I've stayed in great budget hotels and not so great budget hotels. This is somewhere in the middle. Positives: a free breakfast, yes it was just cereal, toast, fruit, yogurt, coffee and juice, but hey that's quite a bit. I didn't mind. Great location with a 5 min walk to the Earl's Court Tube station. A few minutes in either direction to other restaurants and a Marks and Spencer. Quiet street. The ""concierge"" was nice, the housekeeper was a little odd. She asked me if there were any states for ""white people only!"" The room was tiny but it had it's own shower. TV worked. Bed was okay and made up every day by the odd housekeeper. Free WiFi in rooms. Only Negatives: the general noise from other guests: slamming doors late at night, noise through the walls, etc. But I guess that's expected from these B&B's in London. Ear plugs blocked most of it. The place could use a general refurbishment but again, it wasn't too bad and I was in LONDON!!!! Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. First, the location, right on Montparnasse Blvd so there is a limitless choice of eateries right outside the door. And if you turn left out the door and walk aways down the street, there will be a nice view of the Eiffel Tower. There is also a shopping mall across the street. A metro stop is also right outside the door as well, so beware of foot traffic. The room is small as to be expected, but clean and cozy, with free WiFi. The bathroom is the real surprise as it is quite large for a room that is small. The room I stayed in had a shower and tub. There is ample room for toiletries to be put out either in the sink area or on a wall shelf. The bed was comfortable with rather soft linens and extra pillows. The only negatives and they are minor: need better lighting in the bathroom as itâs only in the sink area rather than overhead. The tub wall is high, so short people like me, have to be careful getting out of the tub. I wouldnât have minded a small coffee pot in the room either. I like a cup of coffee as Iâm getting ready. I had a room up high on the 5th floor and toward the back so most of the noise was not evident. But you can still hear the metro rumblings. I bring earplugs when I travel, so this was not a problem. So ask for a back room if you can. I usually put on the fan in the room if not the a/c for âwhiteâ noise, but that was not working as the hotel switched to heat, which I didnât use. So I just cracked my window a bit for fresh air. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Recap: good hotel, great location, good value for the money in Paris.","The hotel is really a budget hotel, was there for 2 nights, beds were not comfortable at all and rooms were small, bathroom was tiny when in it you couldnt even close the door. Breakfast was alright for what you pay for. The one lady that works there kept on talking to herself and at times was very weird. The rooms are not the cleanest, the hotel requires some refurbishment. Okay, I've stayed in great budget hotels and not so great budget hotels. This is somewhere in the middle.

The place could use a general refurbishment but again, it wasn't too bad and I was in LONDON!!!! Great Location just across west brompton Tube station. Nice neghbourhood and fast free wifi. decent sized room. However it could do wtih a refurbishment. Staff were polite and kind, although once the housekeeper forgot to change the towels and do the beds. This was soon rectified. The overall experience is adequate for the price paid. If i had to go to london at the lowest possible price, i would not hesitate to go again. For 50 pounds a night you get what you pay for. Hotel was clean, safe and generally good. The rooms were tiny, but clean. The breakfast isn't great, but again for 50 pounds I was surprised they even had free breakfast. I stay in a lot of budget priced hotels (around ÃÂ£50 per night) in London and this was the worst value and most depressing ever. At half the price it may have been acceptable, but believe me there are much better deals available for the prices quoted. Also be aware that on its website it says (and still does) ""Each room has it own private shower & toilet"" but actually when I got there, I was told this was not the case because my room was booked through an online agency - very misleading. Bathroom and toilet was up two sets of stairs. Lock on the cupboard-sized room had been modified so you could not lock it from the inside when you were asleep (see pics). Bait box for mice/rats found under the bed (see pic) Breakfast poor but seeing as it was seemingly only prepared from a cupboard in the hallway, that's of no real surprise. I was only there to sleep for one night but felt sorry for any tourists staying longer, who were needlessly paying over the odds for apathetic service and a spartan breakfast. In big letters behind the reception desk it says ""No refunds""... You don't need to be a genius to work out why they have chosen to say that. To so openly say, whatever level of service or quality of room you get, we never give any refunds, should be enough to make you look elsewhere. By the way, I post lots of reviews and give feedback to hotels - this is the first where I've said things are anywhere this bad. Yes this isn't promoted as a top notch hotel, but for what you pay, you can reasonably expect more than this. It would be reasonable value at half the price We are a large 7 member family and we enjoy our holidays in London staying for 6 nights in Sara hotel. Its a small, friendly, clean hotel with two nearby tube stations.We would like to thank especially Mohammed who was very helpful and friendly. Vasos and Yerasimos from Cyprus.",,,
LondonMargot,298404,"The Irish staff in this hotel are friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Plenty of communal bathrooms if you don't choose en suite. The only problem is that it is a pub and is extremely noisy at weekends, however, if you get a room on the second floor at the back, the noise level is bearable. Reception welcoming and informative. Room was spotless as was the bathroom. very comfortable bed and room air-conditioned. Complimentary breakfast is either Asian buffet or Continental. The Asian buffet is delicious and better value. The hotel is quiet and in an excellent location near MRT Bugis. Very helpful staff arranged airport shuttle for me before I left. I will recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again.","The Irish staff in this hotel are friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Plenty of communal bathrooms if you don't choose en suite. The only problem is that it is a pub and is extremely noisy at weekends, however, if you get a room on the second floor at the back, the noise level is bearable. Couple running the establishment are wonderful...breakfasts are good but it is very noisey on the weekends because of the Irish Pub. For the price I really think you do ok. We got the room with the ensuite, and be honest you pay $150 per night, inc breakfast, to be right in the middle of the Rocks. The rooms are run down, but they are clean and the staff are terrific. Its a really friendly place to stay. BUT. If you want to sleep before 12:30 am you can pretty well forget it. We thought we would be safe from the noise by moving from a bedroom on the street to off the street but the Saturday night band played louder. And on Saturday morning they set up the market from 3am. Having said all that, if you want a drink or a meal or you want to listen to the band without staying at the hotel, then its well worth a visit. It is hard to know where to start with this hotel. Perhaps I could overlook the 5 toenails I found on the floor throughout our stay, the fact our beds were only made about twice during the 8 horrible days we stayed there and the pounding music until midnight, if it wasn't for the way we were treated by the staff. I am a 22 year old backpacker and had spent the year staying in $20-a-night hostels, and never have I been treated like we were here! We asked the woman in charge, Yvonne, if we could please change rooms as my bed was completely broken - she said, ""Jesus! Give me a break!"" sighed and showed us a different room but said ""You can move now or not at all girls I can't move you again after this. She's just a baby anyway she can sleep anywhere!"" So, naturally, we decided to stay where we were, and the solution was to turn the bed on it's side and I slept for the week on a mattress on the floor! Unbelievable. At the end of our stay we simply left the keys in the room and left so we didn't have to talk to her again! Horrible. Above a pub, hunt down the bartender to check in-no front desk. LUg your bags up three floor walkup - no bellhop. No phone, no adapter, no hand towels or face towels, just two towels someone probably used to wash their car, filthy rug, dusty headboard, scuzzy, stained bedspread, T.V. From the 1980's, dirty wall. I won't go on anymore other than to say the location is great, but I was horrified we had to sleep there! Travelling on your own in Australia is not easy, the reason being that very few hotels have single rooms. This means you always have to pay for a double room (or an apartment for 2 adults and 4 kids) , i.e. you pay at least twice the price all the time (unless you want to sleep in a dorm of course). One exception is the Mercantile Hotel in Sydney! I could not believe my eyes when they said they actually had a single room!! For only 80 AUS$ including breakfast! This is less than I paid anywhere else during my 3 week trip to Australia. OK, my room was very simple and the view was towards the street. And I shared bathrooms with the other hotel guests. This was not a problem, however, since there were four bathrooms and very few guests. And sometimes I had to use ear plugs because the music in the pub downstairs was too loud for me to fall asleep. But all in all, this was the best place I stayed. Nice to get back to the hotel late at night, to the pub full of people and live music. And the restaurant served great food! If I ever come to Sydney again, I will stay here. You can't beat the location of the Mercantile, but they have a nasty attitude. We arrived in the pouring rain, and we had to carry our own luggage up three flights of stairs. There is no bell boy, and the woman who checked us in did not help. When I asked her for two extra towels, she threw them on my wet backpack. When I asked her for a second luggage rack, she said, ""This is not the Hilton."" I had asked her nicely. The room was clean, and there is soap, but no shampoo. I asked for a quiet room, but there was alot of street noise, including some construction while we were there. There is no desk to check in, and you have to pay your bill during limited day time hours. At breakfast, we asked the cook for some tomatoes (which I saw in front of him), instead of pork. He made a sarcastic remark, but gave me the tomatoes anyway. The last morning, when we had to leave very early for the airport, I asked if we could get some cheese and rolls and juice the night before, since breakfast was included. I got a firm ""no."" I got another retort about, ""This is not the Hilton."" Overall, the room was clean, and the location great, but for $140, they really should dump the attitude, and perhaps have a full time desk for check in and luggage help. stayed for 3 nights. room is basic but for just over $100 a night for the room in the rocks is a bargain especially at the ""Rocks"". you don't come to Sydney to sit in your room anyway. pub is down stairs and is good for a drink or two especially at weekends. room was serviced every day which is rare in Oz. would recommend to couples and young people who want to stay in city centre on the cheap and not in a hostel. Would definitely stay again Staying at The Mercantile reminded me of solo travels through Ireland years ago -- scent of stale beer in the air, modest room, decent price, great location. The owners get bonus points for modern clean shared bathrooms on the hall. All in all, a fine pick for budget accommodations if you're not planning to spend much time in the room. I have been staying at the Mercantile for the past 12 years and have found it to be an enjoyable and always a comfortable stay.We always come down there every year from the Gold coast and we stay for 3 days for the rugby bledisloe cup.The staff and food are great and we dont worry about the noise.Looking forward to being there in September again for another awesome 3 days. Steve.S Great value and as we had a room at the back on the top floor(3rd) didn't suffer the noise that some reviewers have talked about but this is a working pub with live music every night.The decor was dated and a little threadbear but CLEAN with comfortable bed. The ensuite had a seperate shower and bath with plenty of hot water. Staff were very helpfull and friendly. There is a lock up room to store your luggage on the last day. Good mix of tourists and locals in the bar at night. The whole place reminded me very much of OSheas Talbot Street Dublin!!!! The only possible down side is there are no lifts so a bit of a struggle getting the luggage up to the room but again on leaving a staff member took the wifes bags down.",,,
Kovan888,610914,"We stayed for 3 nights at Marlin Apartrments Canary South in Dec 2012.. The apartment is clean and has quite a nice and comfortable interior. I like the complete cooking facility and spaciousness of the apartment. However it is not easy to locate the place and we had to walk quite a distance from Canary Wharf station (with our heavy luggage ) to the hotel. A few people we asked on the way do not seem to know where this hotel is located. The staff is rather unfriendly and aloof and it can feel quite scary to walk back to the hotel along the dimly lit street late at night. At the end of our stay we were told that we would have to 150 pounds for losing the room key as they would need to change the lock! Although this rule was stated in the service agreement in fine print in view of the exorbitant charge, it should be clearly highlighted to us verbally when we check in or in the email booking confirmation. So make sure you don;t lose the key. Most moden hotels and service aparatments have the digital card key system but Marlin Apartments are still fitted with keys. The receptionist merely asked us to sign the form and said that a security deposit of 200 pounds would be deducted from our credit card to pay for any damages. They refused to waive the charges even though the key was misplaced whilst we were in the room and therefore there is no security risk. . We had also assumed wrongly that the service would be as fine and professional as that at Fraser's apartment Canary wharf (which is nearer to the train station and of much better quality in terms of service , furnishing and view)..

Reception lady was beautifully mannered and welcoming. The apartment it self was stunning with fantastic views! If I could of stayed there longer I would of. Recommend to everyone I just got back from this apartment yesterday 03/10/11, where I booked studio flat. Let me tell you its just like renting a council flat, there is a charge xtra for basically everything, for example there is parking but you need to pay an xtra ÃÂ£15 per night. When we got to the place there was about 6 or 7 rubbish bags by the lift blocking the way not to mention the smell and that took ages to be cleared, the walls need all around maintenance. The corridor for the flats looks like student hall small and narrow, the cleaner blocked our flat door with her trolley and didn't even come to move it when we called the person staying in the flat came out to move it and apologise saying the cleaner was inside his flat. Every time we went to reception there seemed to be a unhappy customer. Now I don't know if people are aware of this but you can't have a pull down bed and called it a luxury flat and even worse no air con, in the times we live in air con is a must, the room was boiling hot because we were facing the sun and overlooking the estates across the road...nice... We went to reception to ask about it and the smart staff lady said that in England it doesn't get that hot so there is no need for air con, I'm sorry but I live in London and not so far from canary wharf in the past 5 to 10 year it has been very hot during the summer not for the whole of it but in patches. I have paid ÃÂ£100 per night in these supposed luxury flats but if I knew what it would be like I never would. Marlin apartments need a lot of improvements if their to get to luxury status. We took 2 apartments at Canary South for a week working in Docklands and the rooms were reasonably decent for the cost of just over ÃÂ£90 pp pn. The corridors and common areas do need a coat of paint but our apartments were in decent condition, the 2 bedroom had floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the thames and canary wharf with brand new blinds being fitted as we arrived. The kitchen area was well setup and would allow cooking every night without missing anything including built in washing machine/dishwasher. the area is safe with canary wharf about 15min walk and south quay DLR around 10, the fire brigade based next door were always quiet at coming/going. If the apartments could improve one thing this would be to offer wifi in the rooms. I've been in London with some collegs for the Excel Exposition. I've had a family apartment -bedrooms are very spacious, huge living room with very nice kitchen and with a lovely view to the river! I am not such a good cooker... but in that kitchen you can find anything you need! The best part was that I forget to live the keys when I left the apartments and the lady from Reception call to remind me so I will not get charged for it. I enjoy my stay I hope all of you will... Bed bugs, broken toilet seat, cold shower on last day, uneven floor boards, the list goes on. What a shame, these spacious, modern apartments could be lovely. My complaint about bed bugs received an apology but my suggestion of compensation was ignored. Would I stay there again - no way! Any tips on how to deal with bed bugs as my clothes are sure to be contaminated? First visit to a Marlin property - staying in Canary Wharf on business for a couple of days and decided that I fancied a change from the hotel. First impressions are good however as other reviewers suggest, when you scratch the surface a few problems. Kitchen is well equipped, but one of the overhead cupboard doors was nearly off it's hinges. Sofa has clearly seen better days and there was a slightly odd smell pervading the place. The road the apartments on seems to be a bit of a rat run for taxi's and the double glazing is clearly of the cheap variety. Internet connection was good and the young chap on concierge was very helpful however he was replaced by a female colleague on the second day whose description is best left as ""surly""! All in all not perfect and given the competition about, probably not likely to be revisited any time soon. My husband stayed at Marlin Apmts Canary South this week, arrived to find the heating controls at 35 degrees and so was ridiculously hot. Woke the following morning to find the bed full of bed bugs..........how absolutely disgusting. He killed about 10 and they were full of blood..........presumably his. The bugs were all over the pillows, bedlinen and headboard. He was really angry and upset by this. We have travelled the world extensively and never...never....seen bed bugs. To make matters worse, no interest was taken by his complaint when checking out (very early) next day. Having now researched bed bugs, I realise how difficult to get rid of and so after bathing extensively when he got home late the following night, the next morning we have had to wash and clean all our bedding at home, discarded some of his clothes and left the rest and luggage he was travelling with, in the garage hoping the freezing temperatures will kill off any that had sneaked into his bags etc. How disgusting, we suggest you avoid this place like the plague. Please, How on earth people can moan about such a nice place is beyond me. Me and my friends arrived to the apartments late on a friday night, absolutely top class service by all the apartment staff. We were so impressed by the apartment, we did actually think there was a mistake, bearing in mind we are in london. Personally, im used to paying far, far more per night for a room in a claustraphobic hotel room, this was AMAZING! The room was warm when we arrived, but there it was more than easy enough to turn the heating down and open the balcony window for half hour to cool down, why, why, why moan? Ungrateful comes to mind! Anyway, for anybody who reads the absolute nonsense bad reviews on this place, take my word, this place is AWESOME! However, If your an ungrateful, snobby, pompous idiot then dont bother as you lot will ALWAYS find something to moan about! Wanted somewhere somewhere nice and close to where I was working for a few a days in London without the hassle of a hotel so when I browsed the internet I found a great deal through Marlin apartments. Booked a one bedroomed in Canary Wharf. Loved everything about the apartment, immaculate, wonderfully furnished, really comfortable and fab welcome pack of goodies! Apartments are very secure with everything to hand. Best nights sleep for ages. Definitely will stay in Marlin apartments in preference to London hotels and will recommend to all our friends. Misinformed by email concerning need for lockbox code to be forwarded by follow-up email which never arrived. In fact that system had been superseded and a concierge was in place but we only found out the hard way, arriving in London to find no email with code info. Had to go to another Marlin property (with concierge) to get into this property. Had to switch apartments due to unusable cooktop. First apartment had very stained carpet, second apt. had loose tiles in bathroom floor, chipped cooktop, large tear in sofa. Beds average. Overall good apartments but must attend to maintenance issues. Expensive per night in July but typical for London.",,,

Such a charming place. The hotel is a few minutes away from the subway and a Velib station. Has comfortable beds, delicious hot water in the bathtub and a gentle staff. Totally recomend it :-) Clean rooms, near trains station (Termini) and the subway. A few minutes away from the Coliseum. Staff a little rude, though.","Wow. Loved this place. Five minute walk from the main train station (Santa Lucia) down a tiny little alley way. So picturesque, so Venetian! All the staff were very kind (even when we couldn't communicate, we somehow seemed to figure everything out) and helpful. The owner (I think) spoke very good English and was very nice. Our rooms were clean and lovely. I would recommend this hotel to everyone! Plus, the windows look out on the picturesque alleyway with lovely wooden shutters, stone walkways, etc. We want to go back there already! Seems to be a family owned hotel - small and cozy. Staff was extremely friendly - allowed for us to keep our luggage there even after checking out and they even let us borrow an umbrella for the surprising rain that morning! The only problem is that the walls are extremely thin. Clean and big rooms, great breakfast for just Ã¢âÂ¬ 5 per person. (breads, croissants, milk, coffee, tea and juice) extremely confortable. Totally recommend it. We stayed in Venice at the end of September in what felt like unseasonably hot weather. The hotel was fine and seemed clean but the service was basic and my husband and I were rather caught out on the first few nights by the mosquitos that came to feast on us. Wifi was available but only in the lobby which was disappointing and there could have been more information - we weren't told about breakfast at check in so assumed there wouldn't be any! The breakfast was fine. Service was prompt but lacked warmth. A real plus for the hotel was the location close to the train and bus station (only a short walk over the modern bridge from the bus station) which was preferable to trying to get luggage on the vaporetto! However, the path down to the hotel was being worked on when we visited and there were a few choice smells emanating from beneath the ply board covering the work! I would definitely recommend the Hotel Caprera. (We stayed for 3 nights in March in a double room on the third floor). Our room was clean, tastefully decorated (modern, not chintzy), warm and light. The location is perfect as a 10 min walk from the bus station and a 4 min walk from the main water taxi station. The owners are lovely people who obviously take great pride in running a good hotel. It was great, we loved it, would definitely stay there again. If you do stay in this area, there are several lovely restaurants on the Rio Della Misericordia (including the excellent Paradiso perduto) and La Cantina on Strada Nova is well worth a visit. Fantastic service by staff at all times The room we had was spacious and spotless - the beds were not the most modern kind but we had lovely, fresh sheets daily Breakfast was modest but enough : coffee, juice, cake, rolls, cheese, ceral, etc served in the pleasant reception area The location is a 5 min walk from the car park entrance to Venice - very helpful for luggage but not in the centre of town. This will also save stiff ferry tickets there and back We were very happy with the room and service - the price was fair and I would certainly stay there again!! One of the cheapest options available for net booking, in this EXPENSIVE city of Venice on the lagoon/ islands itself. All the other cheap options or even multinational brands (except Hilton) are on the mainland like Mestre, treviso or the airport. Since the charm of Venice is the location itself, this is a reasonable choice with walking distance from train station and almost also the bus station (Piazzale Roma) and yet walk to the canals! Despite the location in the lagoon itself not being central, and the hotel itself being on a tiny sidestreet (look hard at every alley on your left while going from the station end of lista di spagna). Very close to the jewish ghetto - which is actually a charming and different area to stroll around in. Also close to the vaporetti (water buses) stops and the cheapest souvenir shops in Venice - including one for paintings and tapestries. Hoever the friendly staff more than make up for the rather dingy appearance and despite the dodgy windows with locks (!) it is rather a safe locality. Internet for free, a sparse but adequate european style cold breakfast and help with maps etc was an additional plus. However in this beautiful city nicer to stay ON a canal with a room with a view to die for, and save up budgeting for the rest of the world!! This is a delightful quiet small hotel located close to the train station. Our room on the top floor was large, spotless, well-appointed. Bathroom the same. WiFI in our room. Breakfast was very good. The Bico family were most accommodating when we were stuck in Venice because of the Iceland volcanic cloud. They recommended an excellent travel agency close by in the Ghetto, Magic Touch Travel Service, where Igor Korman made excellent suggestions. Easy to walk anywhere you want to go. Highly recommended at very reasonable rate for Venice! The hotel is located at a walking distance from the venice main train station - Santa Lucia, which is the city center. I took a single room. The rooms are of very small size. There is hardly any space in the room left after the bed and the chair in the room. All the rooms in this hotel have attached bathroom. You have the option of talking the room with breakfast and without breakfast. The family managing the hotel are very warm and friendly. They also provide free services like internet, room to keep your luggage after the checkout etc. Looking at the prices of other hotels in venice and also the location of the hotel, I will definately be staying in this hotel on my future visits as well. I would recommend this hotel on the basis of it location, attached bathroom, nice family managing the hotel and the prices of other hotel in venice (other hotels are expensive).",,,
moonstone0005,268405,"We stayed at the Welk Resort in Branson Missouri in late April 2012. The room was pretty standard. The people at the front desk were pleasant. The water park, a ""Splashatorium"" was a lot of fun. We went to the water park when it opened at 10 am. There was no one there but the attendant, who was very nice. She turned on the waterslide and showed us both the indoor and outdoor hot tubs. The indoor pool is warm and very pleasant to float in. My husband who is 65 years old went down the waterslide several times and really enjoyed it. Just a nice morning at the pool. There were lots of seats around the pool. There were plenty of towels to dry off with, and nice rooms to change into our swimming suits. The outdoor pool was not open yet. The pool started getting several people about noon. There was also a miniature golf course available on the other side of the hotel. We liked the Stone Castle because the staff was friendly and helpful. The non smoking room did not smell of previous smokers. The location is easy to find and close to Highway 76, the main highway where the shows and restaurants are located. The hot breakfast was tasty, and there was a good selection available. The live entertainment during breakfast was enjoyable. The parking lot was large and almost level which in Branson is rare, as many parking lots are on a hill side. This hotel is located on a side road that parallels the very busy Highway 76, so you can travel side roads to get to the music shows much quicker than on Highway 76. The hotel is south of Highway 76. We spent two nights at Lodge at the Falls in Branson, Mo. The room was clean. The hotel workers were friendly and helpful. Flat parking which is hard to find in Branson was good. Breakfast is provided by the hotel included cereals, white gravy and biscuits, coffee, hot chocolate, donuts, toast and jelly, bagels with cream cheese, muffins, hot tea, and juice. There was a swimming pool, but we did not use it. There was plenty of seating outside and inside for breakfast. The hotel is easily accessible off of 165 which takes you to the main road which is Highway 76 (The Strip). We stayed two nights. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel lobby, hallways, and rooms were clean and in good state of maintenance. The sleep number beds were very comfortable. We requested a non smoking room and there was no smell of smoke in the room. Location is close to Highway 76, the main thoroughfare of Branson, and easy to find. There is a back road out of the parking lot, if you are in a hurry and want to avoid the heavy traffic on Highway 76. It is within walking distance of some shows, including the Andy Williams Theatre. The parking lot is well maintained, but most of it is on a hillside. Motorcycle and handicap parking are close to the lobby entrance, and flat or level. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but there are restaurants within walking distance. We stayed at Branson's Best Hotel two days on a Thursday and a Friday evening. The room was clean and well appointed. The bed was comfortable. When we arrived there was only one room available for Thursday night, but we asked to be put on a waiting list for Friday night in case someone cancelled, which they did. The people running the hotel were kind and very helpful, and so were the housekeepers. After we got back from the show we enjoyed two kinds of hot cobbler (peach and blackberry), vanilla ice cream, coffee, cappucinno, and four kinds of freshly baked cookies. The food was very good. I'm glad we didn't have to go to a restaurant for a snack. The next morning at breakfast at the hotel they offered a hot bar with scrambled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy. They also had a waffle maker, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, bread for toast, yougurt, sliced peaches, and five kinds of cereal.There was also iced tea, ice water, milk, coffee, and cappuccino available. The food was very good. The cost of the food is included in the cost of the hotel room. It was nice to enjoy breakfast at our hotel rather than drive to a restaurant. The hotel has a pool but we did not use it. The hotel has three floors and there is an elevator available. Parking is very good and mostly level. The hotel sits on a road south and parallel to the main highway so it is easy to get into and out of. We will return to this hotel if rooms are available.","We spent two nights at Lodge at the Falls in Branson, Mo. The room was clean. The hotel workers were friendly and helpful.

The hotel is easily accessible off of 165 which takes you to the main road which is Highway 76 (The Strip). Just returned from Branson where The Lodge of the Falls was not our choice but was booked through a time share program. The front desk was friendly and even helped booking show tickets for us. The room furniture and tv was old but clean or so I thought. The rug had stains so I wore white socks(not white for long). The first night our bed did not have a mattress pad on it but the 2nd night we noticed the maid put one on. The refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker was nice. The safe did not work. Glad I did not have anything of value to keep safe. The breakfast was starch and more starch. Biscuits and gravy, variety of breads, frozen waffles, cake donuts, hot and cold cereals, orange juice, and coffee. Brought our own fruit to eat for breakfast. There was hot coffee in the lobby at all times-very nice. Did not use the pool as it was cool out. Did look nice though. The location was ok. There are so many more nicer hotels in Branson to pick from so I don't think I will be back. Room was a nice size, clean and convenient with the refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer, and safe. Also close enough to the strip to be able to get everywhere we needed to be within minutes but without the bumper-to-bumper traffic! For a continental breakfast I thought the selection was great. It even included hot biscuits & gravy. If I had to list a negative, I would say the bed was not as soft as what I am used to at home, but after going & doing all day in Branson, I crashed & didn't even feel the difference when sleeping! If you are just looking for a clean place to lay your head at night, this is it. Decor is old, could use some updating. But it is clean and simple. Staff was very helpful, even helped when we were trying to pick a show to see, they can get tickets that are slighly discounted. This hotel is close to the action (yet just enought of a drive).. There is a Sonic very close. Very good continental breakfast - good biscuits and gravy, but other than that it was a basic continental breakfast. Small but appreciated! This hotel was great for the limited amount of time we spent in our room. It was clean, convenient to everything but not on the busy strip, and very affordable. My son loved the popcorn machine in the lobby. We weren't overly impressed by the breakfast, but that was ok because the sonic was next door. I would stay here again, especially if the price stays low. Okay, it is possible that after reading the other reviews on TA I was expecting a bit more, but for the price one really cannot complain much. The place was quiet, plenty of parking, the rooms were a decent size, with the beds and pillows better than most economy places I have stayed. The kids loved the cookies and popcorn available in the lobby. We did have a bit of trouble when making our reservations. What happened was my husband had heard an ad on local radio saying if you mentioned the ad when you called the motel you got such and such a rate. Well, when he called the motel they didn't know anything about the ad and wouldn't give him that rate. My husband called the radio station and talked to the advertising dept., luckily he got the gal who had dealt directly with the motel on the ad, and she called the motel for him and got it straightened out. It seemed kind of silly that they wouldn't believe him as it was the same rate people have gotten through Priceline. As for their advertised breakfast, the gravy is a very bland, plain white gravy mix; however, the biscuits are very nice, but they did run low on them both mornings we were there, and we were there early. There were always plenty of the yummy donuts though. I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer hard boiled eggs, which seem to be available on a lot of complimentary breakfasts these days. Also, the breakfast staff did not seem to speak English and was rather remiss in refilling things such as coffee creamer, sweetener, and cream cheese. I noticed a few people asking for things and they were pretty much ignored. One particular incident I saw was a guy showing the lady in charge of breakfast that they were out of biscuits and instead of her letting him know there weren't anymore she just turned and walked into the room they kept the food in. He stood there for a bit thinking she was coming back with more. Would I stay there again? Possibly, but with all the deals offered on rooms in Branson it is unlikely I would seek this one out specifically. We stayed here a few years ago when it was Travelodge and it was a good deal. It's still a bargain but it seems a few small details are missed here and there. The air unit in our room was noisy sometimes and the lamp did not work (not the bulb, tried that). The vaccum cleaner needs to get a little closer to the walls and bed. Don't get me wrong, it's not nasty at all and I would stay here again. We did come in right behind a large tour group so the staff may have been rushed a bit. The fridge and microwave are a nice addition. Real quick review of this hotel. Only stayed one night but for $49 on Priceline this place was perfect. Rooms have been painted and renovated. Mattress and linens are brand new. Bathroom was spotless. Location is great unless U want to walk to the tourist traps on 76. Pool is small but well maintained. Check in and out went well. Only thing the morning breakfast is nothing special but is U need more, walk to Sonic across the street. if only they updated the comforters/bedding, this place would be pretty near perfection. it was clean and located in a quiet spot away from the strip. the pool was fantastic and it is always nice saving $ by eating breakfast locally. we'll stay there again for sure. Booked through expedia and couldn't beat the price, especially with free breakfast, free parking, and free wifi! The guy at the front desk was really gross tho, really overweight and had nasty silver teeth! He kinda turned me off from the get go all trying to crack jokes with me, but after check in everything was great. Nice pool and we were actually the only ones in it during the day (most people got in the late afternoon/evening. Breakfast was good enough- bagels, english muffins, waffles, cereal, biscuts and gravy. Very convienent to HWY 165 and really close to Danna's BBQ, which I would highly recommend! Their BBQ nachos were awesome! We also went to Shanghai Circus right up the road, and it was great too!",,,

For an overnight between flights, we shall definitely return. Stayed on our way back from trip to California. Daughter wanted to see Seattle the next morn. before going home to B.C. Had the dog with us so we decided to stay at the La Quinta. This was on Jan 1, 2012. The girl at the front desk was very nice. New at hotel traveling with a dog. Was happy to learn they did not charge extra for our 6 mo old pup. Charged $25 or more other places. The price was right but it is true the place is pretty run down. Needs new carpet especially in the halls. Windows real dirty could hardly see the airport. Bad lighting in the rooms. Standard breakfast. The area to let your dog go was covenient and there was bags provided. Come on people pick up after your dogs! I have to say though one reason might be that they put the pags as far away from the doors as possible and you have to walk across the grass to get one. Meanwhile trying to walk through the grass at night and stepping in stuff that others didn't bother to clean up after their dogs. might help to move the bags closer? Would only stay again because I had my dog and if the price was right. Found the La Quinta to be clean, the location very convenient, the staff helpful, and our room to be a good value for the cost. We will definitely stay there again. After staying at this hotel for two nights (up arrival for vacation and before departure) I am amazed that it has gotten such good reviews. The hotel is rundown and when we were there the staff at the desk was very disorganized. The bathtub in both rooms but particularly the first one looked so dirty that I did not want to step in it with my bare feet. My husband was ill and when I explained to the desk clerk that we needed to be picked up as soon as possible from the train - she was less than helpful. The most courteous and helpful person was the shuttle driver who went out of her way to be of assistance. Additionally, I have no problem that this hotel allows pets (I have my own) but while in the lobby a guest came in with her dogs (2) one peed on the carpet and while the woman did attempt to clean it up with a paper towel- nothing was done by the staff to make sure it was thoroughly cleaned up., Excellent stay. Quiet and a wonderful bed. Great location. Went to 13 Coins for dinner, very disappointed. Don't waste your money. The young lady at the front desk sent me 3 miles to a liquor store when there was one next door I could have walked to. The staff should know better than that, I think. Hit Dave's Dinner across the street for a great breakfast or a cocktail. Reviews of this property indicated this would be a place to meet our needs on the evening before flying out of SEATAC. Airport noise was not a problem, even though we were close; boarding passes could be printed from the hotel's lobby computer; breakfast was appreciated; parking was free; returning a rental car at the airport was easy. People at the front desk were friendly and helpful, and offered several suggestions for restaurants that were within walking distance. Our room was very neat, clean, comfortable, and quiet. Requesting a room away from smoking areas of the hotel is important, based on other reviews. Special pricing is available through AARP. We would definitely choose this hotel another time, if we were in the area. The rooms here are very clean and comfortable. The staff is incredibly good, very friendly and helpful. We really got a warm feeling from staying here even though it was only one night. The only drawbacks were that it was a little bit expensive and the rooms were a little on the small side. Also, the breakfast in the morning was not as expansive as it could have been. I think it is kind of an older property also. Besides that, I can definitely recommend this hotel for a night or two considering the very good staff and the rooms are comfortable and clean. For a longer stay you might want to find a place with larger rooms though. This hotel was great in regards me having my two large dogs. They have a great area for dogs and were able to assist me in getting us to the airport on time. They were very accommodating. Spent the night with girlfriends. We are traveling from Alaska to Florida. Seattle is a stopover. We got neighboring rooms. The shuttle was timely. The price was right. I had a restful sleep. Staff was great. A special thank you to Marcia the van driver. She was so helpful in answering all of our questions. The room was comfortable and spacious. I did a black light inspection of the room and as with most hotels, there were visible urine stains on the front ot the toilet. People just can't seem to hit that big open toilet!! The front desk staff gave us a good recommendation for dinner. While there, we met two other people from our home town of Juneau, Alaska. And it turns out that they were also staying at La Quinta. This morning my wakeup call was on time. The morning crowd at the breakfast was quite happy and chatty. There is a dog show and La Quinta does allow pets. In the shower,there was plenty of water pressure and lots of hot water. The bar soap was luxurious. It must be some kind of castile soap as it was so sudsy and felt like silk. It is the small things that matter. Overall, I would give this hotel an A. Price was right, location was close to the airport, shuttle was timely, room was clean, bed was perfect, shower was hot. I'll be back. We stayed at LaQuinta Sea-Tac for one night as a layover hotel travelng to Mexico. They picked us up at the airport. Then took us to the light rail station to catch the train to Seattle Center. We we got back to station, we called and they came right over and picked us up. The rooms are clean and very comfortable beds. They knew we would leave before breakfast so they got out muffins, coffee and juice for us at 4:30am before taking us to airport. I am a picky traveler and this met all our needs. I would stay again, I chose this hotel from TripAdvisor reviews. If you book ahead you can get good discount rate. Our friends were a day behind us and stayed at same hotel. They are very picky also and we glad I had recommended. Lighting was great, typical La Quinta layout and furnishings. Bedding comfortable, windows open for fresh air which I appreciate. A little on the chintzy side for amenties: not a lot of TV channels (in Seattle??) 1 coffee and 1 condiment packet, 1 shampoo and 2 little soaps. I had to hunt for a complimentary newspaper and there were only 2 left at the front desk at 7:15am. I'm an upper level Rewards member and only perk was express check-in. Breakfast ok, nothing to write home about, and no evening cookies like some LaQ's have. At check-in, front desk offered no information about facility amenities, breakfast, anything. Had I been told there was a restaurant, I might have ordered room service. Instead I walked across the lot to the Jack in the Box. Business center monitor/screen filthy. Nice size room w/fridge (which was leaking inside) and a microwave. Great shower/water flow. Reasonably quiet for being that close to the airport and I believe they offer an airport shuttle and there are a few other restaurants in walking distance. Friendly staff and a convenient location for SeaTac airport will bring me back. The desk staff was welcoming and helpful. Not only did they help with dinner directions, but they also offered to call the shuttle because it was raining. We needed a handicap room and were wowed by the design making access very easy for wheelchair users. The room was clean and quiet even though it is so close to the airport. The breakfast area was kept stocked and clean by a friendly lady with the usual waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals. With many restaurants, gas stations and rental car return lots within a few blocks, we were able to make a quick smooth exit after out travels to return home. The pillows at this location are lumpy and have no support. Terrible on the neck. They advertise High Speed Internet, but after 5 speed tests with Tech Support, it never even got close to High Speed - 64KB. I'm finding the bad pillows and the slow internet at many La Quinta locations. This chain have been one of my favorites for 17 years, but it's time to move on. The quality has greatly decreased. The bed was very uncomfortable, television was at least 10 years old, and it was priced a bit high for what I got",,,

There is a Ruby Tuesday nearby, we dined there, food was good. Free parking, close to I-95, clean rooms. Our room did not have any weird smell or bed bugs as some people alluded to. Pretty good value if you're need a place to stay outside of downtown Philly. My only complaint is that the staff didn't seem too caring. Their attitude was ""whatever"". We only stayed 1 night so I can't say what it is like to stay there more long term for business and such. Although the bathroom was clean and the staff at the desk pleasant, our room was filthy. The inside of the bedspread was visibly spoiled and blood stained. It clearly had not been cleaned. The box springs which were visible were equally filthy and stained. I was afraid to look at the mattress. The pillows were barely usable. I left for the airport a couple of hours early just to get out of the place. The floors and elevator had not been cleaned. There is no airport shuttle.",,,
Alvin W,85039,"We stayed on the 10th floor at the Parc Soleil for 4 days,and we certainly enjoyed our stay. The entire staff, including housekeeping was great. It was secluded, but just enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Shopping area and resturants were very convient. Seaworld was just minutes away. The resort had music floating through the air, which provided an enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere that complimented the landscaping and all the amenities. However the 2 hour timeshare presentation turned into 3.5 hours and a no thank you. We lost about 2 hours of sleep because the compressor on the furnance malfunctioned. We called for maintenance, and he promptly arrived. He was very nice and apologetic,but said he had heard some even louder than that one.

In March 2012, sensor flush would not work, engineer was quick to attend to the problem, and allowed us to use the toilet in another room. Maybe I'm just unlucky? But other than that, everything about the hotel is excellent. Friendly, helpful and attentive staff. Clean public area and hotel room. 24/7 in room service. Great selection of pillows. Comfortable bed, good ambient lighting. And best of all, the location. It's right in the shopping district and very close to monorail station. Highly recommended.

Well needless to say we found Bed bugs in one of the rooms and we asked to be moved only to be told that they we completely booked up. We showed the front agent one of the bugs we killed and they acted as though they could careless. They refunded the room with the bed bugs and expected all 8 of us to share one room. That wasnt going to happen, I have sense made a complaint with Choice Hotels and the GM stated that they didnt have bugs in the room. If you look at the picture you tell me what it is...","Let me start with the one positive thing, the staff. Everyone was freindly. It goes down hill from there. The rooms smell bad and we stayed in non smoking rooms. They are dirty. Look behind the night table and you will find built up dust and old papers. And yes there are bugs! We found a type of roach right on the night stand! Gross! So, that's the room. The property is right on a busy roadway so you can expect road noise but this place was beyond noisy! They need to put up trees or some other barrier to tone it down! Finally there was a guest staying there that was allowed to walk around the grounds shouting, talk to himself loudly, throw drinks around the hallway etc. The police had to be called. It did not feel like I was in an upscale community at all. And to think I paid $130.00 a night!!! Never, Never AGAIN! Gross!

I was glad to find this hotel in South Miami, along the busy Route 1 and stayed for 2 nights in February 2012. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, as were the cleaning staff. The pool area is the real highlight - I lounged around the pool and sundeck for 2 days and had a peaceful rest before travelling back to Germany. Breakfast from 7-10:00 was terrific to just grab a newspaper and have a nice long leisurely breakfast. All in all a terrific stay. Sadly, I can confirm that there are roaches in the rooms at this property. I killed one in the bathroom upon my arrival and my daughter killed one later. It is an older property so once it gets infested, I'm sure it would be hard to totally get rid of the nasty bugs. The beds were so so. The shower was fine. We were there for only one night and just made certain that we left our bags out in the car so we didn't bring any unwanted guests home with us. The checkin and checkout went very well and the staff were very friendly. We did not utilize the pool. I would likely not stay here again. I had to stay here for a night after emergency car trouble left me stuck in this part of Miami. They accommodated me right away and the people at the front desk were lovely. The property looks dated, but kept up very well. The room was clean and quiet. The free breakfast was pretty good as far as continental breakfasts go (lots of bread choices, fruit, yogurt, eggs, sausages, juice, coffee, tea). The pool area is big and clean with lots of comfortable seats. I had a problem with a charge on my credit card (my bank's fault, not theirs) and they were very helpful. I would stay here again. We made these reservation 6 months ahead of time .. our travel took us late and we checked in around 9pm,,,, We had called and told them that we were coming in late but we were given ""pet room "" which smelled like a pet room and had stains on the carpet ... The hotel had much nicer rooms .. I feel that this was one of the last rooms left ... From now on .. if we have reservation and we are running late with check in time .. We will call and tell them that we dont want a Pet room .. The pool was nice , the breakfast was good all was good but we were penalized for coming in late We hadn't planned on staying in this part of Miami during our vacation, but found it necessary for a few days and I'm glad we stayed here. This property may have originally a Holiday Inn from the 1960's, but it has been refurbished to a comfortable and affordable Quality Inn. The pool is large and heated and the hot continental breakfast was delicious and filling. Nice comfy bed mattresses and new pillows. The only issue we had was the continuous traffic noise from US 1, the ONLY route to the Keys -- our room was along a wing close to the road. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous during our time of need. Be sure to check out the mall down the street (The Falls), an open-air mall with continuous built-in waterfalls along the midway! What a great place to stay , really friendly helpful staff , very clean, lovely warm clean pool , poolside towels too! great eatery's closeby . Good lots of choice breakfast -was only supposed to be continental but scrambled egg bacon and sausage were always on offer as well as cereal fruit yoghurt and bagels muffins etc . very impressed . Very relaxing place with many amenities you would expect from a much more expensive hotel . Would always reccomend to anyone . Great value for money . I stayed at this property for a last minute business trip. I was a late arrival and not sure what to expect. As a former Choice Hotel employee, M.O.D. and Night Auditor, I tend to be very aware of how things should be done in a property, and can be somewhat critical. These folks got it right in ever area. The night Manager was very friendly, efficient, and helpful. Check-in was flawless. This is an older property, and as such could have presented challenges, however, their attention to the things that really matter overcame any issues that could have been a problem. Beds were very comfortable and I slept quiute well. When I called in the AM and asked for a late checkout, the MOD was gracious, and only too glad to accomodate. The Cleanliness of the room in general, carpet, smell, and A/C were great. The beds were made up with military precision, crisp, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was hospital-clean, and the shower was awesome. I was greeted by the Houskeeping Supervisor as I was preparing to check out, and she was also very professional and asked me if everything was okay. Finally, as I checked out and turned in my keys, The Guest Service Rep was so nice and courteous, I will definitely come back to this property anytime I need to be anywhere in or near Miami. This Hotel is in South Miami, on US1, in a really nice area of shops and restaurants, very close to 95 and airport, I could get right downtown in less than 15 minutes. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. My husband and I have stayed at this hotel twice during Art Basel. The rooms were very clean, the pool area is nice, and the staff was very helpful/friendly. This is not a fancy luxury hotel, but it is a clean, safe, and comfortable place to stay. I stayed there for four nights. I walked away with a kind of underwhelmed feeling. Their continental breakfast is... okay. I wasn't terribly impressed with the options - and the yogurt that they had on offer was due to expire the next day, and consequently tasted a bit strange. On the third night I discovered a bug in bed. Not a cockroach but some other kind of winged bug that was promptly evicted - didn't see any others. The showerhead in my room leaked all over the floor, and you had to crank the knob almost all the way around into the ""cold"" again just to get any hot water at all, and it didn't last long. The vending machines that they have on site for soda and snacks didn't have much of a variety of offerings, and about half of THOSE were sold out the entire time I was there. Of the 3 ice machines I had access to, 1 was broken the entire time, and 1 broke after the second night. There was some snafu with the payment that we're still working to resolve (something about advance payments and how they're handled). For the good: the air conditioner worked, the pool was clean and seemed well maintained, the housekeepers were punctual about cleaning and very helpful when I needed items, even with the Do Not Disturb sign up.",,,
RexTsatsaroglou,237164,"Definitely the worst hotel/hostel during my entire visit to Spain. Staff was annoyingly grim and unfriendly, room in desperate need of refurbishment, lacked fridge, hairdryer, toiletry (but a tiny soap), A/C was only switched on after request and was switched off sometime during the night and remained switched off during most off the day, even though Madrid was going through a heat wave. After having previously stayed at two hotels/hostels of equivalent class and price in central Madrid, which were both excellent but unfortunately had no vacancies, Hotel Mexico was a huge disappointment. Best value for money accommodation I've ever had in Madrid. Located in a building at the end of the pedestrian shopping street Preciados, next to Metro station Santo Domingo, on the 2nd (reception, rooms) and 3rd floor (apartments). Black-and-white minimal design, comfortable modern rooms with bathroom, and the biggest plus: friendliest and most competent reception ever, that makes you feel at home. Only drawback: central A/C on 2nd floor seemed unable to cope with the heatwave of nearly 40 degrees that had hit Madrid.","Definitely the worst hotel/hostel during my entire visit to Spain.

Mexico is very convenient to El Prado Museum, the Reina Sofia, and Thyssen art museums, the Botanical Garden, and the Atocha train station. The yellow airport bus also makes an easy connection at the train station. Mexico was featured in the MTV travel guide a few years ago. We stayed two nights in early April to visit the museums after a week on Costa del Sol. The decorative theme is interesting, but not too overbearing. The staff was helpful and patient, and complied with reasonable requests (extra pillow). Our room was clean, if a little worn, and had some funky touches. (example: there was only one rubber plug in the bathroom, which did not fit the bathtub, sink, or bidet.) We did not use the attached parking garage, but were very relieved that the idiot who was honking at 5:00AM on a weekend morning was NOT an American tourist. The hotel has a good location close to the Prado, train station, botanical gardens and park. We walked to all the major sites without any issues. The rooms are small and basic but fine if you just want a place to sleep. The staff had excellent english and were helpful when asked for information. The use of the internet was useful and at 1 eure an hour very cheap. This is not a hotel we would have booked through choice, the volcano in Iceland made a stay in Madrid a necessity, but for a cheap room in a good location its fine.",,,

This is a third visit and the management manage to improve the hotel each time. On this visit a small gift od glace fruits in the room and coffe, tea bags were provided, both small but pleasurable innovations; as was the large LCD TV. Yes the rooms seem small, but if the bed is heaved up into the wall as designed, then they are cavernous. But above all, the addition of a small kitchen, a dining table and its positioning on what must be the quietest throughfare in Paris make for an excellent stay. It enables you to make a good pot of real coffee, and pop out to buy fresh break/croissants and start the day refreshed at your ouwn pace in your own room. Like wise if youv've had a good lunch and don't want to eat out at night, just pop across the raod to Galleries Lafayette Gourmet and grab a snack to eat in front of the TV. Highly recommended. I've been at Citadines with my husband and three kids ages 13, 11 and 5. We picked up a two bedroom apartment. It was a nice duplex with two bedroms and a sofa bed in the living room,with a functional and well equiped kitchen, one wc and one ""salle de bain"". My teenage boys loved that they could have more privacy than if we were in a hotel, and my little girl loved to have a ""house in Paris"" where we could have breakfast and dinner. I just would like to have more light on the living room, wich was a little bit dark.Some days the cleaning wasn't perfect but then I called the front desk and it was solved. The staff was very nice and helpful. It's very well located, we could go walking to many nice places. I stayed in this 'aparthotel' for 3 nights in August. I needed a centrally located hotel to spend a few days with my 2 sisters, one who lives in Bali and the other in Canada. We had booked a one bedroom apartment, which was clean and tidy, but very small - I slept on the sofa bed which was okay, but you had to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, so there was no privacy at all, and I thought it would be very cramped to have had 4 people (it was pretty cramped with just us 3 anyway). It is in a nice, quiet street and centrally located, with friendly staff. Overall, a bit disappointing and very pricey for what it is. I My wife and I stayed 8 nights with our teenage daughter in a one-bedroom. Nice to have 2 separate rooms. Internet wi-fi worked well (though the codes expired a couple of times during stay and had to be renewed). Business center by restaurant uses same codes and was able to print boarding pass for flight. East connection to airport CDG on Roissy bus just around the corner on Rue Scribe. (Though Roissbus did not stop in an hour--and this before strike actions held--wait at Terminal 2A on arrival, it worked well on the way back--taxi from CDG was about 55 Euros). Monoprix on street in front of hotel (toward La Madeleine), and another supermarket nearby as well. Laundry in basement (9 Euros). Didn't try hotel restaurant. The mini-kitchen was fine as was dishwasher. Difficult We stayed in Citadine Vendome for 2 nights in late May with our 1 year old baby and had a really good stay. We only stayed in hotels before in Paris so this was our first time in an apart hotel, we picked this Citadine due to its location and reviews that it as quiet. The hotel lobby and service was adequate, courteous, the apartment was plainly but comfortably furnished, with a small kitchen area. The good point was the kitchen was separate to the two bedrooms and not in the living room, so when our baby waarate toilet was clean and tastefully furnished, the bedrooms a bit small but actually compared to other places we stayed in Paris before they can be considered spacious. Our room was quiet, there is no traffic in the street but there is a cafe downstairs which we did not find too noisy, windows are well soundproofed. Our baby had 2 very peaceful sleeps thanks to quiet hotel, no banging doors, no traffic and good blackout blinds. For our purposes of separate bedrooms, quiet but central location and an adequate kitchen it was perfect, decor is bland but comfortable so no complaints. We did not use the hotel breakfast, it was 17euros p/p, and since there are so many great cafes out there and the weather was beautiful we chose to eat out.",,,
SeaBee77,315123,"This was the worst hotel ever! It was so scary that me and my husband did not sleep at all. There was only one other guest who looked like he was just out of prison. The sheets and towels were stained. Shower was so bad that we didn't even shower. There is a restaurant next door and all the noise and fried fish smell filled the room. But we couldn't keep the windows closed because it was extremely hot! There was one little television from the last century and it had two channels - barely. We ended up leaving around 4:00 am to wait at the airport instead. And paid 80 Euro per person for this. I am Turkish, and believe me, this is not acceptable. Not for this price. We stayed three nights at this hotel to attend a wedding. The decor was amazing. This hotel is from the Ottoman time and was kept in that style. Everything from chairs to drapes has the same authentic look. It is a very elegant and quiet hotel. However, it is about one hour driving distance from the city center.","Stayed here for a week. The first room was tiny and the ceiling sloped so much that at one end of the room it was 8 feet tall at the other end 5 feet. The bathroom was sizeable and well fitted out. The problem was twofold. The air conditioning was broken and the window opened onto the interior atrium which meant that there was no fresh outside air to help. The temperature in the room reached 28 degrees. I asked the staff at reception to fix it but they shrugged and said it was not a hot day and then they turned their backs on me and started to deal with another customer. I got their attention again and they said they would fix the day. Two sleepless nights later I asked to be moved to another room and they said they were full. I asked the evening reception if they had a spare room for a friend and was told they were only half full so no problem! after an email from my company they moved me to another room which was much better and had the sea-view. The bar is very expensive the food only average but breakfast was good and plentiful. There was a noisy party one night that went on late. It is also worth mentioning that the hotel is someway out of central Istanbul and not suitable for tourist sightseeing I would not go back here again. Excellent location on the Bosporus. Renovation from an authantic Ottoman minister' mansion (Fuat Pacha). Nice service, good restaurant. Wonderful to have a walk next to the sea. I can't imagine why anyone would want to stay here unless they had business at KoÃÂ§ University (which I did). Located in Sariyer district, it is 45-60 minutes from the airport and 30-45 minutes from the central districts of Taksim and Sultanahmet. However, it is the only hotel in the area and it's not bad. The rooms are tiny and lacking amenities, the walls are thin, and the staff has limited English. On the other hand, it is right on the Bosphorus so there are lovely views and walks nearby, and it's near a ferry terminal if you want a quick cruise up to the Black Sea coast. The service and breakfast were good, and sometimes it's nice to stay in a ""real neighborhood."" Got here and the internet wasn't working (ultimately they fixed it--but the first person they sent to my room was clueless--they had to reset the router). The room is small and 85% of it is taken up by the bed. Tap water not drinkable (which I knew) but you have to pay for bottled water so that you can brush your teeth. The refrigerator in the minibar is broken (so that I can't put my own sodas in). The attachment for the shower head--the part that holds the spray in place--is broken, so that you can only take a shower holding the spray. The breakfast was rather spare. Two children were running around the dining room screaming but neither the parents nor the staff paid any attention. The upsides: Internet finally working and the view of the Bosphorus is great. We stayed three nights at this hotel to attend a wedding. The decor was amazing. This hotel is from the Ottoman time and was kept in that style.

Jason W,601293,"Fantastic hotel in Vegas. Great location, great service, and very quiet. Was very nice to be able to escape the noise and glitz of the strip, yet be really close to everything when it was time to go out. World class establishment. We decided to stay here after checking up on TripAdvisor for our first visit to Venice. From the airport, we decided to get a water taxi (surely the only way to arrive in Venice!) which took us directly to the hotel, where we were greeted by the concierge and porter straight off our boat. Checkin was nice and simple, and we were given a map of Venice with a short introduction of some places woth visiting. Wow, what a beautiful hotel. The decor is impressive, especially the alcove on the 2nd floor! Our room was a junior suite overlooking the Grand Canal, superb. So lovely to watch canal life go by out the window first thing in the morning or last thing at night. The small hallway to our room was also decorated with little lights in the curved ceiling so it resembled a starry night! The room was well decorated and comfortable, no complaints! For our last night, we booked the rooftop jacuzzi for an hour, with a bottle of Prosecco. Really relaxing and worth it if you get a chance! Breakfast was nice, with a good selection, and you can eat on the terrace which overlooks the Grand Canal, great way to start the day. The location is superb, close to Rialto bridge, and San Marco. It is right next to the Ca'Rezzonico museum (a must-see!) and the Ca'Rezzonico vaporetto stop. This hotel is thoroughly recommended. Thank you so much to all the staff for making our first trip to Venice so wonderful, we will definitely stay here again on our next visit! We went to La Jolla for my wife's birthday and were basically down there to relax around the hotel. Imagine our surprise when we learned that to use the fitness center and pool, we'd have to pay an additional fee. On top of that there was a $20/night self-parking fee neither of which was messaged anywhere on Hyatt's sight when I booked the room. I specifically look for these types of hidden charges now. The room was old with a bit of refurbish. No coffee maker, no refrigerator, an average television. The bed was tough on my back and worse, they had put some kind of additional cushioning on under the fitted sheet which caused it to come undone and thus I was lying directly on the mattress by the middle of the night. There's nothing special about the location and we could have stayed at the nearby Radisson for half the price.

Used to be a nice hotel, but now it seems that they are so desperate to take your money no matter what. It had a free wifi Internet in the lobby and if you were using it at night time the low life security would rudely ask you that you can not sit in the lobby. When you would tell them that you are staying in the hotel and need to use the Internet, they would tell you to go to your room or go outside in the street. Now the stupid manager or owner just got rid of the free Internet all together. If you would bring a lady to your room, by the lobby they would make the girl or you HAVE TO BUY a stupid raffle ticket for their stupid new years disco party or their stupid restaurant. I repeat you have to buy this in order to take your girl upstaires. How desperate can you get as a hotel. I will not go to this hotel anymore even if they beg me! Extremely disappointed in their ways of thinking. Fantastic hotel in Vegas. Great location, great service, and very quiet. Was very nice to be able to escape the noise and glitz of the strip, yet be really close to everything when it was time to go out. World class establishment. Just spent a week staying at the San Pedro Inn on Gaffey. I dont normally have time for writing reviews but this hotel was a great stay, great value and felt really safe. The beds were crispy and clean, the bathroom were tidy and crispy. Our rooms smelt great and breakfast was big and long. We just spent 5 weeks in the US and stayed at some more expensive but far worse horror hotels in Long Beach and one in New Jersey. We loved the fact you could not hear the noise from the road out front and that the floors we stayed on were only accessible by security card and had no access from the outside world. The pool was not in use due to renovations which was a little disappointing but the beach was close by and this hotel is really handy to everything. I just hope when Best Western takes over the value stays. Location wise we did not know San Pedro but we now love it. 1 highway to LA central and close to everything, close by LA standards anyway. We plan to stay again as long as Best Western does not up the prices to suit the grandeur of the old school classy building. Felt like we were staying in Beverly Hills from inside.

The foyer's decor, lounge chairs and twilight ambiance are so inviting it is hard to walk past to your room without stopping. The staff - brilliant every time I stayed there. I agree the rooms are dated but they are very clean and the beds as good as any I have used. They are also quiet. I only stay in the room to sleep so they were adequate for my purposes. Over the last 10 years I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels in Sydney CBD for work commitments and short holidays. It was sheer luck I stumbled across the Old Sydney Holiday Inn a couple of years back and now it is the only place I will stay. If brand new bathrooms and amenities is more important to you than location and ambiance than it's not your hotel. Otherwise I can't recommend it enough.

Extremely disappointed in their ways of thinking. One night business stay. Close to Dubai airport, but a good distance from the main shopping centers. Unfortunately, my short stay was spoilt by two unplesant episodes. The maitre had a furious row with one of the waiters in the presence of a full dining area. This was embarassing not only for the poor waiter but also for those who were trying to enjoy their meals. The lack of social skill dispalyed by the waiters was reinforced by the reception staff. At the check out I had the unpleasant experience of the receptionist calling the floor to double check that nothing was taken form the minibar. This is routine only in hotels with poor customer care, surely they had my credit card on file... I was releaved to be informed that all was fine! In addition, when I questiioned why I was charged twice for the internet, connection I was told that I used both a cable and the wireless. I protested but my complaints were met by very poor customer skills, poor english and extreme rudeness. I had to pay the full ammount. I explained that this was unacceptable but it all fell on deaf ears. Never again. Dubai offers millions of cheaper hotels that provide better service. Dont be fooled by the glamour of the website, you wont certainly be treated like a Tzar! Strange hotel, we booked it as it was one of the only hotels left with rooms. We read the reviews about the prostitutes and the nightclub noise, but for us that didnt bother us, the noise would be welcome as we were there on work and needed to be up until 5am each day anyway. Surprisingly the rooms we had on the 5th and 7th floors which were directly above the nightclub were quiet! You could just hear the bass if you were near the window. The rooms were clean, quiet, the beds super comfy, and the air con was super cold! Yes the desk is a little strange and in my room there was no power outlet unless you unplugged the tv! The internet is really expensive, at AED99 per day, but it was fast. The hotel isnt for families, or bringing your wife (unless she is open minded), From about 5pm to 4am the lobby is full of prostitutes and men who look like they are out of a 1970's gangster movie. You will notice a bar on the left as you walk in, a cocktail lounge with a girl sitting at each table waiting for work. They didnt approach you, they just all looked creepy. The street outside is lined with working girls offering their wares at night too which is strange to see in Dubai. Great food, had the Borscht. It was like walking into a palace. Drinks were reasonable. This was a last minute booking due to a reservation being lost at another hotel. Availability in Dubai was poor for these dates, and the Moscow took advantage of this by charging me a rate that was extreme for this property. Once I arrived, it took over two hours to check in (the staff had a question about my reservation and made me wait while they checked in everyone else in the lobby). Finally I went back up, they had forgot about me and were rude when I reminded them I was there. The lobby was nice and the place had a unique look. The room was small, dingy, and had a bad smell. The porters were great, but rest of staff was inattentive and acted like they didn't care. They charged for internet service. At the price I paid, that was just a slap in the face. There was no wireless internet in the room and the Internet cable was too short to be able to use without placing the computer on the very edge of the desk. Twice I had no hot water. It was poor experience, and for the price I paid I could have stayed at the best of the 5 star resorts in Dubai. So this wasnt the first hotel I was supposed to stay at, but i couldnt remember the name of the hotel i had booked. So i got into a cab, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE UNIFORMED CABBIES, not the idiots in street clothes driving their own cars. This dude took me straight to this hotel, and at first I was like ""ok, this shouldnt be too bad."" Check in was easy and hassle free, took my bags to the room and i tipped the dude, very courteous on all accounts. THEN the phone rang! Other end was an obvious russian woman asking me if i wanted company. I politely said no thank you. But apparently this chick isnt you used to hearing no, because she copped serious attitude. Politely said no a 5TH time, and finally got the dial tone. Went to use the internet, and it advertises high speed internet. UMMM, yeah high speed means less than an hour for a website to load. Overall, the bedding and the room were nice. Old world russian, which was quite an experience. Didnt hear the nightclub very much, but sure did get a lot of offers on the way down to get something to drink. Anyways, long story short.....WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN! From the crooked cabbies making a BEE LINE for this hotel, to the ""working"" women calling on the phone, this place was horrid. IF you are a single dude and want some ""action"", go here, just make sure you wrap it! Good luck. Although the hotel is not very big but very well maintained. Any one interested to have Indian or Asian food, the restaurants are available on the opposite side of the main road near the over head bridge. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my Darling Angela and we really enjoyed a lot, it has the best Club in Dxb. and the service is wonderful but just the food is awful and not good and it was a very good experience for us and in winter we will came back for a vocation and i will directly came to Moscow Hotel. Reshad i traveled with my friends,when we saw the hotel it was so cool and nice..i approach one staff and ask were is the restroom she ignore us and say go find ourself WOW what and attitude, that's very disrespecful..i ask one time staff and she give me the name she was fides garcia shes pretty but her attitude like hell..i just wish you kick out that woman.. I was there for 4 nights and my opinion is : good staff , excellent discow , clean room , good coffee shop , best service , good restoorant and very good ladies . i have been in it for 5 days ,so awful foods ,bad view,not safe,services is awful.,the room has not enough light,plus that have to tolerate all the night the club's sound which u can hear to 4th floor in the hotel ,really not advice any one to stay in it. I stayed in this hotel only one night . The stuff was very welcoming . the hotel is very well decorated . But the egyptian waiters just dont fit there , those of the lobby were extremely slow and all the clients were complaining from them . I didnt like the fact that they make you pay a deposit at your check in saying that they will use it for mini bar or any extras provided during your stay . I was really mad when they make me pay fro my breakfast . I thought I had a BB . Even if I am not supposed to have breakfast they normally must mention this which they didnt . In the disco a filipino waitress deprived me of my table saying that it was reserved while there was nothing on it .......... I had a smokimg room but it was at first floor so i didnt sleep all night . I also didnt like the fact that even as a hotel resident you must pay to have access to disco and it was 100 AED . It s also worth mentioning that I changed the access card to my room 5 times . Whenever I go out , I find that the card doesnt open the door .",,,
Tyler L,2341542,"Me and a group of friends stayed almost a week for a convention in San Diego. there were always clean towels, everyone was always helpful, and they always had a good breakfast. The part I appreciate most was the last day we had to check out but we still had business at the ACS Convention Center so they held our bags until we had to come back and be picked up by the shuttle. although the hotel is located right in the middle of city centre, its REALLY hard to find and the sign of the hotel is REALLY small. and the reception is not in the same building, and same, very hard to find. there is NO air conditioning in the room and Madrid is like boiling when we were there. I couldnt sleep all night cuz it was too hot. and the floor was SO dirty. the shower is the only good thing in the room, sadly. we dont recommend this hotel at all.","Although it was an ensuite room we booked, it was all basic. No air-conditioning really was a problem since we went in the summer and it was super hot that my friends couldn't sleep, they woke up soaked in sweat...We had to keep the windows opened but then my friend worried about out safety during the night...The bathroom was small but the shower was good. There's a computer in the room, surprisingly. It's a granny computer but it works fine with internet (would rather swap it with an air conditioner though) Location was its selling point to us, within walking distance to the city center. As we walked down the main street - Gran Via, we saw many hotel on both sides of the streets, all looked very grand. So I suppose for we couldn't find a much better choice given we were in budget. One thing to note, the reception is about 30 seconds walk from the rooms, on a different street. Just look for the sign ""JC rooms"" (a small black board hanging out of the building right opposite to the street where the apartment is). although the hotel is located right in the middle of city centre, its REALLY hard to find and the sign of the hotel is REALLY small. and the reception is not in the same building, and same, very hard to find. there is NO air conditioning in the room and Madrid is like boiling when we were there. I couldnt sleep all night cuz it was too hot. and the floor was SO dirty. the shower is the only good thing in the room, sadly. we dont recommend this hotel at all. This hostel really gives you value for money. Stayed there for 2 nights, in a room with private bathroom. It was clean and comfortable and you even get some free drinks and yoghurts in the minibar upon arrival. The room is cleaned every day. The room is slightly small but that doesn't matter for those who are only in the room to sleep.. Perfect location; 2 minute walk from Puerta del Sol. Only negative point is that the walls are very thin so if people make some noise you will definitely hear it. I would definitely stay here again! 12 rooms is located 150 meters from El Sol central square. It is a good place for an overnight, clean , safe and value for money...so if you look just for a place to sleep this is a good choice.",,,
Alessandro B,305330,"The hotel is situated in a nice area of London (Zone 1) Earls Court. It's 3minutes walking from the underground station. The reception is just in front of the stairs. The man at the entrance is very kind and helpful, always smiling. The rooms are not so good, small and not well cleaned. The bathroom is very essential with the shower and a very small sink. There is a tv and hairdryer. The wifi is free. The breakfast is served in a very small room and served with just toast, jam and juice. The hotel is not comfy for business trips but it's ok for young people because it's cheap. On a trip last fall to London, I blindly chose the Posthouse Kensington from an internet site. It was a good choice. The rooms are predictably small (go for the double, even if you're traveling alone), but sufficient. The location was great for traveling on foot, by train, or bus. Get a transportation pass from while you're there, and you'll save a lot if you do much sight-seeing. I picked mine up at Heathrow for about $40 USD - one week, all access.","I strongly advise you to not choose this hotel as they are real robbers. They used my credit card after I canceled my reservation which they booked some rooms that is not according to my request and without giving me information of their policy. Their only aim is to charge you without any kind of service.They are never trustable; be careful. I just wrote here for you to know where you are going.

The hotel is not comfy for business trips but it's ok for young people because it's cheap. We stayed here from Dec. 22 to 27. Nice location accessible from Heathrow airport via the Picadilly Line and by Easy Bus from Gatwick but you either have to walk 10 to 15 minutes or 2 bus stops to the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast not bad. Aida, the one in charge of housekeeping and breakfast even offered to cook omelet eggs for us. The restaurant is being used just for breakfast but can also be used by guests if they want to eat food they bought outside although the rooms have small kitchen. Christmas Day is stand still in London, no transportation whatsover, we walked to Harrods for about 15 to 20 minutes and Hyde Park about 30 minutes.Not bad for a hotel classified as 2 or 3 star. Good location (50 m from Earl's Court station). I was expecting something like a hostel but it was lovely. The accommodation was very basic, but clean and adequate. Free wi-fi and good breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was the best hotel that I stayed in London, for this price. My friend and I decided to share a hotel room instead of staying in a hostel, and this hotel worked out at the same price. The location was perfect, handy for the underground and very safe and clean. Plenty of lovely restaurants, pubs, chemists and supermarkets. The room was clean and neat, everything you want, ketchenette. good breakfast. Reception staff were very polite too. I would definitely stay here again the staff was extremely rude unhelpful, the place was dirty. i went to Europe on a tight budget but trust me spend a little more and go some place else The room was small but the location was great. The people from the reception was really nice and kind. The breakfast is good and also you have free wifi we are resistant travellers :) and usually we expect a less than more ....So, this time :] we did not mistake; there were a very, very small room and a smaller bathroom (I strong recommend to scrap a bath and install a shower!), not for people over 160 cm and 55 kilos. However, good ideas are: a small kitchenette in the room, continental breakfast and available a free left-luggage after check-out. so small..but cute. great location 100 m. to subway supermarkets and fast food restauranst and a few pub surround. PLEASE TAKE THIS REVIEW AS A WARNING, EVERYONE This hotel is absolutely disgusting. It is filthy, everything is broken, room had 1) Rotten windows that wouldn't close 2) Broken fridge 3) Filthy Shower 4) Shower door held together with tape 5) Dirty bedding 6) Hadn't been hoovered for weeks PLEASE DO NOT BOOK HERE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I wish I had checked the place out first. It is a disgrace that there is accommodation like this in London. I travelled around many places in Europe this summer and this hotel was BY FAR the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. When we first arrived they required us to pay upfront and we didn't have any pounds on us since we had just come from Amsterdam. We stayed there for seven days and NOT ONCE was the bathroom ever cleaned. It was so disgusting that the bathroom door had to remain closed at all times. The hotel staff said that they cleaned it every day but it was obviously not. Every morning when we stepped outside of our room there were towels folded beside our door. I can't say with 100% certainty but I'm pretty sure that they were the towels given to us for the night. The toilet paper was never replaced and it took 3 me three times going down to reception requesting it before receiving one roll. The hotel staff were quite rude and not helpful at all in terms of recommendations, except for a restaurant that a friend of theirs owned nearby (which I didn't go to). Breakfast was also quite bad there is only ceral, bread, ham and cheese. Also, they don't have wifi only a usb that has internet. I can't remember how much it was as it was not worth it. My advice is to go to McDonalds near Earls Court station and use their free wifi. The only reason I booked this hotel was because of its kitchenette, which was the only good thing about this hotel. I will never stay at this hotel ever again and to anyone who reads the more positive reviews about this hotel should seriously think again. They may have said it was clean, but trust me when you look at the bed sheets and there are hairs everywhere and the bathroom smells like urine, its not clean at all. The reviews stating that it was not that bad must be blind or just plain ignorant.",,,
Balmoral99,734757,"We enjoyed our stay /Nov 10-14/11/ at Loews very much. It was close to everything - French Quarter, River walk, French Market. Rooms are very spacious and very quite, - extremely comfortable beds. We used indoor pool, sauna and Jacuzzis a couple of times. Nice relaxation in the middle of the day after lots of walking. And especially we liked a coffee maker - Keurig in our room!! As a coffee ""addicts"" we had this exceptional coffee very morning right in our room in our pajamas and white robes. I will recomend to evryone to choose this hotel when in NO. The hotel has a very nice rooftop terrace with a little swimming pool, location is perfect to see everything around, Piccaso Museum - just two steps from the hotel - must see. It was very enjoyable stay with my family. P.S. Buffet breakfast - very good.","Very nice hotel, friendly staff, close to all the central attractions in Barcelona - just 5 minutes of walking from Universitat or Placa Catalunya Metro stations. The rooms in modern style, with comfortable bed, safe and big shower. The hotel provides mineral water unlimitedly. Needs to be improved: no minibar in the room, and the assortment of food in breakfast (which is is poor, we've stayed 4 nights, each morning was the same food). But generally this is a strongly recommend hotel. Centrally located at 2 minutes walk to La Ramblas and the close to 2 metro stations, this was the ideal spot for a night in Barcelona prior to taking a cruise. In addition it is walking distance to the Colom monument at the end of La Ramblas where we took the shuttle bus to our ship...not taxi, no public transportation needed. The hotel is boutique style on a pedestrian street so is very quiet. Room was small but adequate and very clean. There was no window to the outside but a window onto a funnel in the middle of hotel leading to a skylight gave the illusion of outside light; very clever. The reception area is small and doubles as the breakfast nook in the mornings. Breakfast was basic self-serve continental however there were several pastry shops close by so we chose to go to one for coffee and fresh pastry. The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a fridge with free water in the lobby; a very nice touch. They provided small as well as large bottles. The hotel rooms carried a warning about potential scams while in Barcelona which proved to be prophetic for us in this city of petty crime aimed at tourists. At â¬129 per night (room only), this hotel was not cheap for off season but location was worth the extra money. We were able to get to the hotel by taking the airport bus to PlaÃ§a Universitat and walking from there. We would use this hotel again without hesitation. The hotel has a very nice rooftop terrace with a little swimming pool, location is perfect to see everything around, Piccaso Museum - just two steps from the hotel - must see. It was very enjoyable stay with my family. P.S. Buffet breakfast - very good. We went to Barcelona from 13/03 to 18/03/2011. When we arrived at the hotel, first impression of the neighbourhood was ""where the hell did they drop us"". The buildings are tagged with grafiti and looked desolate. Once inside the hotel, things were different. Very friendly staff, clean and, for a city, large rooms. Since the hotel is on a side street of the Ramblas, the noise was very limited. Breakfast is quite extensive: a selection of cheeses, cold cuts, cereals, yoghurt, ... nothing hot although. Internet is free: a computer stands at your disposal and bottles of water are also free (to be taken out of a fridge). Clean and cozy hotel, in a great location. Very helpful personnel. location is very good.hotel is very clean and staff is helpfull.hotel`s breakfast is poor and at room there isnt clocg.otherwise I recommend this hotel. I booked this hotel because it was central, fit my budget and the online reviews were good. It lived up to the reviews. The location was wonderful and the hotel itself was lovely. I would say, however, that I'd go for a double room next time. I had booked a single, which was small and had no outside window. It got a bit stuffy but if I opened the window to the interior courtyard, a lot of noise came in. My friends had a double, which was spacious and even had a small balcony -- for maybe 10 or 15 more Euros per night. They did comment that the walls were paper thin and they could hear every word that was said in the next room. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but there were any number of great options in the vicinity. It was the perfect place to base myself for my first trip to Barcelona -- on days when I felt like taking it easy, there was plenty to do in the immediate neighbourhood (like MACBA, the modern art gallery) and the hotel itself (like the roof terrace.) On other days, I could stroll down Las Ramblas to the port or venture further afield through the nearby metro stations very easily. The free wifi was also a bonus. Can't wait to get back to Barcelona and I definitely plan to stay at this hotel again. The hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Les Rambles and Placa Catalunya, the heart of Barcelona, where the Metro and many buses (all night buses) interchange. Rooms are not large but VERY clean and well equipped for a 3star-hotel. Staff always helpful. 24 hour reception. Water bottles free all the time, tea and coffee from 3p.m. Most rooms do not face the street so they are quiet. + great location - so close to La Rambla, Plaza Catalunya, the Metro, the Contemporary Art Museum + simple, clean, modern style + free water, free computer access, wi-fi + rooftop terrace for sunbathing, and jacuzzi + the staff are all so good-looking ;) and helpful. They were able to get us on the guest list at any of the nightclubs we wanted to go to. + great value + close to great restaurants and shopping The hotel Ciutat Vella has a great location, being a 2 min walk from the Rambla. Itâs a simple hotel, with the basics, but very clean. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Iâve read some reviews about thefts at this hotel, but we had no problem. The room had a safe, so you just need to be careful and put your belongings on the safe or on your luggage (if you can close with a code or padlock). We stayed in a quadruple room that was transformed in a twin room â not the most beautiful room in the world, but the beds are comfortable and the room and bathroom were always clean. Mainly, you get the basics of a hotel, not much luxury, but itâs ideal for those who want to walk around Barcelona and profit the most of the city, since itâs very central and you have the metro station of PlaÃ§a Catlunya at 3 min walking distance. This was not only a great value but a really great place. The rooms were simple but always clean. The staff was friendly and welcoming and gave plenty of good recommendations, especially for food. I ate at some wonderful restaurants that aren't listed in any of the guide books. They also have a giant fridge full of free bottles of water. This might sound unimportant, but it actually ended up being a really great feature. No need to go out to buy bottles of water if you don't want to drink the tap water in your room. If you're going to be out the entire day in the city or on a day trip you can get your water right at the hotel for free. A small thing but a really nice one. The location is perfect, right in the heart of the city. Overall a great experience.",,,
Charles D,626183,"Let's get the easy stuff out of the way-the hotel was clean, modern and appears to have been recently renovated. Great for vacation but not for business travelers. It was a $30 cab ride to the convention center (I thought it was much closer and they will tell you on the phone that it's a short cab ride). I checked in at night and the reception is not the hotel. You haveto go back outside to get to your room even for the tower. It's not well light and the signs were confusing. It's like your wandering around Jurasic Park. I finaly found the entrance to the tower. Now to find the bar...one of then is in the restuarant Red Marlin..a short hike through the jungle. My friend isnt there..he's in the pool bar..which also doesnt have an inside entrance. Back through the jungle. You can see the bar but you cant get to it. Now a locked gate (have to use your room key). Now the bar, but where's the door in all this glass. OK..now setttled. No soft drink machines on the floors, no coffee in the lobby. Breakfast is back at the Red Marlin..what??? OK..there's a Enstein Bagel shop..how do I get there? back through Jurasic Park..down the path..through the parking lot, Turn right up the path to the walkway.. Walk down 100 yards to the store. Get it?? I checked out heading for the Bayfront Hilton...everything's in one building..including the coffee. I chose Schlafmeile Hostel on the basis that it was the first entry on a quick and desperate computer search performed on HostelWorld after arriving at the Berlin bus station on the overnight coach from Amsterdam. It was cheap and close to the airport (Schonefeld) where I would eventually leave Berlin from. Travelling with a friend, we believed when booking that we would have to wait until after 2pm to check in. But when we arrived we were greeted enthusiastically and ushered straight into a room at 9.30 in the morning. After a nap in a comfortable bed we went in search of food and found an extensive menu at the bar of the hostel. The food was delicious and affordable and the service was excellent. The hostel is located in East Berlin but it is a simple city to navigate and you can get anywhere. The advantage of staying in this district is that it is very cheap. Even if you are seeking some serious nightlife this is an ideal place to stay because you can take advantage of the cheap drinks at the hostel bar (and in the supermarket across the road) and then take the train to elsewhere in the city. If you simply want a good night's sleep (which let's face it we all need after an honest night's drinking) then you will certainly find it here. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. The owner has a typical Kiwi love of life and was a great laugh. There is a common room where you can meet other guests, the hostel is clean, the showers hot and the coffee ready and waiting to counter the hangover in the morning. As a place to stay I can't speak highly enough of this place. I was there for three nights and never encountered any bed allocation problems at all. Some of the other guests did have to move rooms during the time I was there but they were long-term 'residents' and didn't mind this at all. All in all, I would strongly recommend this place to anyone staying in Berlin. Me and my fiancÃ©e stayed for five days in Paris and we were very pleased to stay in that hotel. ItÂ´s very well located, near stores, subway stations, restaurants and so on. Staff were wonderfull. Rooms were large, modern, well equiped and very clean. Breakfast was great. We have absolutely no complain at all about this hotel. Perfect. Let's get the easy stuff out of the way-the hotel was clean, modern and appears to have been recently renovated. Great for vacation but not for business travelers. It was a $30 cab ride to the convention center (I thought it was much closer and they will tell you on the phone that it's a short cab ride). I checked in at night and the reception is not the hotel. You haveto go back outside to get to your room even for the tower. It's not well light and the signs were confusing. It's like your wandering around Jurasic Park. I finaly found the entrance to the tower. Now to find the bar...one of then is in the restuarant Red Marlin..a short hike through the jungle. My friend isnt there..he's in the pool bar..which also doesnt have an inside entrance. Back through the jungle. You can see the bar but you cant get to it. Now a locked gate (have to use your room key). Now the bar, but where's the door in all this glass. OK..now setttled. No soft drink machines on the floors, no coffee in the lobby.

Furniture is quite old too. Breakfast was good and staff was very nice. The great advantage of this hotel is its location, near a good supermarket, shops, restaurants and tube station. Our room was oriented to the side street and has almost no noise at night, allowing us to sleep very well.","I chose Schlafmeile Hostel on the basis that it was the first entry on a quick and desperate computer search performed on HostelWorld after arriving at the Berlin bus station on the overnight coach from Amsterdam.

Some of the other guests did have to move rooms during the time I was there but they were long-term 'residents' and didn't mind this at all. All in all, I would strongly recommend this place to anyone staying in Berlin. I've been to Berlin five times (it's my favourite city) and I have always stayed at this hostel. Why? The prices are very reasonable, it's very close to the U+S Bahn (it's far from the centre but it's only 10 minutes by U-Bahn), it clean, comfortable, plus a great place to socialise in the common room and there are enough places to go out eating and drinking nearby. But, more importantly Glen (the owner) and his staff are so friendly and helpful. For example on my second visit, I had booked for four nights but there was a problem with my booking and was only booked for two nights. However, Glen got on the phone and sorted out the remaining two nights at the nearby AO Hostel (nice but not as good). I cannot visit Berlin again and not stay at this hostel, it's like a second home to me. Myself and 3 others visited Berlin for the weekend and stayed here as it was recommended to us by friends. We arrived just after midnight and luckily the kiwi restaurant next door was open so someone could let us in. Unfortunately our booking had been taken down wrong and they had us down to arrive the next night, but after very little fuss we were allocated a room (see photos). The rooms have a private entrance out onto the street so people can come and go as they please. As others have said there is a tram that runs past the hostel and that can be a bit noisy. Apart from that the hostel is very clean, has nice hot showers, good cooking facilities and a lounge with TV and free wi-fi to relax in. There's also fixed computers to log onto. Glen (the manager) was friendly and on hand to recommend where to go. There are plenty of places to eat in the local area and the U-bahn is about a 5 minute walk from the hostel which runs straight into Alexanderplatz. I would definitely recommend heading up the TV tower (you may wish to book online beforehand to avoid the queues). It allows you to get your bearings whilst taking in a great view of the whole city. Also head down to the Brandenburg gate and join one of the free walking tours. It lasts for 3-4 hours and you'll learn a lot. You only have to pay what you think the tour is worth. All in all Berlin is great city and you can do all the major touristy bits in a weekend. Further out of the the city is Potsdam which other travellers said was worth a visit. This was my first time in a hostel but based upon the experience I will definitely look at them as an option for travelling in the future. I stayed here a year ago with my friend on a clubbing/sightseeing holiday. The staff were very nice and the owner especially is really good at his job(such a funny guy). The beds were comfy, room was clean, nicely decorated and the bathroom was reasonably sized. The kitchen area was well equipped so we used this a lot to cook our own food. The social area is also good and never seemed to get overcrowded. It felt like someone had put a lot of effort into making the hostel nice.. i would definitely stay here again/recommend it. The subway isn't far (10 mins walking) and the area is mostly quiet with some cool shops around. Only stayed one night but seemed like a really nice place - there is a communal kitchen/common room which is great for meeting people and hanging out. Everything was very clean, the beds were comfy and the room was a good size and had lockable cupboards as well and lockable boxes for valuables. The bathrooms were also clean although there were only two showers which weren't separated from the rest of the bathroom so you had to hope there was no-one else in there when you got out of the shower! As we weren't there for long it's hard to know exactly about the location but heard from other travellers there was good nightlife nearby, and to be honest Berlin is so spread out you have to get the UBahn/SBahn everywhere anyway so where you are doesn't make too much difference. The hostel is less than 10 minutes from the UBahn so convenient in that sense. I would definitely stay here again!",,,
suetripper,183641,"My family had been coming to this classic court motel since 1973, but this trip will be our last. It really has fallen on bad times. What had been charming and a throwback is now just very worn. Locaiton on Kingsway is still convenient, but carpets and beds are shot, sheets thin. Rat trap behind stove in kitchenette. Cops patrolling parking lot every AM. Yet nothing downscale about price, even though I know Vancouver has gotten more spendy. Staff was helpful with directions and getting more pillows, but this is not a happy place. Nice that they try to have WiFi, but popular such as Facebook sites were blocked by network. Sad to see an institution lose its way like this. Visiting friends in the Shoreline area, so we didn't to be downtown. We don't require trendiness just cleanliness and convenience. This hotel on Aurora Ave fit the bill nicely. Nothing extraordinary, but a very good value, clean, a good breakfast, quiet and safe. One niggle was a hot tub that had new chemicals put in and nobody to make it usable. Visiting friends in the Shoreline area, so we didn't to be downtown.

Internet was a little slow but still did the job. The front desk was very helpful. Would have been nice to have been told about the 200 deposit when we booked but, plenty of space. If you are expecting perfect maybe not for you but if you are not then great place. would definately book again for group setting.

Has deteriorated, not kept up with the times. The best that can be said is that it is a good location, and relatively clean. Out of date now, needs extensive renovating. I am sure there are much better motels for the same price. Options for a place to stay for 5 or more people in one room are hard to find but the 2400 motel worked perfect for us. Our room had a living room and a seperate bedroom with 2 beds and room for a rollaway bed, 3 large closets and a good sized bathroom. There was a picnic table right out front of our unit and the lawn was well taken care of including lots of nice flowers and bushes. The units themselves are not fancy but are taken care of as well. We payed $89 a night plus tax and was well worth it. The location is good too. Will stay again on our next trip.",,,
Andy B,2514257,"This hotel is comfortable and basic. For the money you pay to stay here you cannot complain. My room did not have a view but I'm not in Vegas to look out of windows! If you want a view go up the top of Paris or any walkover bridge! Next door to New York New York, and opposite MGM Grand, 2 great hotels. This is my first review of a hotel as I was fed up of reading bad reviews...what did they expect for the money!! It's not the Wynn! To sum it up, good price, good location and comfortable room. I stayed here on 30th January. Great location, friendly staff, nice bedroom. A few things that keep it in the realm of 4*. The bathroom was an refit i.e. the bath and plumbing were sub par. Keen to charge $14 for WiFi which seems cheap given the expense of the room. The t.v. was old so a small screen and poor quality image. All in all a good hotel with a few provisos. We spent 5 nights at the Bayswater over Christmas and found the hotel to be excellent as a bit of a luxury base during our 3 month travels mostly staying in hostels. On first arriving, we were slightly worried about noise as the shuttle dropped us in what looked like party capital; Kings Cross. However, this just proved that the hotel was very central (2 minutes walk from Kings Cross train station) and yet once inside, the noise wasn't heard plus our room was at the back of the property. Everything was clean, the room a good size with the boutique theme continuing and plates, bowls and cutlery provided and even wineglasses - very civilised! The concierge staff were friendly especially the gentleman who checked us in and out. The cleaners were great, and when we did use any crockery, if we left it in the bathroom they would clean it for us. The only things of note were a slight drain smell from the bathroom, which disappeared once we had used it a bit, and the fact that the room was a bit dark as one window faced a wall. But we both had a very nice Christmas here and it felt like a little hideaway in beautiful and bustling Sydney! What a [--], i would expect prison to be better than this hotel, breakfast was ok if you like cornflakes or cornflakes. We checked in and were given our room then straight out to watch the football. We returned at midnight and went straight to sleep. At 4am the poster woke us up demanding we come t reception and pay for our room. Must have woken half of the hotel up shouting and knocking at our door. Not sure why they didnt take my payment on arrival or when we got in but 4am was not the time i know that. Couldnt sleep after so spoilt the weekend. interesting decoration, superb bed and perfect location staff was exeselent slightly overpriced as for Easter, but I would still book it if I was going for another short trip here My wife and son recently stayed for 3 night's here, whilst traveling in America. The level of friendly and attentive service was exceptional. All the staff just could'nt do enough and came across as very genuine. Not the have a nice day because it is part or the script! but that they wanted them to have a great day. This hotel was beautiful. Right off the beach, nice pool area and gorgeous grounds. I really wish the staff had been up to the same standards. Of the six days that we were there, our trash was never taken out, our sheets were not changed and our room was not vacuumed. The cleaning staff basically came in and pulled the sheets up. Every place to eat in the hotel had extremelly slow service. Even the staff at the front desk was unhelpful. They couldnt tell us where to find anything on the island. Overall, it was beautiful, but there were three resorts within walking distance which I would highly reccommend over the Sheraton. At the time of booking the hotel was marked with 4 stars. I do not know how the star rating is done but this is not even near a 4 star hotel. The good things about this hotel are, the room size and the convenient location in Manhattan. Must say, the staff were polite and helpful.The room furnishing is dated, it belongs to a different era, something like 1980s. The TV is small and very old but hey, who wants to wach telly in the city that doesn't sleep :) The bathroom is very big but the shower old and tiny, and I really mean tiny. The smallest shower I have ever used. The room is noisy for two reasons, the window was facing the back alley and was near some big industrial unit that was noisy, plus the street noise from the Broadway. The most annoying was the noise from the water pipes, if somebody next door was using their bathroom the noise in the room was loud. Continental breakfast was a joke. They provide bagels and something that looks like Philadelphia cheese. There are croissants and cupcakes as well. The coffee and orange juice taste awful. So, forget about the breakfast and go grab a nice one outside. Overall, this place feels like a better hostel and not a 4 star hotel. Even tough all NYC hotels are expensive, the price of over $300 feels like a rip off. Also, they charge $9.95 + tax for WI-FI connection per day.

Stayed here for 2 nights with Mum, and generally found the price we paid for a hotel this close to London reasonable. Our room had a couple of minor issues. The drawers needed a wipe out and the TV remote was missing but these were easily resolved. The hotel could do with a bit of an update but in regards to cleanliness we had no problems at all. One other slightly annoying thing was that the Wifi didn't connect from our room, but if you are just checking emails quickly then sitting in the lobby is fine! Breakfast was basic, (cereal, toast and jam, tea and juice) but again considering the price that we paid I didn't really expect much more. Staff were friendly and helpful, very good service with this. About 5 minutes walk from Wembley Central Tube, about 30 mins to London on the Tube, so close enough to explore the capital. Overall, would stay here again if the price was the same. unfortunatly our stay here was dissapointing to say the least, cost us Â£135 to stay here for 2 nights, where do i beginning, well firstly the car park was more like a squeeze your car in if you can park, they was a massive skip plonked to the side of it, and old matteresses and beds lying to the side of it, and they were truely awful, when we did check into our room,oh my god, they was damp spots up the wall, the room stunk like damp, there was food stains all over the walls, wires along the floor, the carpets were sticky, only two out of the 6 sockets worked, the shower only worked when the people in the rooms around us werent using there showers, the walls were paper thin, and the doors to all the rooms were not secure at all there were huge gaps under the door and you could here everything and everyone, when the person in the next room when to the bathroom, ie using the shower and the toliet, you could here everything and i mean everything, the room up above us had very squeeky floor boards as thats all you could here all the time. we choose to stay at this hotel as it was close to wembley arena, 10 minutes walk, they are plenty of shops and resturants around the area, they were the only good things, next time it will be some where like travel lodge id rather spend more, i would recommend to anyone, didnt find anything wrong with this hotel.great location for the stadium and arena.friendly staff,good breakfast(soggy toast???) and drinks.room was quite comfortable and clean.walls a little thin (couple next door!!).would stay here again if going to another gig at the arena. The room was quite nice. The bed was comfy. The gentlemen who checked us in and out was friendly. The location is good for Wembley Stadium and also close to Wembley Central tube station so easily accessible from central London. Breakfast was a pretty typical continental, no croissant though which at some places I've really enjoyed. Well what do you say, this hotel is false advertising at its best. To start don't believe the pictures on this website apart from the front. Where things went wrong: to start we booked this hotel. next we arrived. Being constructively critical the room is of good size for me, fiance and child. The shower didn't drain which was sorted when mentioned in the morning. I called reception to ask for a TV remote, which wasn't delivered but I had to go and get? Service industry remember? Went for our advertised continental breakfast in the morning, this comprised cornflakes, soggy toast and tinned fresh! fruit salad. I'm sure those on the continent would be proud!! the juices are plentiful though not surprising considering the apple juice which i gave to my son tasted like urine?? While talking to the manager in the morning regarding the shower, I mentioned that the bed was completely knackered as we were basically sleeping on the broken divan base. He said straight away don't worry we'll change it, and guess what coming back from a long day visiting sites in London nothing had been done. Overall the location was perfect for Wembley, visiting London which was less than 20minutes on the tube. However the Â£50 per night price tag, considering where you can stay in the country for the same is a mistake i won't make again in London. Shocking enough was the breakfast but not sleeping on a comfortable bed is disgraceful. I only hope people who read this do reaslise that this is an overpriced youth hostel and nothing more. But thank you for your apologies on reception that is adequate compensation for a truely memorable stay!!!! I can only say that it is obvious that the positve reviews of this hotel have been posted by staff on the night shift We travelled to London to see Status Quo at Wembley Arena, and once again chose the Euro Wembley as our hotel of choice !! This hotel is so convenient to Wembley Central tube station, and we always feel welcome by the staff. Our room (32) although quite small, was more than adequate, with a comfortable bed, spotless linen and also a spotless ensuite shower room. Another bonus to this hotel is its quiet location - unusual for London - and much appreciated after 2 nights of partying. Also recommended is the nearby Thirsty Eddies irish bar (on way to Wembley Arena) - a bar full of characters who always make you welcome, and the karaoke Saturday night was something we will not forget in a while !! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants fantasic value for money, and convenience of location. Our room Reasonable hotel near Wembley Stadium, 5-10 minute walk, plenty of local eateries, hotel basic, but clean tidy, with friendly staff, contintetal breakfast very basic, but for the price paid, doubt you would find much better, remember if you want 4 star quality you need to pay 4 star prices, you get what you pay for, and would definitely use this hotel again when attending a wembley event We stayed at the hotel in August for an event at Wembley. It is in an ideal situation from Wembley. The rooms are dirty and very tired. The staff were rude except for the breakfast staff. There was no kettle in our room and when asked if we could have one we were told that there wasn't any in the hotel left and that there should be one in our room and we must have moved it. Only cups and and tea and coffee making stuff no kettle!",,,
Samantha F,232879,"stayed here for a birthday trip to the dam and was pleased at the standard of the hotel, we booked via easyjet so great value for money! we were not expecting a great standard due to the great location and the great price but were amazed at the funky decor lovely clean rooms, and the very friendly staff. The bar is pretty amazing a must for a night cap! very good location trams run near by and the lovley vondlepark is next door which is a must see! excellent! cant wait to visit again!! Lovely hotel, very high quality service, the staff were very polite and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was amazing! one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in, it made our holiday! thank you!","Lovely hotel, very high quality service, the staff were very polite and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was amazing! one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in, it made our holiday! thank you! Sweet, tranquil and clean looking rooms at very affordable rates! 3 mins walk to the main Terminal where u need to get around in trains or buses for tours or luggage reasons. Great for tourist and lovers. Hotel service is very personal as it only has about 20 over rooms to manage! I'm rating the Hotel Marghera 5 star, not because it's a ""5 star"" hotel, but because it's a ""5 star"" experience in a 3 star hotel. The room is a nice size, is clean, and has a small refrigerator. The shower was small, but then all of the shower stalls we saw in Italy were small! The breakfast provided was excellent (at least a 20 Euro). To go a little further, it's an easy 5 to 8 minute walk from the exit at the termi station. Personnel is great, and will let you leave your suitcases there if you arrive before their 2 p.m. check-in. The Metro station is really convenient to the hotel, also the buses are right there infront of the station. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Rome! Booked online from official website, confirmed by the phone: very helpfull staff. Web site pics worth of trust. Confortable, clean and nice decorated rooms (we had double) aircon, wi-fi internet access. Personnel kind and helpful for every needs. Buffet breakfast (7.30 to 9.30 am). Good location: 20 mins away from Coliseum or Spanish Steps. We had a reservation in a hotel across the street from Hotel Marghera and they did not have a room for us so, they tried to put us up in a hostel. We refused and ended up stopping in the Hotel Marghera. Antonio, the owner, was extremely hospitable and gave us a good rate for 3 nights! The hotel is a cozy boutique style and the owners are very proud of their services. The decor was sweet, the rooms were not spacious but adequate for 2 people, they had nice cool airconditioning and a beautiful breakfast room! The staff was very friendly and made our stay a very positive one! This is truly a hotel and not a pension pretending to be a hotel. The decor and hospitality was wonderful! It's located a block from the train station and access to the entire city of Rome is very easy. We did not have to use a taxi once during our stay in Rome! Sehr familiÃ¤re und freundliche AtmosphÃ¤re. Ãberraschend sauber. Keine Komplikationen. Sehr gute Lage, um Stadttouren zu FuÃ oder per ÃNVP zu starten, da es sich direkt an der Altstadt befindet. In der NÃ¤he befindet Bahnhof Termini. Im Wohnblock gibt es einige gute und gÃ¼nstige Gelegenheiten zum Essen. Very well located close to the centre of Rome with almost every place of interest within a comfortable walking distance. Termini Station are only a few minutes walk . The room price included breakfast classed as buffet and included croissants, cakes, fresh rolls, boiled eggs, ham & salami, cheese and jam. Plenty of food and served with juice and coffee. Good wireless internet connection in the room. Room was clean if a little small and beds were very comfortable. Nice bathroom with bidet. Staff very helpful. Double glazed windows so very quiet and qood curtains kept out the light. Definately would go back. We settled on this hotel for 3 nights. And this old lady Who i found out is the Owner is always yelling on her worker.. It's always like that.. And one time me and my husband taking a nap when we heard a loud voice And its her.. And i said to my husband godness i thought there's a fire! Even the other lady we saw them shouting at each other. Ang i thought i rent a room to have some rest after a day out but what do we get? So terible! And not to' mention the chairs has many many stains curtains that i think that heve'nt washEd for years. God its already black! And one time we saw a dog footprint on our table napkin. And my husband told me that's it let's transfer to onother hotel. An advice to all who's planning to prenotate on this hotel if want to have the wonderful stay in rome don't stay on that awful place! We arrived yesterday from Rome and had really bad experience with this hotel. We were 6 persons in 2 rooms. One of the rooms was a total disaster, nothing worked properly in the bathroom: broken toilet seat, water flows from shower directly on the floor etc. Lamps inside the room and on the balcony not working, fridge not working. Balcony is full messy and dirty like a storage room. I asked the manager to repair these but nothing happened. The washroom was next to our room, that means noise, singing and chatting from 6 am. The worst part: money was missing one afternoon, I mentioned it the manager, he got angry and said he can't believe it. I said the feeling is mutual... And he never told us a ""sorry"" or something like that. I do not recommend this place for anybody. I would like to reserve this hotel for October 2011 and the hotel site won't allow me. I think it's because it's too far ahead. Neither I could submit this letter through the hotel site. I am planning to stay in this hotel based on responses of Mr. Eduard Ghergheluca to reviews on Tripadvisor. His responses made me think that hotel staff really cares about their guests and are commited to improve their serivces. With this being said, I respectully ask if someone from the hotel staff could contact me so I can make my reservation now. My emial: shori7@hotmail.com Thank you in advance, Shorena Hotel is well located for bars and restaurants and of course the transport hub at Termini station. An unpretentious,modest hotel with a warm welcome representing good value for money in a city centre area.Cleanliness was excellent and rooms serviced daily to a good standard. Staff courteous and efficient and breakfast though basic was well presented. A very pleasant break helped to no small measure by this hotel. Our one week stay at Hotel Marghera was pleasant and enjoyable and we will stay there again when visiting Rome. The hotel is family-owned and run [father, mother and daughter (Pierangela)] with a very friendly and accommodating atmosphere. In addition, the three most oustanding aspects of the hotel are: 1. Its proximity to Termini Station [less 50 metres] which is the transport hub for trains, metro and buses - making it very easy to access all the main sites of Rome and to/from the airports. Termini also has the best self-service restaurant with a daily variety of traditional Italian dishes. 2. While most tourist hotel rooms in Rome are generally small and old, all the rooms in the Marghera have just been renovated. Depending on your budget some rooms are larger than others. 3. The area is very quiet at night and after an exhausting day of sightseeing in very loud Roman traffic, its nice to return to a nice quiet room. Aigul & Anthony Me and my friend arrived at the hotel without a reservation and were greated very warmly and professionally from the Manager. We were given a lovely room on the 4th floor which had a double bed, two balconies. All lovely Christmas decorations throughout the hotel. We thought this place was fantastic, especially considering the price. The breakfast was just right, and it was included in the price. I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Rome when visiting friends and family (especially when the owner promised a discount! - hopefully he'll remember) Thanks for your kindness and we definetely recommend this hotel. The Marghera has well appointed rooms located within walking distance of the Termini Rail Station (literally a 2 minute walk). Our room was lovely with a canopied bed that my daughters shared and a single one for me. Very Laura Ashley in decor. Our bathroom was big with 2 sinks. Normally hotels located near rail stations can be a bit seedy but not the Marghera. They also offer a wonderful breakfast each morning. Our stay was only 2 days so the convenience of being near the Termini was helpul.",,,
comnen,304792,"Las Vegas proved to be the cheapest place in the US unless you are gambler. Excalibur was not the exception. Everything in this hotel was nice. Room on the 21th floor, all-you-can-eat menu, show (knights and Thunder from down under). We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport, and because of medieval show. Two negative impressions were: the security man, who once asked our hotel cards. and that my credit card was charged twice. but it was over-done very quickly. The staff was great! Turkish Airlines provides transit passengers with overnight stopover with a hotel. Gunes hotel is one of possible option. I liked the location (between Merter and Zaitinburnu), so one can easily take metro. The hotel is average, but clean, rooms are spacious, wifi available. Staff is polite. it is not 5 star hotel, it pretends to be 4-star, but I think it is 3+. Turkish Airlines provides passengers with overnight connection with the hotel. Akgun was very good choice. Good location, good rooms, a number of facilities available. We were arranged very easily, the staff in the morning called several times to remind of the flight, worrying if to order a taxi. In a room there is tea and coffee, wifi. I checked the prices on hotel website, they are worth it Simple, but cheap hostel in the very heart of Barcelona. Location is the advantage. The drawbacks are noise in the night that is heard as if it happens in your room (very thin walls!). They have 2 computers for free use (mice and keyboard are dirty and old; to type something is a challenge!). We stayed there 3 nights in a triple room. One of them was really terrible â new guests arrived in the midnight and we could hear everyting. They change towels everyday, all was pretty clean. Stayed at this hotel twice, rooms were the same, but the manager at the desk can change everything. It depends whom you meet if you will be treated respectfully or not. The first time manager did not ""mention"" the status in IHG program I have, did not offer anything. another time I was offered a gift from the hotel (on a random choice) and welcome drink. Totally I like the hotel and the brand as a whole, but what can I say, folks? The quality of the rooms should be accompanied with quality of service! Average hotel in Mexico city, near Insurgente metro station. Honestly, I do not understand people in Mexico taking taxis, the city is always one big traffic jam, and metro, though crowded, serves pretty well. Insurgente square is surrounded by a number of cafes, bars, etc, many of them are gay. So if you want to find this sort of people, Zona Roza is your choice. Hotel is simple, breakfast not included, but prices for meal are not high. What I want to mention - they exchange euros for pesos (us dollars - no!), and exchange rate is very good, much better than in banks They have a small business centre on the 8th floor, ask, if you need PC, printer or want to store your belongings. Las Vegas proved to be the cheapest place in the US unless you are gambler. Excalibur was not the exception. Everything in this hotel was nice. Room on the 21th floor, all-you-can-eat menu, show (knights and Thunder from down under). We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport, and because of medieval show. Two negative impressions were: the security man, who once asked our hotel cards. and that my credit card was charged twice. but it was over-done very quickly. The staff was great! Booked a room for 2 in advance with a very good price - 64 euro per night. Was afraid that would be nothing for that and also very far from the downtown. Nope! it is very conviniently located hotel (bus, metro, train. 40 minutes to Vatican, 25 minutes to Termini, 45 minutes to the airport), good spacious rooms (not less and even larger than in other HIE, quiet, though railway is not far), good breakfast. Business centre (printer, computer), internet exta (they charge 2 euro per 30 min unless you are platinum member). Surrounding are dull and there is nothing really, but if you use it a place to sleep - that is the very one Stayed there in the beginning of february, when there was a lot of flights delays. This hotel was provided by Turkish Airlines. The location is far from city attractions, but MiniaTurk is close. Surroundings are dull. The hotel itself is very nice: lobby, good breakfast (take fruits!), free wifi (ask for password). Stayed at that hotel in January 2011. Decided to get to the hotel from the airport on our own, by metro. It proved to be very quick and easy, though it was about 10-11p.m. The room was booked via promotion (-50%), and we really enjoyed our stay for such a resonable price. The only problem we faced was the usage of a TV in a room. It can be both TV and computer, but keyboard did not work well.","I recently stayed at Akgun Istanbul Hotel and booked it based upon Expedia profille.this is NOT a 5 star hotel, might be a 3.5 star hotel on a sunny day. The bathroom has a sign telling you that the water is not drinkable. To brush your teeth, you have to use bottled water which they charge you for. Half of the machines in the gymn are broken. The rooms facing the street are so loud from street traffic that it's hard to go to sleep. Very few of the staff speak English and those that do provide little help.I travel worldwide and stay in 5 star hotels. This place is a joke! I do not understand how this is a five star hotel. I have stayed here with my family and thought this was going to be a nice place to stay. They say they have a gym, the treadmill - elliptical and bike machine do not work. They have a bench without weights? The rooms are far from what you expect, hard and small. They have three English channels to watch, not great ones at that. Service has not been great, had to call three times to get them to fix something for us. All around it's not a hotel thats worth it's money. Location is not great either. Best of luck. I recently visited Istanbul and Radisson (where I generally stay) happened to be full and so was hotels like WOW and Renaissance Polat! This hotel was recommened and I went along as I could not miss the dates (Business visit). The hotel is in Topkapi and that was a plus point (Boy what a disappointment). The room rates are extravagant, to put it mildly. Internet is a disappointment and the service is abysmal! There checking time is 12:00 and they made me wait till 2:00 for a room. The rooms are large enough but poorly lighted. Except for 1 or 2 places which is accessible by rail metro going anywhere you need to hire a cab! Breakfast if you are cereals person then it is good for you or you are in for a disappointment! They have lot of variety of Cheese and butter but not much other choices. I survived on bread and butter or cheese!!!!! The hotel staff in general are not very helpful and hardly anyone speaks English!!! The only passable view is from the room that is facing the road! Rest all rooms have either buildings covering! In there website they talk about gym but when you go and enquire you'll be surprised. Firslty the person managing will try to sell you the message packages. When you stress that you are looking for the gym you'll find out that the gym is converted into a massage room and the masseur is a woman (I later learn this is the highlight of the hotel)! In totality this hotel should be your last choice and that to if you are staying not more than 2 -3 nights and not planning to be in the hotel for not more than sleeping. Akgun is a five star hotel with 3 star or below facilities. Very small and slow lifts, break fast selections were very less, staff can improve too much, room heaters with too much noice, slow internet etc... I stayed at this hotel 3 nights. November 4 when we arrived from the US and November 13 & 14, 2011 before our return to the US. The hotel is near a section of the city walls,but there is not a lot to do or to see in the area. A Burger King is about 6 blocks away. I found the room to be spacious, modern and clean. The furniture and decor in the halls is dark, but that maybe a Middle Eastern style of decoration. The WiFi in the room worked easily. The sheets and the towels were very soft. The food was very good with several options on the buffet. The only complaint was that the bottled water was always warm. Since we could not drink the water or use ice, it was not very refreshing. This hotel has a 5 star ""front of house"", but 3 star rooms and food. I travelled on business to this hotel, and I am sure that I have stayed they previously. However, it has not changed much, and the first time I stayed must have been 10 years ago! The rooms are ""dingey"" the barthrooms in particular are in dire need of restoration. The food was poor at best, ""buffet style, and if you arrive towards the closing time, you will find that what food there may have been initially, has not been replenished. Most items were European 5 star prices, how do they get away with it? In fact the only positive comment that I would make is that the doormen were attentative and helpfull. The rooms are smelly and the furniture is poor. Not sure how this hotel ever got a 5 start rating. What a rip-off. The staff barely speaks english and they have no clue about customer service. The airconditioning was weak and we ended up opening the windows and it was too noisy as the hotel fronts a busy street. The breakfast buffet was decent but no omelet and the coffee is pathetic. I had the misfortune of being put in this hotel as a result of an overbooked Turkish Air flight. They told me it is central and 5 star!!! Yea Right!!! This hotel is anything but a 5 star. The toilet/shower was tiny; the bed had the worst quality mattress I've ever seen and the a/c did not regulate any kind of temperature. Not only that, but they don't even provide you with an Iron, or a travel adaptor (according to the helpful chap at the desk, 5 star hotels don't do this). The only consolation is I didn't pay for this bout of suffering, and I strongly advise people to stay there only if they get an offer they cannot refuse. The breakfast is adequate, and the location is pretty bad, although there is a metro station 1 minute away which the receptionist was unaware of!, which stops at a tramway interchange (the interchange is a 5 minute walk from the stop). I guess in conclusion, one must manage their expectations. It is literally the standard of a Travelodge hotel in the UK and don't expect any more. At least travelodge gives you an iron if you ask. My wife and stayed here while on a tour of Turkey. While not a five-star hotel as it is listed, we found it was a good hotel for our stay in Istanbul. We got a room that had a comfortable bed and updated bathroom. The bathroom had a window in the shower that looked out into the room. Had never seen that before and it was an interesting design feature. The room also had a free bottle of water and a tea kettle which we used for our morning coffee. The dinner buffet was more memorable than breakfast. We stayed here for the first two nights of our trip and again for the last night before flying home. The last night we got a room that had a major mold problem in the shower which gave a very noticeable smell to the room. We didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want the hassle of trying to change rooms so we stayed. Turkish Airlines provides passengers with overnight connection with the hotel. Akgun was very good choice. Good location, good rooms, a number of facilities available. We were arranged very easily, the staff in the morning called several times to remind of the flight, worrying if to order a taxi. In a room there is tea and coffee, wifi. I checked the prices on hotel website, they are worth it The hotel is located in the historic part of Istanbul near the wall of the city Constantinople and the Metro Topkapi Ulubatli. This is large hotel with the concept of high service. We got a spacious room with good furnishings. In addition to the basic necessities we had tea, coffee, minibar, satellite TV and Wi-Fi in the room. Neat and clean. Also in price included a sauna, hammam and gym. Unfortunately we did not have time to take advantage as they were at the hotel only one night. This hotel is not 5 stars, I don't know why it has this rating. It is outdated, the rooms are basic and the food is terrible. The service is absolutely appalling. We were charged room service rates for our dinner (which was awful) which we had to point out to the waitor who reluctantly changed the bill. I then had the worst night's sleep as the room was way too hot. When I went down to reception to complain they told me they only have heat as it is winter (actually autumn). I wasn't even offered a fan and another member of staff actually laughed at me. The noise level was a disgrace, our room was on a busy main road. When we complained the manager wouldn't listen. We left and got charged for the 2nd night due to their 24 hr cancellation policy. Do not stay here. This is a so called 5 star hotel. The rooms were very dirty, the food was horrible, there was nothing nice about this hotel",,,
DHIIPAK,296924,"This can probably be called an ""airport hotel"" given the proximity to Madrid's Barajas international airport---which is what I chose it for laying over a night before a long flight home to California. The property seems pretty new, 4-*** and well maintained. It also appears to market small conference meetings also. As the final test of any hotel--it gave an excellent night's sleep with quiet rooms and comfortable beds -- just what I needed before my next day's 30-hour odyssey to reach the west coast of the US !. One problem with Madrid's airport district is the pretty fair distance from the city center. Taxi fare will be about 20 to 25 euros to get to many ""airport hotels"" like this one (a metro is possible with one transfer stop in between which could be inconvenient if you're hauling major luggage). One way to save is on trips to the airport if you could find other guests going there too and split the cab fare with them. The complementary Wi-Fi was fine which was a help and the price (relatively speaking for Madrid) was a good offer via www.hotels.com The BEST thing about my stay was the incredible guest service given by Ms. Cinta Correa Castano, Reception Manager. She very efficiently recovered a wrist watch I forgot in my room in an anxious rush to get to the airport. When I realized my error and called from my departure gate before boarding the staff swept my room, found my watch--and then she arranged to get it to my Spanish residence within 24 hours via mensenger service. The watch has high sentimental value and would be hard to buy again---and she treated my concern like her own in coming to my assistance. BRAVO !! I always go here when visiting Barcelona, one of europes best walking cities. ItÂ´s about 300 meters from the central Placa de Catalunya, with all the related metro stations, airport bus stop and prime real estate of the Passeig de Gracia (Gaudi buildings) . But the real attractioon here is the Ramblas....probable the best strolling & people watching boulevard in Europe (ending at the sea and continuing on to the fantastic Barcelona acquarium. The fantastic Barrio Gotico (Gothic barrio) is across the street. HOWEVER, keep to the left side of the Rambla (as you descend) to explore the side streets; as the right side (i.e., behind this hotel) is the Barrio Chino -- which can be crime ridden with drugs, prostitution, etc. And whenever on the Rambla, watch for pickpockets ! BE WARNED, this hotelÂ´s rooms are small, with just enough space for the very basic twin beds. So if you want 4-star rooms please go ahead and look (PAY $$) elsewhere. I always request one of the balcony rooms facing the Rambla and look forward to sitting there with a drink each night (i.e., beer bought at the nearby store) watching the real life street theater unfold. If you choose this option too, ALSO BE WARNED that you may get some street noise (sirens, garbage truck and loud groups walking home from the bars); but as IÂ´m a sound sleeper I get through this OK. However, if you attack Barcelona with gusto youÂ´ll be out on your feet ALL day and will be REAL tired upon return each night -- falling asleep before your head hits the pillow. The owners & staff are VERY friendly, helpful and unpretentious as the property. ItÂ´s actually undergone some very nice renovations since I began staying here in 1992 (new bathrooms, room decoration and now WiFi in rooms). Single rooms start at 50 euros/ night--with doubles about 74.","Instead of staying in the airport overnight my boyfriend and I found a great deal on Hotwire.com and stayed for one night. We arrived at the hotel before our check in time but were told that we could check in since the room was ready. The room was perfect for the two of us and also had a balcony which was really nice. The balcony was basic but we had no idea we would be getting one in the first place. Diego helped us most of the time we were there and also made sure to call a taxi for us to get to the airport in the morning. It cost us â¬21 to get to Barajas airport and the taxi driver was waiting for us in the lobby (we were even early). Also there is free internet which was easy to access. The only things I didn't like was the guy who worked in the dining area. He may have been the only one doing the whole thing (making the food, taking orders, serving, & cleaning up) but he was a bit short and nasty to us. Also, the metro wasn't too far, but it would have been nice if it were closer. Maybe took about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is very modern and clean. There are also smoking or non-smoking rooms available. This hotel is located 20 minutes by bus / Metro from city center and offers very good services: Great , comfy rooms, a nice breakfast, very good and fasy service by all empolyees we stumbled by. They fixed the safe deposit box within minutes, printed out some material we needed by minutes, were very kind, polite and helpful explaining everything to us. The beds matreses are Visco quality I think, which is rare to find in hotels... In short - definitely consider staying here again! I stayed for two nights at Confortel AlcalÃ¡ Norte, on a business trip to a client nearby. The room was spacious and very comfortable, the bathroom also very good. Buffet breakfast was OK, there wasn't any yogurt and fruit was also not in the largest of supplies, average I'd say. Something strange is that being a 4-star the only amenities provided were a small piece of soap and two small vials of shampoo, so if you want to wash your hands and use in the shower you have to use the same soap. Also, they don't replenish the amenities when they clean the room. Free water bottles are provided in the mini bar (the only content), but not replenished during the stay. The area is quite deserted at night with very few options for dinner, and the restaurant cafeteria is, well, short of miserable, serving salads, sandwiches, burguers or pizzas. This hotel does not have irons or hairdryers in the room, nor do they have an ironing room. The only thing they offer is a chargeable laundry service. The rooms are OK but the facilities are sparse.

The watch has high sentimental value and would be hard to buy again---and she treated my concern like her own in coming to my assistance. BRAVO !! There are always surprises. I got this as a result of Priceline and I was freaked out when I looked at its location and more freaked when I tried to find one cold December evening. The walk from the Suanzes Metro stop was dicey to say the least in that it was a brisk fifteen minute walk to the metro station on the number 5 line. When I finaly arrived, I was pleased that the huge bunker of a hotel had large rooms and a super duper large bathroom. The staff is really competent and not only that, they are down to earth yet very professional. The walk to the metro was ususally long, past showrooms and a gas station BUT I soon learned another way. If one gets off the metro at Ciudad Lineal and waits for the 105 bus which runs on Julian Camarillo, one can skip the walk altogether and arrive after the bus makes a left turn on San Romualdo. The breakfasts in the restaurant are a great deal on the weekends if they are having a special discount. Otherwise, the food is just alright. The free and very swift wifi is a great feature in the hotel that other properties, even those which are more pricey would be wise to emulate. When weeks later I was stuck without wifi because another nearby hotel had no connection to the internet ( right? ) the staff here was nice enough to remember me and let me use the two free pcs in the lobby. Very nice. The only drawback besides the remoteness is the lack of a gym. the building is huge thing and though there is parking, no gym? I guess they are hoping people will walk to the metro. Nearby there is a park to run but I did not try it. I would later try another Confortel in the Madrid area and was disappointed after staying at the Confortel Alcala Norte. The rooms are huge for Madrid and I think that one could do worse by booking a hotel in Madrid, centrally located or not, and not giving the Confortel Alcala a chance. One just should get used to a little hike.",,,
vilen,504891,"I stayed there for a week. If you want true quality at average price â this is right choice. First you could benefit from convenient location â 15 min work from Paddington, 5 min to Bayswater metro station (central line), up 10 min to Kensington gardens. Even more there is a bus N23 that takes you directly to Oxford street and St. Pall. The room is small but acceptably clean. Breakfast is rather poor but you could bring some more with you. Very noisy at the weekends Absolutely garbage! Never stay there. The staff is absolutely rude and impudent. Firstly they charged my card twice and refused to refund. Instead of $500 they changed me $1000. I was forced to call the bank to cancel the transaction. The room was in poor condition, the condition was leaking. I would not say this is 4 stars hotel. The breakfast is perfect. The room is spacious, it was cleaned daily. But nobody changes lines within 7 days. I forced to changed room because the first one was so noisy that I cannot sleep because of cars and trains. Too far from city center â you need to use train or metro. As local people explained this is a discounted hotel on the Eurostar chain, I do not object but it does not cost 140 Euros per room.","Needed a room for a one night transit in Singapore. Should've spent more. Spent a listless night in a cramped room that smelled of mildew. Reception was tired and almost rude. There are other places. A family friend booked this hotel for me so I didn't know what to expect. I'm a pretty easy going guy but on the way from the airport, when the taxi driver asked me where I was staying and I told him, he proceeded to ask if I like Vietnamese girls.??? Right there and then, I knew this hotel was going to be questionable. Hotel 81 is apparently located right off of Singapore's biggest red light district, Geylang rd. In my opinion, Singapore's red light district is pretty tame by North American standards but it gets very loud with KTV bars and restaurants open until the wee hours of the night so it was difficult for me to get good sleep. On top of that, people kept going in and out throughout the night slamming the door making it even more difficult for me to sleep. Other reviews mentioned prostitues frequent the hotel often, so maybe that's where my taxi driver was getting at. The rooms are small, but tolerable if you are travelling alone. Some rooms do not have windows but mine did. But you can't open them. The bed was alright but it had quite a bit of ants on it and that frustrated me. The sheets were dirty too. The bathroom and shower are adequate. Kettle and tea provided. The staff was rude and not helpful at all. There are a lot of good cheap halal restaurants nearby as well as some markets for shopping so that was a plus. However, the nearest MRT station, Paya Lebar, is a 15 min walk which is quite far. All in all, staying at this hotel is not a recommended choice of mine. Absolutely garbage! Never stay there. The staff is absolutely rude and impudent. Firstly they charged my card twice and refused to refund. Instead of $500 they changed me $1000. I was forced to call the bank to cancel the transaction. The room was in poor condition, the condition was leaking. we went to Singapore twice, Dec 2010 and 2nd time recently. Last year we stayed in this hotel for 3days. Room too small, but we have no choice since 81 Tristar fully booked that time. If you looking for bigger room with budget cost, recommended to go to 81 Tristar family room compared to 81 Joo Chiat. Halal food is every where, no woories for muslim. however, nearest LRT need to take from Paya Besar, which it is around 15mins walking distance actually quite far. no suitable to stay if you intend to travel by train with small kids. room service = ok, bed = ok only. But, suggesting to find hotel nearby Orchard road since there more shopping heaven compared to this area. we had left the cruiser costa and we were sent to hotal 81 by the information service at cruise center.got there ok by taxi,nowhere for car drop off,luckily being weekend we were dropped by roadside.we were told room wont be ready until 8pm that day,disgrace.out for most of the day and we were hoping for good night sleep,oh no'bed was as hard as rock might as well sleep on floor.we were too tired to complain.we left the room at 09.00.they kindly kept our luggage.fee too high for service that was provided.very poor The room size is too small. It is very difficult to move around the room. Moreover, the location of the Hotel is such odd that either you can take a taxi or to board a bus or take a train you need to walk for at least 15 min. It is very near to Red light area GAYLAND, that too is the problem. It is not preferable to stay in the hotel. The hotel was clean.The room size was terrible.U cannot even move in the room as bed takes the whole space.The corridors of the floors are also too narrow.The staff was little helpful.The hotel is located deep down the road you have to walk good 15mins for nearest station.The red light area Geylang also comes in between .You can spot pimps even in daylight.",,,
Charlie K,1749509,"Very clean and well maintained hotel.....Only a few blocks from Crescent Street/St. Catherine Street/and Bell Centre. Very affordable. Only negatives are restaurant and Wi-Fi Very nice hotel with good breakfast and amenities for a major city's downtown area. Reasonably affordable....Rooms a bit on small side but ok....Great locale as far as CTA and city's attractions. We were driving through the area on our way to the south coast, last minute we decided to take a break, we booked in and had a good nights sleep, the kids had a swim in the pool in the morning, the houskeeping girls were very friendly we asked for additional towels, tea & coffee they were attentative. The accommodation was good value and a nice break from driving. Would definately stay again.","We were driving through the area on our way to the south coast, last minute we decided to take a break, we booked in and had a good nights sleep, the kids had a swim in the pool in the morning, the houskeeping girls were very friendly we asked for additional towels, tea & coffee they were attentative. The accommodation was good value and a nice break from driving. Would definately stay again. We made a booking through wotif.com the price was reasonable. We were expecting basic style accommodation, we chose the location as we needed to be relatively close to Vision Eye Institute Hurstville Clinic as I had an early appointment for laser surgery for the following morning. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms older style, clean bed linen & towels, basic facilities and considering the highway location not too noisy. We were able to leave our car in their car-park for the day, reception arranged for a taxi. Overall very pleasant experience, excellent location. Ohh how I wish I had found this website before I booked a room at the Blakehurst Motor Inn! We recently took a road trip to the Gold Coast and looked for cheap and cheerful accommodation along the way. This place was cheap but by no stretch of the imagination was it cheerful. I can only confirm what everyone else has said on this website and the words that spring to mind when I think of the Blakehurst Motor Inn are 's**t hole' (sorry, I don't normally swear but that just about sums it up). We have a 9month old son who we couldn't even put on the floor because it was so filthy. When my husband complained and asked if we could move to another room he was given keys to another room that was actually worse than the one we were in and all the lady on reception could say was "" well the hotel is quite old"". I don't understand how places like this are allowed to stay open, in my opinion it should be closed down!!!! We couldn't get out of there quick enough. This hotel was disgusting that bad we couldn't even stay & instead travelled 3hrs home after our full day & night social engagement.Carpets thread bare,stained & wet curtains ripped, falling off rails & filthy. Staff couldn't care 2 hoots about anything. In all a pigs stye & not fit for animals let alone humans. Kissed my money goodbye but our heallth was more important This place is an absolute dump. Filthy rooms, cockroaches, mould on every surface. Broken lamps, terrible TV reception, rude staff who could not have cared less about the state of the place. We rang the owner about the state of the place today and she couldn't have cared less either. We were charged $200 for the family room which is about $199 over priced. I wouldn't let my dog stay there. We have a four month old that we wouldn't let near the floor for fear of her catching something. We took photos of the filth and are reporting it to the health authorities. This has to be the worst hotel in Sydney. NEVER AGAIN.",,,
Tuer,228655,"Apart from its localization itself, there's nothing special about this hotel. Room was OK, but the bed was not specially comfortable (I could actually feel the mattress springs) and the shower was very very small. There was a laptop with internet connection in my room, so that's quite convenient if you are not travelling with yours. This is quite an old hotel which needs some changes. Rooms are very small and noisy! and not very clean, to be honest. It's true location is quite good and prices are very competitive but if you can afford a better place, don't stay here.","We stayed here in early July on a short city break. It is not, as other reviewers have pointed out, the most glamorous or luxurious or cutting-edge hotel in the wonderful city of Madrid, but it is clean, well-maintained, quiet (very unusual for this city!), and is a real bargain. We booked in advance (in May) through the central Husa website, and got the room for just under Â£70 per night, and for that price it is outstanding. If it is your first visit to the city, you might prefer to stay closer to the best-known tourist locations, but we have been to Madrid frequently, and this was a great place to be based, amid the shops and cafes of the upmarket Salamanca district, with a Metro station five minutes walk away, buses and cab ranks close by, and a relaxed, lesiurely stroll to the centre of the city. The room was a good size, the bathroom excellent, particularly good wifi internet connection, and the beds guaranteed a good night's sleep. Perhaps a small armchair would have made the room more comfortable, and some visitors might lament the lack of any non-Spanish TV channels. Staff were always helpful at the front desk, and the daily cleaning of the room was particularly thorough and efficient. Cannot comment on the breakfasts as we paid a room-only rate and used the numerous local cafes (Le Pain Quotidien is especially good). We have stayed in fancier Madrid hotels, but we have never stayed in one which offered such quality at such a good price. This is quite an old hotel which needs some changes. Rooms are very small and noisy! and not very clean, to be honest. It's true location is quite good and prices are very competitive but if you can afford a better place, don't stay here. We just came back from our honey moon around Spain. In Madrid we spent a week, where we stayed in hotel Husa Serrano Royal. This was one of the best hotels we stayed for far. We loved the customer service and convenient location of this hotel. Hotel Husa is located in the center of the city what makes everything nearby. It was a great surprise for us when we checked out at 5 am, and we were greeted with coffee and tea. Without a doubt we recommend this hotel. The hotel location was good for walking to shopping and to get a taxi, some resturants in the area. If you like the High end shops this is the place to be. There is other more affordable shopping in the area also. This area is also a Tax Free Shopping Zone. The breakfast in the morning was good, they will make you anything you wish and the coffee is made when ordered. The front desk staff was very helpful, they do speak english. Most of them are helpful and knowledgeable about the attractions and shows to see. Would stay again. We have stayed a lot of times at the Serrano Royal. Being half a block from Serrano it is a perfect base for visiting and shopping in Madrid. It has nice rooms with a lot of light - some bathrooms do not have a good ventilation - and prices are reasonable if you book in advance. The lobby is two flight of stairs from the street and there is no ramp. From the lobby the elevator serves all rooms. This is not a hotel for persons with mobility problems, but staff is there to help you with your baggage.",,,
Ryan C,488647,"I stayed over a week this past summer. It was a fantastic experience. Fresh tea or coffee in the lobby every morning along with complimentary NYT and Wall Street Journal. I ordered room service twice and it was brought swiftly within a half hour. You are located very close to FIT, a whole foods, and the subway. Chelsea is a a beautiful area of New York and everyday can be a different adventure! We stayed here for 5 nights during our trip to Rome. DONT listen to the complaints on here about holes in the walls, bad bathrooms and terrible mattresses. We didnt see ANY holes in any of the walls. The bathrooms were great (although the one shower did leak all over the floor) with hot water everytime we showered. Our room was good, with a sink in the corner, which was very handy. The room was not decorated so it was kind of bland, but no one goes to Rome to hang out in the hotel room anyway. Location was great, only blocks away from the train station. Rooms were cleaned everyday. The beds were very comfy, and the hotel was replacing all the mattresses about halfway into our stay. The staff were amazing, particularly the owner of the hotel. Very accomodating, always available at the front desk, and gave us very good advice when it came down to us traveling to Naples. Would definitely stay here again I had the pleasure of staying here last week for 4 days in a Executive Suite. What an amazing property. The room was quite large for Hong Kong standards and had a nice large bathroom, sitting room, and bedroom. The amazing staff is really what makes this hotel exceptional. Everyone we interacted with went out of their way to give us attention and help. The concierge team made amazing recommendations, and every restaurant they told us to visit was amazing. The grand club was also amazing. With great views of the harbour and surrounding areas, it provided a great place to relax, eat the amazing breakfast spread, or the great dinner spread. Drinks are also provided from 5:30-7:30. It has a great location that makes it a quick cab ride to Lan Kwai Fong where we spent most nights going out on the town. It is also a quick 5 minute walk to the star ferry where you can ride to TST. I highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when I visit Hong Kong again, which is hopefully soon. We stayed at the Bahama House in the first week in August. We got to the hotel around 11:30 and our room was ready! This was great news considering we just had a very long drive. My daughter noticed the cookies at check in and helped herself. The hotel has underground parking and a elevator that takes you from the parking level to your hotel floor. This made it very convienent to bring the lugguage to your room. Our room was very spacious with a kitchen. We had an ocean view. Our room was in the very front of the hotel furtherest away from the beach but the view was still great. The advantage of this front room was that we had an extra window in the front. Our balcony was very large and we loved sitting out there. The hotel is right next to a beach entrance if you want to drive your car on the beach (that is always fun). You do not need to because the hotel has a foot entrance to the beach. I did notice a strong urine odor by the entrance to the beach however. The beach was beautiful and lovely to walk on any time of day. The hotel provides sand buckets and shovels for the kids to play with. There are people that rent out beach chairs and umbrellas for 30 dollars For all day right by the hotel. There was also a food truck in front if you wanted some quick snacks. All in all we will be back to this hotel! Thanks for an awesome stay! I visited Venice during the low season (mid-December) and I was attracted to its price and location. Ideally I didn't want to sleep in a dorm with others and it was not easy to find a cheap single room, but this hotel had it. The location is fantastic, very near to Piazalle Roma bus station and having arrived after the sky turned dark, finding the hotel was not hard at all. True, it was far from the main attractions but actually walking to San Marco only took me 30 minutes, not a big deal for me. Being away also means lower price; I especially like how it was near to the San Margherita Square, which was a student hang out area with cheaper food. The interior is cosy and clean. My room is on the 3rd floor with no elevator but it doesn't matter for me as I travel lightly. I didn't get the room with the canal view but that's fine too since I'm out all day. I got a double bed for a single room all by myself! The toilet was complete as well. But I especially appreciate the free WiFi in the room: very fast connection, and great for a quick research before heading out! Staff speaks good English and are friendly too. One day the toilet light did not work and they fixed it promptly after I told them. Restaurant next door's breakfast was decent, nothing special but good enough for me, I'm not a luxury traveler after all and breakfast provided means at least I don't need to hunt for something to eat with a hungry stomach. Further down the hotel there is a pastry shop that sells a good variety of pastries if the breakfast is not enough, and it is featured in my LonelyPlanet guide too. Overall, great little hotel, wouldn't really mind to stay there again! p/s: They received a certificate from Trip Advisor as one of the better hotels too! It was in Italian so I can't really understand it but it has got stars on it and the word Excellent so you get what I mean. I stayed over a week this past summer. It was a fantastic experience.

Chelsea is a a beautiful area of New York and everyday can be a different adventure! My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights earlier this month. The location really cannot be beaten. Minutes away from the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain, it is literally in the heart of Rome. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Rome. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was extremely comfortable. The breakfast was very delicious and offered many options. My only complaint was that the drinks in the bar were quite expensive. I believe I paid around â¬14 for a bourbon and seven, yikes! Would definitely stay here again!!! Just got back from a 8 day stay here with my family. The rooms were clean with the exception of the hide a bed sheets were not changed. They did change them the next day after I slept the night on the couch. The swimming pool was nicely built but the water was very cold. Everyone that was trying to swim agreed it could have been 10 degrees warmer. The location was great and the place was quiet. The hot tub was perfect.","This little hotel, albeit a 2 star, was very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We ended up changing back to this hotel after returning from Florence and being unhappy with the other hotel we had booked. The staff were very accommodating and put us in the best available room and then changed us to a better room when it became available the next day. This hotel is perfectly located and not more than a 15-20 minute walk to all the main sights (some closer of course). We would both stay in this hotel again and recommend it to others who are looking for the Rome experience and don't want to pay a bucket for accommodation. Be sure to ask for a room with a shower and toilet if that is what is expected/advertised. this is a very clean hotel with excellent service and the location is great near termini and city center you won't find better hotel for 40 euros Nice spacy rooms Friendly and sympathic staff HIGHLY RECOMMENDED We stayed here for 5 nights during our trip to Rome. DONT listen to the complaints on here about holes in the walls, bad bathrooms and terrible mattresses. We didnt see ANY holes in any of the walls.

Very accomodating, always available at the front desk, and gave us very good advice when it came down to us traveling to Naples. Would definitely stay here again My friend and I (both students from UK) stayed here on our 3 day trip to Rome in October. We found the location to be excellent! Close to the main station, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, and bus routes/underground to anywhere you wanted to go. Everything was within walking distance. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and made us feel welcome. Our room and the shared bathrooms were clean and neither of us had to wait once to get into them. The rooms had everything that we needed, and there was no construction work so we got a peaceful nights sleep. They also provided us with a hair dryer, and extra pillows and blankets when we asked. The free wifi was also good, and they had a laptop accessible if people didn't have their own. I had no problems with this hotel, and I think its a very convenient place to stay for a trip to Rome. I first stayed at here (then called, Pensione Texas), in 1979, on a solo trip, to ffind My Italian Ancestors Trip, inspired by the Book 'Roots'. It was my first stop, on my first trip to Europe, and memorable. I was delighted I was able to find it from memory, after arriving via train, in March of 2011, on a visit with my 19 year old daugher, on a side trip from Florence. The location is still great, all the main sites are closeby. The rooms were really worn down. The prices I though were good condsidering location. The staff was helpful and eager to help! We did not make a reservation prior, and just walked up to see if they had room. We were not told, until checkout, they do not take Visa, only American Express or Cash? I did not ask before hand, just assumming Visa would be OK. I did not see that listed in the site, when I just checked now? So when you make reservations I recommend confirming their payment policy. I'm a college student so already, I was looking for budget deals and wasn't expecting to get 5 star service nor an amazingly beautiful hotel. I was in Rome for the week, traveling with my two girlfriends. The location of Hotel Texas is superb. 5 min walk from the Trevi Fountain, 5 mins more from Pantheon.... The staff was kind the host was understanding and helpful. Oh, and free WIFI was good too. The downsides: COLD SHOWER WATER. Hotel inconsistently had a functioning water system forcing us to go without showering for 3 days. It did eventually get fixed. CONSTRUCTION. There was so much noise and hammering and drilling that I don't think I slept well for even one of the nights. I was always woken up in the morning at 730am by some sort of remodeling project. COLD ROOMS. The heaters don't work. February isn't a particularly cold month, mid 50s F or 10-12 C....But, we were told that Rome has a 12 hour rule that you can only have the heaters on for 12 hours out of the day. We ended up freezing at night. NO HAIR DRYERS. This may be picky, but the website said it would provide hair dryers and it neglected to do so. SHARED BATHROOM. Now, dorm life is what it is but the only issue I had with the sharing of one bathroom was that the toilet water didn't flush well (making it just an overall unpleasant experience.) Our room had it's own sink though, making it slightly more convenient. At the end of our stay, we complained to the owner about how much trouble we went through by staying there. He agreed to give us a discount for all of the inconveniences. BIG PLUS for students on a budget and for the hotel manager having a soul. I recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for great location, medium/low cost, and someone with very few expectations. The location was great, the price was good and the staff aimed to please. The rooms were shabby and basic. They are in the process of remodeling. We are a Romanian couple and we stayed two nights in hotel texas. I was surprised by the warm welcome from the staff. And they gave us good tips since I was in Rome for the first time. Every morning we were served a good breakfast and each time we found our way back t already cleahe room clean fresh towels. If you are not looking for a luxury hotel, I recommend this hotel. Have a nice holidays! Ascolta Trascrizione fonetica Dizionario - Visualizza dizionario dettagliatolocuzione0.there are",,,
KFilip,502354,"hotel have good location in China Town, very easy to move around... but, i waited for check in for 1 hour, i still do not understand what was the problem... rooms are ok, my room was on 12th floor, with great panoramic view. Lobby bar is packed with mosquitoes, i was really eaten alive while was waiting there. i booked my stay in that hotel since it was only available (made late booking) but if you are not in same position, for same or less price you can get much better quality. Hotel Martinenz is located 10 minutes walking distance from Heghia Sophia and Blue Mosque, 5 minutes to Grand Bazar. district Laleli is famous shopping district so if you are fan of shopping i strongly recommend it. It is obvious that hotel is renovated, so accommodation is ok. price of the hotel comparing to quality is great. Keep in mind that guests of hotel are mainly Russians and Ukrainians (possibly shop owners) so they can be pretty noisy (packing, unpacking .... quarreling). Breakfast is not quite good, but if you are not picky person should be ok. Service at lobby basically do not exist.... there are numerous small things which can be annoying, such as missing parts in bathroom, very small TV, not properly organized room, but i underline, for its price, it is great. although i have been in Istanbul many times i could not believe that i will finish up in sleeping in this hotel. Location> hotel is located in Yenikapi it is walking distance to Aksaray, also walking distance from Grand Bazar but only for those who are good with orientation, since between hotel and Ordu Cadesi street in which is located hotel Grand Bazar, is a complex of small streets. hotel is not in so quiet neighborhood, since across the street there is a cargo company office which start working early in the morning, and workers make huge noise. Rooms> hotel has rooms which have window which looks inside the building, so basically there was no fresh air (at least not in my room) walls of the rooms where cowered with wallpapers which where used by some guests to express their inner artist (wallpapers where Scrabbled ) bathroom was small and not properly organized (i could not get out of a bath , although with 80 kg weight i could not consider myself obese ) Breakfast > very modest, 2 types of salami , 3 types of Jam, sausage, and sigara Borek pie. also there where some serials but milk which was there was rotten. (when i mention that to the waiter, he ignored me, when i used my body language to explain that to him he just told me to fu** off ... ) Staff> i noticed that staff working there is totally not motivated and exhausted, since some of them work for 15 h strait on several different positions, they are always in mess and are not so eager to help in any issue (bringing new towels, calling taxi, giving directions) some of them do not speak English (mostly Turkish and Russian are languages of choice) overall > will not definitely go there again, hotel is overpriced, no service, (and no pool which they advertise in web page) hotel is located in famous Ku`dam, really steps away from KDW, very well connected with rest of the city from S and U station Zoologischegarten which is maybe 300 m away from hotel. rooms are small, oldish stile, yet very well kept and clean. mostly rooms overlook hotel garden so there is no noise from the street. Breakfast is just fantastic with variety of food rarely seen in hotels 4* in Germany. Some of hotel staff at reception is a bit arrogant but others are really great and helpful. i am positive that in same price range you could find even better hotels in same location for same price.","although i have been in Istanbul many times i could not believe that i will finish up in sleeping in this hotel.

The rooms are cozy, comfortable and the decoration show great harmony. I would definitely recommend it and will be back for my next visit to Istanbul. The Hotel is located in the center of the tourist area, but the area itself is only open for restaurants nothing much to do there and the shop around (except restaurants) close too early ! The Hotel rooms is too small, the t.v. set sucks ! the A/C in our room & and our friends room wasn't cooling enough ! after we complained it worked fine ! In both rooms you will only find 1 socket to plug in your charger, etc and the other one in the toilet ! Speaking of the toilet !! Don't except any amenities from them ! bring your own except the towel ! The shower tub is too small and you need to climb to get there !! and by the time you finish your shower ! you will find the floor wet ! The bar/fridge was empty in both rooms ! our room had no place to hung our cloths (or put them) as it was occupied by bed sheets =) The breakfast had nothing nice at all :S .. Take my advise and find a hotel in Taksim Square its worth everything in that lively area (open all nite long) An absolutely horrible hotel with no facilities. Horrible bathrooms , small rooms, Small and stupid television set. No room service facilities. Not even a basic restaurant. Not a very nice locality. Unfriendly Staff. The worst thing was the breakfast buffet.It was the worst ever. Nothing to nice to eat. Nobody should go to this cheap hotel.~ Was there for 7 days with my spouse. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Service was terrible and staff is rude and not helpful. Room was too small and not clean and bathroom could barely fit one grown man. TV was smaller then my cell phone and had only Turkish channels and internet was only available in the lobby. Breakfast was absolutely terrible and it was exactly same for whole 7 days (it's probably always the same) and if you want to bring yourself a breakfast to your room they will charge you 5$. Bar is more closed then open and too expensive if you bumped to it when is actually open. Terrace was also closed for the whole time. Housekeeping people just go trough your room and pick up some trash and that's it. It was just awful and it ruined our visit to Istanbul. Run away as far as you can from this Hotel. ÃÂ°t used to be a nice hotel. I stayed there the third time. But the last time was terrible. Very rude behaviors and disrespectful attitude. You can't even welcome a friend in your room for 5 minutes. They thing you are doing bad things in your room. I wont ever stay in Grand Emin Hotel or their brother hotels ""AYMA 1, AYMA 2"".",,,
Rajandani,1788051,"I stayed here for 2 nights as my flight into Sabiha International was arriving near midnight and I did not want to take chances with local taxis at that hour. Hotel is just outside the arrival at a distance of couple of minutes walk. As a matter of fact it is between passenger terminal and a VIP terminal. Hotel is modern and rooms are large with all modern amenities. Staff and service is great and very friendly. Hotel is clean and gives a very modern look. Everything in room works well. WiFi is available with password provided by hotel and it is surprisingly very fast and worked all the time. Breakfast spread was good and had large variety fruits, breads, cheese, salad and limited cooked variety. Hotel is also very moderately priced. One can even stay at this hotel and still do descent sightseeing and come back in the night. Hotel can call for local taxi from airport. Also airport is well connected to many other areas including Citry Centre (Taksim Square) by Havatas Bus service which is great. You are in city centre in just 12 TL. The service is great. The hotel is highly recommended I stayed here for 3 nights in March 12 and enjoyed every bit of my stay at this property. Hotel is very strategically located facing the Sea of Marmara. I stayed at sea facing room which was very large and bed was also very large, nice and comfortable. There is a cable connection for internet and it works and has a great speed. Rooms are well appointed. Rooms facing the sea are large whereas the other rooms are of regular size. All fittings in bath room are of great quality and service is excellent. Hotel food is equally great and has variety. Large lobby with many information displays. Ideal hotel for conventions. Sabiha International airport is just 15 minutes drive. Nearest shopping at Pendorya is 5 minutes drive. Hotel is highly recommended.","I stayed in the Green Park Pendik for a convention.Right from day one when we reached the Ataturk airport , it took us forever to reach the hotel.Reason : It is on the Asian side of Turkey and crossing the Bosphorus itself takes 1-2 hours. The hotel in itself is very good with well appointed rooms , tea coffee maker , electronic safe etc but the house keeping staff does not speak English.We asked for Milk powder sachets and toilet roll over the phone for two days but to no avail..finally I went down to reception to give the same in writing,Promptly I was presented with two towels the next day..so much so for written instructions All in all a good hotel and ideal for big conventions but if you have Turkey sight seeing on your wishlist , the best is to stay near Taksim square on the European side which is where the party is !! the convention centre was huge enough for a symposium and the sound/visual sheme was ok. the hotel bars were rich and the stuff was wwll educated.the rooms were really excellent and teh sea sight is so nice,the hotel is so close to the sea and you can see the marmara sea islands from the frontside rooms.(if you want to visit the islands too,you can reach the port of boats to islands so easyl about 10 minutes travel by a taxi,indeed.)

I definitely suggest this hotel for short-term visits in the Anatolian side of Istanbul. New, sterile hotel with big rooms. Below average restaurant in the hotel but good choices close by in Pendik. I was actually going for holidays in my aunt's place. But the plane i took could not land in UK as it was snowing heavily. So it landed in istanbul. The people in charge took us here. we were surprised with the place. It was awesome. The room,toilet,food,people there and even the surroundings were great. We stayed there for 2 nights and it was really a good place. I definitely will want to go there again one day. And just a reminder that there are no wi-fi in the room but can get it in the lobby. The sofas there are really comfortable too. Nice, large hotel, one of the biggest conference hotels in these parts of the world. Staff is nice, only thing is lack of the English language. Nice bistro, with tasty food, fantastic pub with good beer and football games. Overall, very pleasant stay.",,,
amysanford,1380457,"The staff were great here. The room was very clean and there was a cleaning service everyday. The room was absolutely tiny though. There was no room to move around as the literally took up the entire room. Half the door to the bathroom was blocked due to a bedside table. Also, the doors may as well as been made of paper. We were kept up a few nights due to talking and a tv in the reception. The hotel is in a great location, off the main drag but extremely close to the main attractions. If you don't mind having a room were you are shuffling around furniture to move its a good place. Unfortunately the small room got to me in the end. We arrived in Venice the night of the one day transit strike so getting to Lido was a little tricky. IF there are no strikes happening then the water buses run regular to Lido and is an easy transit. This hotel has was very cute and right on the water. It is also VERY conveniently located close to the water bus station. The room we were in was very spacious, we actually decided to book an extra night because we enjoyed it so much. The staff were very nice and the hotel was very clean. We ate only the standard breakfast in the hotel, which was nice, but did not have dinner. The hotel offered for us to take a 'factory tour' of a glass factory on Murano, it was nice but not much of a tour as it is more of a trip to a very expensive glass showroom. But the island of Murano was nice and there are cheaper stores along the canal. I can see this as a GREAT alternative to staying in the main parts of Venice. It was quiet and no large tourist groups or mobs of people about. I would stay here again if (and when) I return to Venice!","The hotel is nice; just next to the blue mosque (Sultanahmet mosque) and walking distance to Saint Sophie and Topkapi palace;The staff is friendly and helpful; We had the family room and is not very small as other travelers complained about; Still , there was a very small wardrobe and we had to leave our clothes on the suitcases.

It was close to all of the tourist spots, but not on the main street so it was quiet enough. Breakfast was good and plentiful. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. Our room was clean and cleaned daily quite well. I've lived in Istanbul, and traveled there before and this was by far the most pleasant stay I've had. I definitely recommend this hotel. The hotel indeed has a very good location - close to tourist destinations. And this is the only positive point. Incredibly small rooms like cells, bathrooms are the same size as toilets in aircrafts! Never met such rooms before in any other country. A double- room prepared for us (a couple) was on the 3rd floor, too tiny & tired with scuffed walls with awful view from the window. Next morning changed to another room on the 2nd floor - same picture, but better view to the street, however very noisy, could hear everything happening at the reception, on the stairs and in neighbour-rooms. Pictures on the booking sites do not reflect the real condition. I'd recommend the hotel for transit travellers for 1-2nights, not for holiday/leisure trips. Our stay at Istanbul Holiday Hotel could not have been better. My wife and I are retired and are definitely value seekers and this hotel was perfect for us. Comfortable and clean, elevator and very close (5 min. walk) to the historical sites; we could not of asked for more. We found excellent food at two different restraints just around the corner. Ergin and his staff took care of all our needs and the English spoken was excellent. On the negative side, the rooms are not large which was not a problem for us but for those who have excessive luggage it could cause some problems. The lack of internet accessibility is a bit inconvenient but Ergin help me find an internet cafÃÂ© close by. For those looking for value, clean rooms, and walking distance to the historical sites you will be well served here. We will definitely book this hotel again next time I arrived at the hotel at 2.00 in the morning, there were two members of staff on duty and one showed me to my room, where he checked all was in order. On other nights other people probably arrived at the same time but I was not disturbed. The hotel is in the shadow of the Blue Mosque and an easy walk to St Sopia, The Hippodrome, Topkapi and Sultanmet Tram Stop. Good breakfast with plenty to chose from. Very helpful staff, keen to give advice (within the limits of their English and my Turkish) about transport, post etc. The room was cleaned and serviced well each morning. I've paid double for much worse hotels in the UK Only small drawbacks-no safe and less important not much hanging space. The hotel is perfectly located just next to Haghia Sofia and very close to all monuments and good restaurants. Rooms are really small, could not open our luggage on the floor and when going to bathroom (no need to go anyvhere else, as you can reach all walls from bed) one of us had to stay in bed. Also a bit noisy during nights, as people walked by our door. But everything was clean, breakfast was not bad and staff was fine. Great view from rook terrace!",,,
Irina P,275770,"The hotel is easily accessible only with a car. The area is fenced, you can park without a problem. On the territory there are several two-storey houses with apartments. Apartments are not quite new, but for a few nights should be fine. There is a kitchen with everything you need. Outside of the wilderness. The nearest shops and restaurants far - need to go to the car. The hotel is located in the former West Berlin. Nearby is the famous shopping street - KurfÃ¼rstendamm. Directly opposite - the Berlin Zoo (which unfortunately did not go). Rooms at large, clean, comfortable. Large bathroom, extra toilet. The hotel has two restaurants. Many staff, if necessary, they are good help.","The apartment was great. Kitchen and sofa on the ground floor, bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. The bed was comfortable enough. The area is a bit out of Rome, but connected by bus and train to the city, so there are no problems. We arrived late, after 10pm, and it was no problem at all. The receptionist was very friendly. I liked the fact I was able to pay with my American Express. Internet was good. The apartment was very well heated which was important since we were there in early February. All in all it was a great stay and I'd stay there again when I come to Rome again. The hotel is easily accessible only with a car. The area is fenced, you can park without a problem.

Outside of the wilderness. The nearest shops and restaurants far - need to go to the car. We were there for 2 nights, though short but enjoyable and relaxing. It was a bit out of Rome, but we had rented a car, so it was OK. The walls seemed a little not-so-much sound proof. We were there with a baby, the stairs seemed a little not safe due to not having proper fence. The renting did not have a breakfast included but since there was a kitchen, we were fine with it. We were told that there was no late check-in, so we had to come to the residence by 8:00pm the first night. It seemed OK, since we already wanted to come there early. I used wired internet which cable was provided in the room. I am not sure if they had wireless internet too. Overall the residence seemed alright, and if we ever plan to stay in Rome, we will go there again.",,,
Mir929,258998,"I had been looking forward to going to Italy for quite a long time and was really excited when we finally decided to go there. The hotel was booked by our agents, who had never failed us before and I expected a 4 star experience. Before going, of course, I read the trip advisor contributions and was a bit intimidated. We had booked a triple room, which on arrival turned out to be a double room with an additional bed in front of the desk and TV and there was practically no room to even get to my side of the bed. This was the main drawback. The location is great, 50 metres from the Termini where there were a lot of places to eat and a shopping area. The room was cleaned every day, breakfast was OK, although the same every day but they had all we needed. The area is a bit rough in the evening. On our last night there was a big brawl in the Chinese restaurant opposite the hotel and the police had to intervene. Overall it was a nice stay, plenty of things to see. What I didn't like in general was the terrible infrastructure, the Metro is awful - a far cry from the Underground in London. I would recommend the hotel for the location and the nice and friendly staff but this is definitely NOT a 4-star hotel. What I also find absurd is the tourist tax that we had to pay at check-out - 3 more euro per person per night. Booked the hotel through the Internet and had no problem with the reservation. The absolute plus is the location - about 100 metres from Victoria Station and we found it very easily. We had a triple room - for me, my husband and daughter. The room was not very big but not very small either, which is not what I can say about the bathroom - very small, a bugger man would find it hard to turn around while having a shower. Since we were there in April, we were quite worried about the weather but it was great - sunny and almost no rain. The heating in the room was on all the time, so we didn't feel cold, just the opposite. The breakfast was the same every day but we didn't mind and the staff was really helpful.

Some of the other guests complained about the noise from the street but for me it was OK. The bathroom was really small but clean. The staff were friendly, answered all my questions. Breakfast was basic but enough. As a whole I would recommend it to people who are on a budget. The truth is, I only slept there. After all you don't go to Paris to stay in ahotel.","I had been looking forward to going to Italy for quite a long time and was really excited when we finally decided to go there.

What I also find absurd is the tourist tax that we had to pay at check-out - 3 more euro per person per night. I stayed in Hotel Luce for a week and everything went great! The hotel is really close to Termini station and other several public transport options. There are good and cheap restaurants nearby. The staff is helpful and the breakfast was pretty good too! My only critic is that we could sometimes hear other people talking next door, but nothing too disturbing. Just got back from staying at this hotel with my partner. The room was lovely and comfortable and very clean. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful and all spoke very good English. The hotel itself was less than a 5 min walk from the main train terminal. The only fault i had with the hotel was that there was nowhere to sit and get a drink when we got back in the evening, there were also no tea or coffee facilities in the room. My wife and IWent to Rome for our 30th anniversary. We caught the Leonardo express from the airport to the centre and hotel Luce is about 200 yards from the station. It is in an ideal location for the Metro or walking. Because it is near the station, it is easy to find. The staff were always helpful, the rooms comfortable and the breakfast is enough to keep you going. There are plenty of restaurants nearby offering reasonably priced menus, I'd recommend the fixed priced menus This hotel is situated a stone's throw away from Termini, which is the main train station, the bus terminus and where the Metro lines cross. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, covering all price ranges. The staff on reception are very friendly, speak perfect English, and do their best to sort out queries regarding sightseeing, transport, etc. The hotel is clean, the furnishings are old fashioned. The wardrobes are weird, incorporated into the headboard. The room (207) was small, with only one chair. The air conditioning was not very efficient, but better than nothing. My husband had a problem finding a news channel in English, but finally managed to find one on our last day. I'm, surprised at the 4 star rating considering there is a very limited choice for breakfast, which is the only meal they serve. There is only one person to clear the tables, replenish the cold buffet and wash up. She doesn't understand much English. The coffee in the machine is undrinkable, so we stuck to tea. This hotel benefits from a great location. It being our first visit to Rome we were unsure of the best area in which to stay so we went with the travel agents recommendation of being near the Termini station. He was right in that the location was great for exploring every part of Rome. We were also worried that the area might be noisy but it really wasn't, in fact once the windows were closed and even with the air con unit going we slept like babies! The room although small was clean and had all the necessary amenities. It was cleaned daily, towels changed and basic mini bar restocked. Breakfast was ok. Basic but fine as we filled ourselves up on Rome's other culinary delights whilst out and about. The one thing that really lets this hotel down is its staff!! They could not even raise a smile let alone engage in conversation. My boyfriend had learnt some Italian prior to our trip and was eager to try this out but gave up when all he was greeted with was the odd grunt. I'm just glad that we didn't need urgent help or advice as who knows the response we would have got! Any recommendation that I might give would be based solely on location and certainly not on service. An ok hotel but definitely not 4 star. Stayed at Luce hotel for 3 days in April during our touristic trip. Room was a really small, but nice designed and a very clear, with king-size comfy bed. Bathroom is enough spacious, bath-show cabin is a small, everything worked. Towels were changed every day; soap, shampoo refilled daily as well. Breakfast is a standard continental breakfast in Rome: jam, toasts, muesli, thin sliced cheese and ham, croissants and a very good coffee! It was enough for us to start a new day before to meet Rome sights. Hotel location is perfect, not in the center (25 min walk from Colosseum), but in 3 minutes walk away from the metro and railway station. Hotel is a good choice for touristic needs at reasonable price. Would be good to get a free Wi-Fi here. This hotel was fairly small but friendly and polite staff who could speak good english. The rooms were quite small as stated in previous reviews but unless planning to actually move into the room what more do you need? Beds were comfy and shower facilities were always nice and hot. Breakfast was only small selection but plenty for what you needed. Hotel was 2 mins walk from Roma Termini which was great location to jump on the Metro and go to the various sites in Rome. We used the Metro every day and found it very useful being so close after all the walking!! you will appreciate it. Overall, lovley small hotel if you are goin to Rome not wanting to spend a fortune. Didnt take away from the beauty of the city at all. Would deffinately stay here again when we return! We had a very good stay here. The rooms are clean if a little on the small side. Good bathroom and decent comfortable bed. No Air con in the bedrooms so when the windows were open it was rather noisy at times. Breakfast very basic but OK. (except for the coffee!) Excellent helpful, English speaking reception staff. The location is fine, just around the corner from the Termini station, where you can get the shuttle to the Airports or buses to all the major sights. We also easily walked into the centre of Rome on two occassions. Three or four good resturants/bars around the hotel BUT avoid going to the Trattoria Gemma Alla Lupa in the next road to the hotel - awful food, terrible service and they rip you off over the wine prices!! Very good hotel. The close personnel and a good breakfast. Little bit small numbers, but always pure bed and always fresh toilet accessories and towels. Very close to Train station Termini and the subway. It is convenient to reach any seat interesting you. Around it is a lot of small restaurants .When I shall in Rome necessarily I shall lodge in this hotel. Thanks for fine rest!!! Not really a 4 star by international standards. The rooms are quite small and there are no public rooms apart from a breakfast area. However, it is a great base for touring Rome if you are just looking for a reasonably priced comfortable room with breakfast facilities. The area is not the most salubrious but it is within 2 minutes walk of the main railway, metro station and the airport shuttle bus and also within reasonable walking distance of most of the main sights. Breakfast is reasonable and there is a little shop next door with most basic needs. All in all a good budget hotel. Will probably stay here again. Small and cozy hotel Luce is a short walk from the central railway station Termini. The rooms have everything necessary for comfortable rest after a busy day. Rooms are decorated in a beautiful old Italian style. Inside the rather large wardrobes and free safe. The main architectural monuments of Rome are in walking vicinity. The hotel is very clean, breakfast is modest, but not to stay hungry. The hotel has pleased us with its location near the Termini Station and all attractions. The hotel is very small, really small number, but everything worked properly, everything was clean. The rooms are nice. We walked all the time, so little room for the night we are not strained. At breakfast, walked only my friend, I already eat breakfast later. He said that breakfast is very good. The hotel is a bit pricey for its service. Whilst hotel doesn't compare to UK 4* it is very clean and comfortable. The hotel has everything you need for a short stay. Location is good for exploring the sites of rome. A nice restaurant is located next door. The airport drop off point is 1 minutes walk from the hotel. All the staff were extremely helpful and had excellent English.",,,
Bruno_Marinho,237155,"Huge rooms, great beds. No breakfest and a little far from the tour points. Difficult to find and the way there is dark and a little dangerous. No breakfast, rooms clean but small.","The rooms are clean and cosy albeit mine did not have an external window. I also missed a desk to write, but if you are here just for leisure it should not be an issue. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The price I paid was better than prices for hotels of similar quality and location. Difficult to find and the way there is dark and a little dangerous. No breakfast, rooms clean but small. Service - excellent. All staff were very friendly. Value - excellent. We booked on booking.com and got a great deal. Sleep Quality - good. Comfortable beds. Noise is a particular problem for light sleepers as other guests may come in quite late from 4-5am. Cleanliness - rooms and bathroom were clean but the bedsheets had clearly not been changed. When we arrived, we found hair strands all over the pillow covers and bedsheets but no stains. As it was late when we arrived, we had to just pick the hair off and deal with it. By the next morning, we weren't fussed anymore. Location - excellent. A couple of minutes walk to La Rambla. Felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night. Rooms - large, basic rooms that were bright and well designed, there was a window in the bedroom and bathroom (we stayed in a triple/quadruple room). No TV but expected for a 1 star. Free fast wi-fi. Travel tips - La Seu Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter (or known as the 'Gothic Cathedral') is a must see. Nearest metro station is Liceu and is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel - you can take the train to La Sagrada Familia (tickets should be purchased the day before to avoid the very long lines - this also applies to any other structures by Gaudi) and Park Guell. Port Vell and the beach is within walking distance of the hotel. Overall impressions - nice, comfortable stay. Great option for budget travelers. We would stay here again in the future. This is a very very basic hotel with windowless small rooms and fast wireless internet. No tv in room. It is clean and centrally located. However, the air stinks in the room and I would not want to be here for longer than 1 night. If you can get it for under 25 euro it is a deal. this 1 star hotel is located at the heart of central barcelona, in the Gothic quarter. rooms are very small and basic, and there's not enough fresh air around, but if you find a good deal for your stay the location is worth every euro. For our first visit in Barcelona we booked hotel call which was bargain for money,and we could spend our money on sightseeing and restaurants rather than for a room which we were gonna use to sleep and shower.I was a bit aware because of how cheap it was,but i would definately recommend it to somebody who goes to visit barcelona city.The hotel is right in heart of everything and walking distance from la ramplas and all bars and restaurant.Easy access to the tube as well.It looks dodgy and scary from outside,but the rooms are well clean(room service everyday),with safety box and quite new furnitures.If you dont expect luxury things,is the best to save your money and enjoy the centre of barcelona. I stayed at hotel Call for two nights and could not wait to get out of there! The staff was nice and the location is in the heart of the action but that's where the good stuff ends. There are no TV's in the rooms. Our room was on the 2nd floor but we felt like it was in the basement. The tiny window faced a dark alley and you couldn't open the blinds. The room was so hot we could barely sleep! Don't bother trying to charge your cell phone the only 2 outlets are all the way up by the ceiling! ANd the neighborhood was really sketchy at night. For the price I think you can find a much better hotel. I stayed there for 4 nights on my own, I had a double bed in a reasonable sized room, very bright, with a nice ensuit bathroom. The service was very very good, 24hrs reception, they keep the key for you when you leave the hotel so it is very safe. the location of the hotel is excellent! (near cathedral) Clean towels and new bedsheets are provided everyday. The 2 downsides would be that the sound proof of the rooms are not that great, so you can hear people along the hallway or going up and down the stairs quite well. Secondly, if you book a basic room for 1 (like mine) then you will only get a room without a window. Also, try not to wander around the streets after 10pm specially a girl only. Otherwise it was very pleasant staying with them! great value! As someone before me has said - location is everything, especially if all you need is a bed to crash and a bathroom to wash off the dirt of the street. Hotel Call offers accomodation at budget rates in a perfect location for those who visit Barcelona to explore the city rather than hang out in air-conditioned lonunges. In brief: the PROS are: location in the Barri - low price - friendly and polite reception (basic command of English proved just enough to avoid any misunderstandings) - air conditioning in rooms (though they sometimes turn it off for periods of anywhere from a quarter of an hour to an hour). The CONS are: thin walls - low average age of guests, who sometimes treat this place as a hostel and have to be reminded it is in fact a hotel - loud room service (late risers - DON'T take rooms 405, 406, 407, 408 - they are located next to the maintenance space). - lack of windows in rooms (yes, though in noisy Barcelona this just as well might be a blessing). The hotel is clean enough. As to the safe - i didn't use it, so it was not robbed, but we left a pricey digital camera in our room a couple of times and we still have it. I stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is OK for its value. The staff is very friendly and nice. The rooms are very clean. If I have to return someday I will consider this Hotel again.I stayed We've stayed for 4 nights, the hotel's location is great, very near the Liceu metro station, in some tiny streets full of shops. The room was good and clean and the staff was very nice and helpfull. For a 1 star hotel, I could not ask anything else. hotel call basic but clean, warm, comfortable and quiet. about 5 mins walk from la rambla great location",,,
SueSimpson292,224661,"We checked the reviews on this hotel after we had booked so arrived feeling rather anxious as to where we were staying.

Location to Paddington underground was excellent as literally no more than 5 mins walk. We checked out after breakfast on our last day & as our train was not booked til 7pm that evening we asked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel for the day which was no problem, for this we were really grateful.

Booked a triple room - given a tiny double room with 3 single beds, all pushed together to make one big bed. No floor space left for 3 people to move about. No mirror in bedroom, no plug near bathroom mirror to use hairdryer. Fan and main light in bathroom not working. Moved beds to try and create a walkway for middle bed - but draught from windows made it very uncomfortable. Poorest continental breakfast we have ever seen - sultry staff unhappy to see us at 9.15 as breakfast finished at 9.30. Would give it no rating - avoid !! My partner (now fiancee after our trip to London) booked us in advance to go to the Royal Cambridge- great location after getting the train and arriving in Paddington Station. The Pros end there. We were given our key to room 4- down in the basement- rooms were tired and worn- no room to swing a goldfish with only one plug socket- Tv not working- Noisy boiler room outside our window so couldnt open window for fresh air or get much sleep. To be fair it was reasonably clean......... but the worst was to come...... the breakfast!!!!! Well....... cold boiled eggs, cold congealed beans and dry sausages were on offer that had been sat there for a long time...... you did get to do your own toast so did have something warm....... but really very very poor..... the manager was reasonably nice..... but as for the other staff that stood outside the front door smoking most of the time and were very unhelpful!!!! Not a great way of promoting the hotel!!!! Yes it is cheap so i suppose you get what you pay for........ just dont be decieved by the photos as it doesnt look like that!!!!! oh and whoever it was slamming the doors at 2am could have been shot!!!..... then again at 6am when everyone was going to breakfast (next to our room) Luckily we didnt spend much time in our room but it did really spoil our stay :-( Run, don't walk, away from this hotel! Our room was so small we could barely turn around in it. It was not clean and smelled badly. The bathroom was horrible!! Turning a light switch on caused a fuse to blow and resulted in no electricity. When we asked for a different room we were told there was only one other room available and.....""it's worse that the one you have"" - that's a direct quote from the person at the reception desk. From the offset our stay at the Royal Cambridge was a pretty dismal. Corners of door-ways taped up and unfriendly manor welcomed us. Our first bedroom, was underground with no ventilation, the air-con did not work, the cleanliness was very poor, the carpet certainly hadn't been hovered and stray hairs were left around on table tops. After a flooding in our bathroom, after a shower (one of the sliding shower doors, were missing!) we asked for a ""upgrade"" our customer service was on the border of hilarious. But they kindly did move us, to a slightly better room. Still our quality of sleep was minimal (it was snowing outside, yet felt like you were in the tropics in the bedroom!). All topped off by a really unfriendly, almost comedy act of a breakfast. We gave our key in at check out and were glad to of only stayed one night. Sorry for this to be so rudely reviewed but i seriously had no idea that these kind of hotels were still out there, or even survived the 90's! Brush up on your customer service, and don't let the handy man do the plumbing, electrics and decorating!! Very strategic location, near all the attractions. Clean, comfortable beds. Decent breakfast. This is an awful hotel, with dirty bedding and a dirty bathroom (mould and all) . The room was tiny, and the heating was off. The breakfast was a joke, served in a basement. I just wanted to get out of it. At ÃÂ£96 for the night it was a rip off I wasn't intending to spend much time in the room so just wanted a clean room, comfortable bed and a decent shower. Got all 3. Stayed on the ground floor so didn't have the issue with stairs others have mentioned. Breakfast bog standard. Got woken fairly early - thin walls, but for a room for the night did the job, bearing in mind it would cost me 2-3 times the amount to stay in a chain hotel. Booked this hotel for a friend's hen weekend because it was cheap and it was near public transport links (Paddington main line and tubes 5 min walk away). Thank goodness the group of us only stayed one night. On checking in we were told that if we wanted to pay by credit card there would be a 7% charge - despite one of the group checking before we booked. One group were in Room 2 - very small, very noisy and with very few things working. For those of us on the 3rd and 4th floor - the rooms were a very good size. One double bed and two adult sized beds. The rooms were reasonably clean however that is the best you can say. Wiring was coming out of the bathrooms, TV did not work, no milk with the tea tray or fridge to keep things cool. The rooms were stiffiling hot as well - very little air got through the windows. You can only imagine my dismay the following morning after an uncomfortable hot night to find the shower did not work. My advice to anyone booking is that the people are pleasent enough but don't expect much in the way of value or quality. Even Travelodge is better than this. The room was very clean and the bed was good. The pillow wasnÃÂ´t that good very thin good location for bus and Underground (dont take the Tube very expensive) shower wasnt great btu for people who are only staying to sleep its a perfect hotel (Y) Dont expect to much and its a fine hotel Had prebooked 2 nights stay as thought the location and website looked good. One night was enough! Old, run down, disgusting! Just foregoed the expense and paid for somewhere else for 2nd night. Room for 3 was so tiny - no space for luggage except closed up in the cupboard. The room was 2 single beds long with a small cupboard at end of beds, and 2 single beds wide. Kid you not!! Dirty towels in the extremely tiny bathroom when arrived, shower water leaked all over bathroom floor. Noisy air conditioner, couldn't sleep. Room was down in the basement next to the stair well and dirty linen bags under the stairs with entry to the breakfast area. Breakfast a lot to be desired - cheese and bread slices looked several days old spaced out on tray. Did not feel safe there. Definitely don't go there regardless of the location. Far better places to stay. Hotel is great for access to underground- just down the road. Didnt have high expectations as its a cheap hotel but we were very unimpressed. Small room with only window overlooking corridor but did have aircon, bathroom clean but very tired and no shower gel provided. Also no iron or hairdrier and the only mirror was in the bathroom so 2 girls trying to get ready at once was tricky. Breakfast only served till 9.30 and only choice was cereal with warm milk or toast and cold hard boiled eggs. no fresh coffee but there was warm orange juice!! worst breakfast ever- I was actually ill afterwards.",,,
Brenda S,676573,"Let me first start off by saying the man behind the desk was extremely friendly and helpful to us. Now that I've said that, the hotel was dumpy!! Our air conditioner froze, so we were told to open the window, which we did, but closed it immediately because there was no screen. The manager was nice enough to bring us a fan. The furniture was old and cheap. The bathroom was very small. There was no elevator, luckily we were on the second floor, we only had to go up one flight of stairs, we had heavy luggage. The breakfast room was a closet. Parking was horrible. I would not recommend this hotel, unless you are desperate!! Check in not impressed went to room bathroom toilet was used with a bowl movement had to call housekeeping thought the toilet was going to overflow after he fixes with a plunger they didnt even reclean the batroom the room has bad hadn't been renavated ian least 10 years or more was not a good stay stay away should have spent more money to stay at a better place staff and service and place was aweful Returned for another weekend getaway, this time bringing friends. Once again, enjoyed our stayed. Lovely room with view of English Bay. Considering that this is a perfect ocean location, the hotel does not overcharge, for the rooms or the food & beverage. Brunch was wonderful. We were extremely lucky to have the same waiter we did when we stayed in Oct...Izad was once again very attentive, funny and it was a pleasure seeing him again. Our friends really enjoyed the morning with him as our server. Special thank you to Rick for my birthday upgrade and for taking care of our reservations and answering all our questions. See you again soon. Maybe this time with our boys to watch the fireworks in the summer. thanks again. two couples from the subhurbs. My husband and I stayed at the Sylvia before we had children. We live just outside Vancouver (Port Coquitlam) and we decided to treat ourselves to a night out (after 19 yrs) and made a reservation. We told the reservationl clerk that this was a special weekend for us and would really like an ocean room (none were available). I asked that if one became available, we would love to be upgraded. Upon check in, we were surprised to have been given a wonderful partial ocean view room on the 6th floor. We had a wonderful stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast on Sunday was also great. Our waiter, Ized, was very funny, a gifted server and was attentive to our needs. He added a personal touch by asking us about our stay and why we were away for the weekend. His personal touch and humour added to our enjoyable stay and our breakfast experience. The location of the hotel is perfect, as we parked our car and didn't use it until we checked out. There are alot of hotels in Vancouver, but if you are looking for the oceanside, walks in Stanley Park, or shopping along Denman or Robson, this hotel is the perfect location. We will definately be back and next time, we will be bring our friends.Thanks for a great weekend! I don't go to a city for its hotel - but everything about this hotel makes me want to return. The owner Nathalie couldn't have been kinder or more helpful. The whole hotel has been newly renovated and everything is chic and clean. The breakfast room is superb and overlooks the canal. The dutch pancakes that Nathalie cooked up were wonderful and she does everything she can to make your stay pleasurable. She loves her life's work - running a hotel - and you can see it in everything that this hotel has to offer. The location is great - if there is a room available don't hesitate to book it.","When we walked in my disappointment was very evident to my partner who had left the hotel booking to me. The expectations we had were of a 3 star hotel, but in fact it turned out to be a lowest class motel. Having said that, the bed was comfortable, and the room was clean. Breakfast was very basic, set up in a small basement room. The coffee was extremely watery. We checked out a day early (of course no refund!) because we felt uneasy with some of the persons who were hanging around in front of the hotel the night we arrived. We won't stay there again. Let me first start off by saying the man behind the desk was extremely friendly and helpful to us. Now that I've said that, the hotel was dumpy!! Our air conditioner froze, so we were told to open the window, which we did, but closed it immediately because there was no screen. The manager was nice enough to bring us a fan. The furniture was old and cheap. The bathroom was very small. There was no elevator, luckily we were on the second floor, we only had to go up one flight of stairs, we had heavy luggage. The breakfast room was a closet. Parking was horrible. I would not recommend this hotel, unless you are desperate!! The service are ok. No coffee machine or tea. Decor is poor and equipments are broken..lamps, sofa and the bed. Wall in the bathroom need renovation because of the humidity. The parking area is NONE and got to pay for parking on the street. It was certainly an hotel for a renting hour per hour. Hotel price is 60,00$ / night ... and I know that we can find for the same price a proper, clean places to stay for the same cost. I was a shamed to see that some hotels are just making promotions on expedia and so on to get visitors and make money out of them. NOT RECOMMENDED. Do not do the same mistake as we did. Fairly clean, good location for just lingering in Montreal but not for seeing the major sites (bit far from the main drag and Old Montreal). Unfortunately, we went during the Jazz Fest/Canada Day weekend so our prices were quite high but I'm told the off-season prices are great. But it seemed to be one of the more affordable hotels with 2 queen beds in Central Montreal on that weekend. Staff is great. The place has some quirky charm like a creaky European urban hotel. Breakfast is pretty mediocre. Rooms are fairly comfortable and clean but there was a bit of a lingering odor of smoke and orange cleanser from a by-gone era as a smoking room. Bathroom was clean and functional. It's nice and close to the Plateau neighborhood and the famous St. Laurent and St. Denis areas. Great restaurants and funky shops. If you want to go the St. Cat drag or Old Montreal, you'll likely want to cab (about $8 to $10). Parking's minimal an you need to reserve a spot well ahead of time. If I had no other options, I'd gladly stay hear again ... but I've always been able to find other options. This occasion was just a bit odd due to the Jazz Fest. Great value but the hotel is a bit old....no elevator. If you dont want to spend more than you have to then this is the place",,,
LinasReview,78152,"When I arrived at this LQ hotel, I was a bit apprehensive. The location is right off the freeway, I-15. There were some questionable folks parked in the back parking lot.

The continental breakfast was not the best. There is an I-Hop, Starbucks, and Mexican Restaurant right there.

This one is very nice and new, and has their wonderful pillow top beds with great pillows, nice 32 inch flat screen TV. It is very well furnished and spotlessly clean. My room was on the side facing the freeway, but with the thick walls I really couldn't hear a thing from the road. Check in was quick and efficient. The rooms are nice and spacious, great soft chair to sit in and watch some games on TV, nice desk and chair. Breakfast is typical continental breakfast - same as most La Quintas. The only real drawback for visitors to San Diego is that the location is about 20 minutes (north) from most of San Diego. If you are doing things in the northern SD area, it should be great for you. Overall, nice, quiet, clean, and comfortable. The staff is very nice and very helpful. Overall, a great value for the money - better than you'll get most other places in the area.

IHOP and starbucks are next door and across the street a mc'donalds, subway and a pizza joint. the breakfast area was narrow and the seating limited. i wished they had the waffle making machine instead of frozen waffles; but with the limited counter space i can understand the reasoning. if you can't find something to eat you just aren't hungry. staff was friendly, parking was plentiful, rooms have been updated, limited tv channels, wi-fi connected easily, price was right.",,,

Took payment off the card without asking ! as paying a different method or planned to ! That tired checked out early so could get home to bed to get a decent nights sleep - after paying ÃÂ£49.00 for a sleepless night not atall impressed. I use to love this place but since its changed hands, its gone downhill quickly and the prices have gone up, They take people from councils in etc who are nosiy running up and down the corridors throughout the night, banging doors, police sirens are a nightmare.Its cheap but thats all i can say about this, quite shocking to be honest. Appauling, room was dirty, the commual toilet, sink and shower was broken as usual have reported it several times. People running up / down the corridor all through out the night - I was that annoyed that i checked out at 7am on a sunday. The place is a shambles.............................................

I can't iterate enough about this place but DO NOT EVEN THINK OF STAYING HERE i booked this to stay overnight for a wedding and after arriving i started to have second thoughts.Once shown my room they were confirmed....small,dingy,dirty and smelt of god knows what.I imediatly booked out again and would urge anyone not to even consider getting as far as i did into the hotel I arrived midday with my Son & two grandaughters, we booked a quad room, We knew the room would consist of a double bed (shared by the grandchildren) & two single beds, the room (20) looked reasonably clean, small but sufficient! I noticed a few things that were not quite right, firstly the only light switch was by the door, so once in bed there was no way of turning the light off without getting out of bed as there was no bedside lighting provided, also the room was for four people yet there were only three towels, three cups & three drinking glasses! We had booked the room so we could stay over for the night whilst we made a first time visit to watch West Ham, upton park is approximately a 20 minute walk away, after watching the football we found it near impossible to find an eatery where we felt comforable with the children, we walked in every direction to locate something other than a fast food establishment, not even a pizza hut or weatherspoons in sight! so we had to eat in the local KFC. I tried to have a shower in the morning after an uncomfortable nights sleep, the room was very noisy with police sirens going all night (Police station is located opposite the Hotel), the shower was impressive to look at, but was a nightmare to get right! the water was a mere trickle and very hot or very cold, it was extremely difficult to find a medium setting! We left after breakfast as planned, no problems with the food, plenty of toast, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages etc etc. (Cold Coffee though) Since arriving home my son & I have both discovered that we have been bitten badly by bed bugs or fleas, I am now constantly itching & scratching...... my original thoughts was that the hotel was ok for the cost, however, given the poor facilities & the persistent scratching I would not use this hotel again, I would happily pay an extra Â£20-Â£30 to stay somewhere a bit better than this flea-pit! Myself and my Manager arrived at this hotel and was horrifed from the first moment we saw it. I was hoping to god there was a mistake and we had arrived at the wrong hotel. We parked up the car and went inside to find we were greeted by a young man. He checked us both in. He had pointed out where my manager's room was but took me outside the building next door to what can only be described as a council house/flat. He opened the door to thr house/flat and then inserted a key into a shared access door. Behind the door were 4 bedroom doors and a communal bathroom. He gave me the key to my door where i found a bed a shower a tele and a very large spider. My natural reaction was to sit on my bed and think 'is this a joke'. Myself and my manager spent approx an hour ringing round hotels near by and were willing to spend ÃÂ£180 on a room for 1 night, this was not an option as all hotels nearby seemed to have been fully booked. I informed the receptionist that i was not happy staying in the room as i knew 3 men were staying next door to me and could easily get into my room. The receptionist kindly put me into another room in the same building as my manager. Again this was awful. The sheets were dirty, the bathroom was dirty. Down the side of the bed i was horrified to find newspapers,labels,sweets,wrappers. I slept with my light on all night and had around 4 hours sleep. In the morning i bravely attempted to use the kettle. I washed the kettle round with water and poured out to find the kettle and made the water go brown!!!. I wouldnt wish for my worst enemy to stay here!! My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for the night as it was 5 miles from the O2, the first impressions of the room and bathroom were quite nice however when i went to have a shower the water was coming out freezing and there was a smell of what can only be described as a dirty fish tank / sewage smell coming from the shower. The shower also wasn't draining either, my boyfriend went to reception to complain, a man who could hardly speak English came up to the room to unblock the shower which made the smell even worse and the dirt, hair and other deposits that came out of the shower plug were disgusting, when we advised him of the nasty smell coming out the shower his answer was to bring us a bottle of nasty smelling air freshener, he also persisted to say that the water was warm when it clearly wasn't, we also had to ask him for the TV remote which for some strange reason was at reception he seemed very reluctant for us to have it. The attitude from him was that he didnt care either. It so gross i ended up washing my hair in the sink and couldn't even close the toilet door to use the loo as the smell was so bad. We could hear noise from the other rooms as well, people walking up the corridors and moving about upstairs, we had to keep the toilet door shut all night to make sure that fish tank smell didnt come in the room, It was a very lucky thing that we actually missed breakfast the next morning as i cant imagine what that would have been like. Again went to wash my hair in the sink the next morning as the thought of even touching that shower made me feel sick the water again was freezing, we couldn't check out quicker and def wouldn't be coming back. if you are thinking of staying in a hotel down this road please make sure you dont stay at this one. We booked to stay at this hotel for a trip to London and the o2 arena, on arrival we were placed into an adjoining building which contained 4 flats, we stayed in flat 2, the place was absolutley disgusting and if you given this as your room I would avoid at all costs! There was 1 bath towel per couple, 1 tea cup per room, 2 tv's but no remote, the bathrooms had an overpowering smell of sewage and was generally very unpleasant, it wad dirty, the decorating hadn't been finished, tiles were missing from the shower unit. If you want a nice relaxing night this is not the place to stay, the sirens from the emergency vehicels went on all night, police, ambulance etc etc didn't stop until 5am and then it only stopped for 10 minutes!! No sleep at all!! To top it off after having no sleep i thought a quick shower to freshen me up........but NO hot water, so we left. I would avoid this hotel at all costs, it may be cheap but for the sake of an extra ÃÂ£20 I would definitely stay elsewhere!! working on westfield stayed 12 months with work all summer got bit by fleas and winter bed bugs and rats in rooms one of are workers got bit so bad he needed doctors myself was bit i told the staff wast of time not understand i reported them to the food was not good eggs rock hard and room was flooded a lot of times toilet overflowing and showers above leaking never again Now look guys, I never write hotel reviews online, but I feel I have to duty to let everyone how this hotel kindda cheats you for your money. I paid 55 pounds for a twin room which I booked for myself for one nights stay. Upon arrival they requestd me to go for a double room since I was alone. I agreed on good faith. But they put me in the worlds worst possible room. It had a window adjecent to the laundry room, it smelled like crap and there was no air circulation. When I told them that I didnt like the room and wanted my original room back, they refused to change my room. I couldnt stay in the room as I was having problems breathing so I went out immediately after taking a shower. Then I had to sleep over at a friends house because I couldnt breath inside the room. It was the WORST ever room I stayed in. Appauling, room was dirty, the commual toilet, sink and shower was broken as usual have reported it several times. People running up / down the corridor all through out the night - I was that annoyed that i checked out at 7am on a sunday. The place is a shambles.............................................",,,
Belvederian,2516043,"Stayed here for 2 nights in February 2012. Overall excellent facility for the business traveler. Room was fine (was concerned what room I'd get since I booked through Priceline). Service was good. Stayed here for 2 nights in February 2012. Overall excellent facility for the business traveler. Room was fine (was concerned what room I'd get since I booked through Priceline). Service was good. Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. Marriott Gold floor was very nice. Room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was good. Lobby area is clean and inviting. Parking was fine. Had early flight to East Coast. Excellent lobby features - clean, open, lots of flat screen TVs. Free wireless everywhere. No Marriott Gold floor. Also, no full service restaurant. So I hiked the quarter mile to the Marriott down Centrury. Quite room overall. Very, very good, prompt, friendly service. Shuttle to LAX was fine. Valet parking worked fine. Reviewer who commented on the annoying fountain was right - it's annoying (and possibly smelly).","Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. Marriott Gold floor was very nice. Room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was good. Lobby area is clean and inviting. Parking was fine. it was very quiet and kept well.the maid service was verr good.i enjoyed ny time in california very much. I visited family in Sherman Oaks and researched the area for a hotel with an ADA accessible room with roll in shower (wheel-chair) for other family members coming from NY. The hotel staff and concierge -Donald- were very patient with all my phone calls and questions. The ADA room has 2 queens and big bathroom with bars and the roll-in shower with fold down seat. My daughter and i has a 2 room suite, king bed with sofa bed. The king is very comfortable, sofa bed good enough for one adult or 2 kids. The suite has a seating area perfect for 6 adults and 2 babies visiting all day. Restaurant is decent but a bit limited. We requested --and got--a microwave. Coffeemaker in the room is like the Hamilton Beach personal pod brewer, i brought Senseo pods from home and they worked fine. Rooms have a balcony with interesting views of the mountains and freeways, doors are sealed for safety and noise reduction. Nice pool/spa area with fire pit and tables. On Ventura Blvd,.lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance, also a bus route. Parking is $15 day for guests, reasonable for this area. We really liked this hotel--comfortable, clean, attractive, quiet. I would stay there again for sure. Stayed overnight at the Courtyard at Sherman Oaks on Oscar weekend, when everything in Hollywood and the Westside seemed to be booked. The rooms are a little small but very clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds. Double glass doors kept out 95% of the racket from the Ventura Freeway screaming along eight stories below. The location is convenient to the Studio City-Universal Studios area, and the Westside is just a short hop back down the San Diego Freeway. There are plenty of eateries a 2-block walk away at the Galleria. Compared to similar properties in the general area, it's convenient and a good value. I stayed here for 8 nights for a business trip, and this was perfect for an extended stay. It was located 2 miles from my place of business so it was great to be so close. On my last trip to Sherman Oaks, this hotel had not yet opened, so I was obliged to stay in Universal City - the long commutes on I-405 made me feel as though I was back in NYC, ugh. This hotel is immaculate and service is excellent; very helpful and courteous staff who go that extra mile. The full-service restaurant was very good; the menu had the standard hotel fare but included some original dishes that were very tasty. My room had a small sitting area and a large desk area; free wi-fi was included. Nice large screen HDTV. This property is convenient to I-405 and 101 freeways; two blocks away is the Sherman Oaks Galleria with shops, food courts, movie theatres and the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory :) I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here on my next trip out west. This relatively small Marriott property, is very well maintained, and the staff is very professional. They were very friendly, yet professional and proper. The staff exudes respect for guests, and are very accommodating. By the way, there is absolute quiet, as you sleep in this business city. If you need to get to UCLA, the Getty Center, Century City, this is as convenient as you can get. Directly off the San Diego Freeway, but once you're there, it's very quiet. Big parking in the back. Everything is new and nice here. Pool and hot tub in the back courtyard. First, being a Starwoods member, I was skeptical of staying at a Courtyard, but I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The hotel is conveniently located near the 405 & 101 in the valley & is about 15 minutes away from Sunset Blvd. Ventura Blvd is just down the block & there are many restaurants in the area. In reading the reviews, I was concerned about quietness. We stayed on the 10th floor & since the sliding doors/windows were double-paned, we had no issues with noise. The sound from the air conditioning unit was noticeable, but was not more noisy then most hotels I've stayed at. The beds were very comfortable, the room was clean, & the bathroom was a decent size. The front desk lady, Gema, was very professional & check-in was very easy. The hotel had also noted my request for a quieter room and also accommodated my request for a late check-out. The hotel does charge $15 for parking, but it is in a secured lot, with in and out privileges. I would not hesitate to stay here again for the convenience & service. we had to stay overnight in the sherman oaks area of Los Angeles and found this marriott. i cannot say enough nice things about it. from front desk staff to the manager and parking attendant, everyone was so friendly, warm and welcoming. very nice room and comfortable bed and free perks including free delicious coffee int he lobby and cookies at checkin. thecmanager easily straightened out a booking error and couldn't have been more professional. highly recommended. also, very conveniently located to freeway, getty, skirball, etc. I had read several reviews and was concerned about the noise. I'm a light sleeper so this is always one of my main criteria. I stayed on the 6th floor, away from the freeway but Ventura is a very loud street. This affected my sleeping. The hotel itself has been newly decocorated in a very attractive modern style and the bed was quite good. The fitness center was not in great repair. One machine was missing the TV screen and the audio output wasn't working in the other. I changed to a different hotel for my next visit due to these problems. In town visiting friends was very convienant and located right off the 405. I did not notice any noise in the room I had from the Freeway. Parking was ample and the parking rate was resonable. Rooms were comfortable and the hotel seemed generally well maintained. Staff was friendly. Serveral good restaurants within easy walking distance. I stay at this hotel on a regular basis during our work trips to Van Nuys. Reasons this hotel is great: - The rooms are lovely. Very clean and the bed are super comfortable. - The internet is very fast and FREE for hotel guests. - The hotel is walking distance to the Sherman Oaks Galleria, so there are plenty of restaurants, etc. close by. - The staff is very friendly and helpful. Only cons: - The food in the hotel restaurant is very pricey -- but, that isto be expected. The coffee is free for guests in the morning, but not if you dine in and your server brings it to you. - Some of my colleages have said they can hear traffic from the freeway, but I have never had a problem. I stayed here with a mate and excluding the fire alarm that was pulled by a pissed off guest after they were being evicted at 3 AM, it was perfect. It is clean and hip and looks like they handle the guest flow perfectly. I never waited in line for anything and they were always ready to serve. There is plenty of street parking, so i would avoid the parking charge. I've stayed at well over 50 Courtyards around the world and this is one to remember! Nothing but good things to say about this hotel on Ventura Boulevard....It has a dated exterior but that's where the nitpicking ends. The room was clean with modern conveniences....The bed was very comfortable and we had plenty of room for our 11-month-old's portable playpen. The staff was friendly and quite responsive.. We normally run away from hotel restaurants (for a number of reasons) but this one pulled us in......The FOOD IS FANTASTIC...Breakfast,lunch or dinner. You know you're doing well when locals drop by to eat. You can't beat the location...open the door and the popular Ventura Boulevard awaits Our first time at a Courtyard was a wonderful surprise. This particular branch was apparently used as a prototype to redesign Courtyards to have a more urban chic style. The result is great. The lobby and lounge are stunning with understated, modern design. The rooms are simpler, but comfortable, clean, modern, and spacious. The hotel is safe, with an inside, free parking area, and you have to use your room key to use the elevator. Breakfast is much cheaper than at Marriott, and at least as good. The staff is phenomenal. Mike, the front desk manager, and the rest of the front desk staff, were not just friendly and helpful with retrieving our lost luggage, they were genuinely enthusiastic and passionate about their unique Courtyard. From the bartender to the breakfast waitresses, all staff were great. We thank all of them for a great stay. They really made a difference. If we are ever back in the area, weâll stay here again. Nice hotel.. but food is costly. staff is courteous.. but rooms were not that great... This hotel is a surprise- the lobby and rooms are very chic and modern. We managed to arrive late enough to park at the street meters beside the hotel and avoid $15 garage fee. This hotel is easy walk (2 blocks?) to Galleria outdoor mall (Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs). We stayed here after a day at Universal and it was a great place to wind down, walk to dinner, and do a little shopping. Had to call twice for a roll away bed but that was only hitch. Free coffee and $2 muffins in on-site cafe for quick breakfast.",,,

It is very well located, quiet (on a one way street), 1 minute walk to nearest metro (Maubert Matualite) lots of cafes and restaurants, a supermarket and laundry nearby. We stayed 6 nights and found to staff to be friendly and professional. They spoke English but were patient and encouraging when we attempted to converse in our limited French. Our room had a street view with the Pantheon up the road and Bd. Saint-Germain at the other end. Very easy to walk to Notre Dame just across the river. They have free internet access and can organise an airport shuttle. We plan to stay again on our next trip to Paris. A nice budget hotel not to be in during the month of July: too hot, without air conditioning. Stayed here on the last leg of our Europe trip from a recommendation of friends and we loved it! Staff we so lovely and helpful, area was beautiful to walk around, 5 mins from Notre Dame. Stayed in a Superior room with a street view, and it was very roomy and comfortable! Very quiet at night for a comfortable sleep. Overall a great stay! This was our second stay at this hotel since the first in October 2009 and once again we were very impressed with the cleanliness, friendliness of the staff and the great location. All I want from a hotel is is a clean, quiet, comfortable room and I had all of these at Hotel des Carmes. I don't stay at hotels for the view as I would rather be out there enjoying it but our 5th floor room did have a great view from the balcony of the Pantheon up the hill to the south and the top of Notre Dame behind the shops to the north. The bathroom was excellent, air conditioning in the room for when the weather warms up and a small lift to save your legs on the stairs. Good value breakfasts at only 6â¬. I spent 7 nights in late Sept. 2010 and was absolutly charmed. The staff was very friendly and helpful from the receptionist to the cleaning ladies. Luc was able to give all kinds of interesting info on places to visit. The location could not be better: 5mn walking to Notre-Dame, no more than 10 mn to the Jardin du Luxembourg and the RER is less than 10mn walk to the hotel. The street is quiet and if you want more quiet you can ask for a room on the interior. A 2 star hotel worth 5 stars. Louise from Saint-Sauveur. Excellent 2 Star HÃ´tel with 5 Star Service in heart of Paris ! Thanks to Trip Advisor, I discovered this excellent and comfortable hÃ´tel in the heart of the Latin Quarter, located 1 minutes from the Pantheon and a quick walk down the hill to Boulevard St. Germain and metro Maubert MutualitÃ© or a 7 minute walk from metro St. Michel. It's also close to the Seine, MusÃ©e de Cluny, Notre Dame, l'Institut Arabe, many affordable restaurants and cafÃ©s and practical conveniences including a stationery shop, small grocers (right on the rue des Carmes) dry cleaner, laundromat, phone store, pharmacie, banks, post office, (7 min walk on the rue des Ecoles) and much more. Markets are held by the metro Maubert MutualitÃ© several mornings a week and sell various things: flowers, foods,cheese, nuts, as well as a variety of scarves (great light gifts) and clothing, The best thing (beyond the fine location) about the hotel which put ""the icing on the cake"" was the wonderful staff who worked hard to make sure our needs were met and made many helpful suggestions to us, which enhanced our trip and helped us get to and fro locations, including the airport, efficiently. Their superb reputation, already recorded in Trip Advisor, led me to try the hÃ´tel and I was not disappointed. Whether or not you spoke French was no problem and the staff all tried hard to make sure we were having a happy and comfortable stay. They also had a little fridge which we used quite often to store perishable food (e.g. for picnics) A simple breakfast of coffee or tea with bread and croissant and jam is offered for an additional supplement. The rooms are comfortably furnished in a practical style and very clean - beds are comfortable and our double had a clean and pleasant bathroom equipped with a large bathtub and separate toilet. Both my friend and I slept well there and our room on the courtyard was quiet most of the time, with occasional possiblilites for eavesdropping on noise from other guests living on the courtyard. I would definitely stay at the HÃ´tel des Carmes if I can get a room, be sure to reserve ahead, esp in holiday periods, they are quite popular ! a few metres from teh metro makes this a really attractive hotel. nothing really stands out about it, but it was quite cheap, the staff were friendly and i really liked the location. Be warned, if you're offered Room 1 on the bottom floor (even though it goes at a cheaper rate), you wont sleep a wink. Other rooms are perfect though. The Hotel des Carmes exceeded our expectations. We've stayed nearby for several times the price, or paid twice as much in despicable lodgings. Four nights at the HDC and we were delighted with the deal. The HDC is not only a bargain, it's a genuine pleasure. The staff were warm, helpful, forgiving of our faults and attentive to our needs. We were lucky to have the night man schedule our shuttle to CDG which went flawlessly on the day we left. The HDC is convenient, close to a Metro stop, on an historic rue that looks up at the PanthÃ©on, in a very cool neighborhood. What's not to like? There are even low-price, take-out establishments in the block that will save you money if you want to pique-nique or eat pizza and sip cheap wine in your room. I have nothing to say but good things for these folks. Hotel des Carmes. Six Ã©toiles, if only they were allowed. ;-) My wife and I stayed the first few days in May. Our travel was based on the tripadvisor reviews as well as the location of the property. We were incredibly pleased at the location of the hotel. We couldnt of asked for anything better for the price. The rooms were small, but expected so didnt dissapoint at all. Everything was clean, great staff, very helpful. There is a little Italian restaurant if you turn left out of the hotel, that was fantastic for the price. We absolutely loved it there. We would absolutely recommend staying here for anyone sacrificing room size for location. We were able to book 2 rooms for 4 nights for 760 Euros. This is a wonderful little hotel in a great location. Easy access to the metro (Maubert station) and RER (St. Michel/Notre Dame). Minutes from Notre Dame, St. Chappelle and Ile de St. Louis. Walking distance to the Louvre and Jardin des Tuileries. Close to Boulanger Patissier (about 3 houses away) and an internet cafe (milk). We were able to check in early and leave our bags in the lobby. When we returned from a day of sightseeing, our bags were still in the lobby. The elevator was small, but easily fit a family of 4 with our luggage). The rooms were basic, but quiet and comfortable. The bed was a little on the firm side and the covers a little thin and worn (think holiday inn/motel quality). The temperature could be easly control via a panel in the room.",,,
hawksblue,253306,"I stayed here when I was in a pinch (flight canceled and rebooked the following day). I was just looking for a basic place to lay my head for the short night and Jet Motel was exactly what I needed. I didn't have much with me as my check-in luggage was still at the airport. The clerk was helpful in directing me to a local convenience store down the way to grab some essentials. I had a good night's sleep and they got me back to the airport on time. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good value in the airport area, all the other places I looked at were much more expensive. This is the absolute worst quality Westin I've ever seen. The room had a terrible layout. The entry-way to my ""superior"" suite was literally about 15 inches wide. Not even a modest-sized carryon bag can fit through there without lifting and twisting. I saw one of the other rooms and it was okay, but unless you know what you're in for, you might get stuck with such an atrocious setup. Another colleague of mine with the same unfortunate layout had a room where the lights didn't work. We brought these things up to the staff and they were apathetic and unhelpful - also very uncharacteristic of a Westin/Starwood hotel. I asked to be contacted by the GM, because no staff members seemed to care about these and other issues and never heard back. I would never stay here again. Oh, parking is $30 for a tight/cramped garage and wifi is not free, even for elite starwood guests. There are many nice hotels in Vancouver to choose from, don't stay here. My friends and I wanted to enjoy a New Years Eve at the W Hotel lounge and so we booked a couple of their ""Cool Corner"" suites and invited folks to come join us. From the moment of check-in I was greeted with rudeness by the hotel staff there, which is completely uncharacteristic of Starwood hotels. In particular, the ""Guest Service Manager"" Brian B. was about as friendly as your average Kinko's worker (that's not that friendly, btw). I have always liked the bar at the W Hotel and I guess have been fortunate to have not interacted much with the hotel staff up until now. I'll be putting friends and business colleagues up at the Four Seasons or Hotel 1000 from now on.

It is in a great location for the airport but it is like you are in nasty place with simple people running the place. They have no computer set up for managing shuttle service. This resulted in extended delays waiting at the airport to be picked up for return to the hotel. The staff was then rude and complained about the cost to send the shuttle driver to get me. I travel over 30 times a year for business and Jet motel used to get my parking business but not anymore. As I waited in the cold for them to come I watched several other parking services make 3 trips through the airport. Use wally, or master park. Jet just doesn't get it.",,,

Our room was huge, in a high floor overlooking quiet and very Parisian Edouard VII place (right between L'Opera and Place Vendome, close to e). Furniture and kitchen applicances were brand new and very stylish, the bathroom was pristine and spacious and the staff were always available and extremely helpful. The residence is quiet and very modern. Breakfast is great (amazing croissants). It doesn't have a hotel feel to it. Quite the contrary.

I've been at Citadines with my husband and three kids ages 13, 11 and 5. We picked up a two bedroom apartment. It was a nice duplex with two bedroms and a sofa bed in the living room,with a functional and well equiped kitchen, one wc and one ""salle de bain"". My teenage boys loved that they could have more privacy than if we were in a hotel, and my little girl loved to have a ""house in Paris"" where we could have breakfast and dinner. I just would like to have more light on the living room, wich was a little bit dark.Some days the cleaning wasn't perfect but then I called the front desk and it was solved. The staff was very nice and helpful. It's very well located, we could go walking to many nice places. I stayed in this 'aparthotel' for 3 nights in August. I needed a centrally located hotel to spend a few days with my 2 sisters, one who lives in Bali and the other in Canada. We had booked a one bedroom apartment, which was clean and tidy, but very small - I slept on the sofa bed which was okay, but you had to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, so there was no privacy at all, and I thought it would be very cramped to have had 4 people (it was pretty cramped with just us 3 anyway). It is in a nice, quiet street and centrally located, with friendly staff. Overall, a bit disappointing and very pricey for what it is. I My wife and I stayed 8 nights with our teenage daughter in a one-bedroom. Nice to have 2 separate rooms. Internet wi-fi worked well (though the codes expired a couple of times during stay and had to be renewed). Business center by restaurant uses same codes and was able to print boarding pass for flight. East connection to airport CDG on Roissy bus just around the corner on Rue Scribe. (Though Roissbus did not stop in an hour--and this before strike actions held--wait at Terminal 2A on arrival, it worked well on the way back--taxi from CDG was about 55 Euros). Monoprix on street in front of hotel (toward La Madeleine), and another supermarket nearby as well. Laundry in basement (9 Euros). Didn't try hotel restaurant. The mini-kitchen was fine as was dishwasher. Difficult We stayed in Citadine Vendome for 2 nights in late May with our 1 year old baby and had a really good stay. We only stayed in hotels before in Paris so this was our first time in an apart hotel, we picked this Citadine due to its location and reviews that it as quiet. The hotel lobby and service was adequate, courteous, the apartment was plainly but comfortably furnished, with a small kitchen area. The good point was the kitchen was separate to the two bedrooms and not in the living room, so when our baby waarate toilet was clean and tastefully furnished, the bedrooms a bit small but actually compared to other places we stayed in Paris before they can be considered spacious. Our room was quiet, there is no traffic in the street but there is a cafe downstairs which we did not find too noisy, windows are well soundproofed. Our baby had 2 very peaceful sleeps thanks to quiet hotel, no banging doors, no traffic and good blackout blinds. For our purposes of separate bedrooms, quiet but central location and an adequate kitchen it was perfect, decor is bland but comfortable so no complaints. We did not use the hotel breakfast, it was 17euros p/p, and since there are so many great cafes out there and the weather was beautiful we chose to eat out.",,,

Avoid this place at all costs. It is really convenient, cheap night rates. Room small but nice designed and clean. 5 minutes walking to Quensway station of subway. wi-fi area free but so slowly. On the same street as the subway station, there are tons of restaurants that open late (indian, malaysian, thai, chinese, pub, fast food). We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel in a studio apartment which meant we had our own cooking facilites. Brilliant for tea and toast or something quick and easy. Eating out is expensive but 2 streets away you can find most cuisines of the world for dining out. The hotel is about 3 mins walk from Hyde Park - great! The studio was great but the bed was very uncomfortable. The electrics were a bit dodgy too and there was street noise at night but -hey-you're in London! Staff were very nice and helpful and the room was cleaned every day. Recommend this hotel for a short stay - location is brill! This hotel is rather clean, with practical but rather cheap furniture. The cleaning is okay, but the reception service is not so good. They are not very communicative. But the worst is the terrible and disturbing sound you hear in the room. whenever someone is taking a shower, washing their hands, flush the toilet you can hear a sound from sewer pipe which tremblates trough out of the room. You can't fall a sleep, in the morning you are wake as soon as someone gets out of bed and uses the bathroom. We had a terrible time and were very happy to leave. The problem is they ask you to pay in advance, so you wouldn't take an other hotel, whoch is really a necessity for your rest. Sorry to be write such a harsh review, if they would fix this problem this would be an okay hotel on a rather good location.",,,

The hotel has a very nice pool and was just a great value for the cost. I would reccommend staying here to everyone We checked in at the last minute - the hotel we had hoped to use was full. The check in guy was great and the hotel itself is fine. Room was a good size and large enough. It was freezing - we turned the a/c off as soon as we walked in and it never got to a comfortable temperature Very little in the way of kitchenware, only one saucepan! That was not a problem for us since we were only staying one night but would be a hassle for anyone planning to stay longer. The room had not been properly cleaned - garbage not emptied, coffee maker still had old coffee in it and the top sheet had been tucked in - looked like there was only one sheet on the bed. We called down for more bedding before realising what had happened! No coffee, no sugar (only sweet and low) ... basically the cleaning stuff had not done their job. Other than that it was fine, comfortable and quiet, close to some shops and restaurants. The Good: - It was near our event. - Easy Freeway Access - Rooms have kitchens and a pullout bed for extra sleeping room. - Muffins, fruit, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are served in the morning. The BAD: -It has a fold out couch bed, but no bedding in the room. I had to go to the front to get it. - I asked for pillows. They didn't have any. Strange to have pull-out beds, but no pillows. - The trash can in the bathroom had not been emptied. - The room is supposed to hold 4 people, but it only had two bath towels. - They have an indoor pool, but the water was ice cold. They could at least try to make it room temperature. - There was a large party going on in a room on the third floor. It disturbed numerous guests. But it seemed to be the front desk girl's friends, so she did nothing about it. In fact, they came down to hang out with her and chatted loudly through the night. All we got in the morning was an apology. Summation: This is a motel to be avoided. My husband and I booked a stay at this hotel on Priceline.com and bid knowing our bid was low and that we could end up anywhere. When the result revealed Homestead we thought perhaps it would be so-so. The hotel was dirty, our daughters knees and feet were black from crawling on the carpet! No A/C in any of the hall, the A/C in our room was stuck at 50 degrees so we froze all night. When we asked for extra pillows in the room we were given bed sheets to cover them with as they were ""out"" of pillow cases. The trash bins all along the outside of the building were over flowing. Room service is only provided weekly so the trash that builds up on a weekly basis in people's room causes an odor to fill the facility. There was no breakfast available the next morning",,,

In the other direction by 2 blocks is KaDeWe, the fabulous 7+ story department store with high quality and designer goods and the most impressive fresh and prepared foods sales and cafe. The liveliest area on that floor was the oyster bar. We decided that if we lived in Berlin, it would be tempting to eat here often for lunch or dinner. Anything gourmet you'd want to buy would be here fresh, or cooked for consuming there or ready to go home. However, at the Brandenburger Hof you'll want to consider being dazzled one evening in the Michelin 1 star Quadriga Restaurant. The multi-course meal was inventive, insanely flavorful, with impeccable service and will be forever memorable. It was a profound cap to our last day in Berlin. We can't wait to see the movie, ""Goodbye Lenin"" again to reminisce and relive our wonderful fun visit to Berlin. We enjoyed four glorious days at this hotel. In the Mitte, The Westin Grand is perfectly located at Friedrichsrasse and Unter den Linden. The buses between Alexanderplatz and the Zoo Station (100 and 200 buses) board at this intersection. Public transportation is easy to do. You buy your tickets on the bus (2.30 is a normal fare within in the city center) So do the tourist buses with commentary, the double decker hop on/hop off buses. We had a junior suite and had two bathrooms - a half bath and a wonderful full bath with two sinks and with fabulous shower.

The liveliest area on that floor was the oyster bar. We decided that if we lived in Berlin, it would be tempting to eat here often for lunch or dinner. Anything gourmet you'd want to buy would be here fresh, or cooked for consuming there or ready to go home. However, at the Brandenburger Hof you'll want to consider being dazzled one evening in the Michelin 1 star Quadriga Restaurant. The multi-course meal was inventive, insanely flavorful, with impeccable service and will be forever memorable. It was a profound cap to our last day in Berlin. We can't wait to see the movie, ""Goodbye Lenin"" again to reminisce and relive our wonderful fun visit to Berlin. This hotel was picked by my company as I attended a fair. The hotel is very nice, elegantly appointed and well located (walking distance from Ku'Dam). Staff is truly great, very polite and friendly. Breakfast is superb. My room was large and quiet (215) with nice bathroom amenities; I suggest the management to upgrade the bedding (mattresses) and to add a safe deposit. Plugs for computer could be over the desk and not under. Only negative point as far as I am concerned; not only Internet is not for free, but one has to pay fees for every device. Great really. Luxury service, brilliant consierge. Great sleep. Loved the restaurant too. Location is right in the middle of the downtown area. We asked for booking 6 tickets for a concert in the evening and everything went smooth. Note this is a small intimate property, so do not expect large facilities. Very nice clean and high standard medium size hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Maybe one of the best gourmet breakfast I have been served in a hotel. Good central locatiom close to the U-bahn and a few min. walk from the Kodam but still in a relatively quiet street, nice restaurants arround. Just got back this morning from 2 nights in Berlin and stayed here on a friend's recommendation. It is modern, comfortable, conveniently located yet on a quiet street, and has a fine restaurant. The staff were universally helpful and friendly. It is a small hotel and plenty luxurious, but with an unpretentious German flair that my wife and I found charming. It is also exquisitely designed, especially the spectacular Die Quadriga restaurant and lovely courtyard garden. Never have we stayed in a 5 star hotel to find the room does not have airconditioning.At night if we had the window open we heard noises all through the night, plus light flooded in.We then pulled the drapes and the room heated up as the window would not stay open!Staff were pleasant and helpful, room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is in a good position but for the money I would recommend another hotel with aircon. It was not hot either while we were there. This hotel is top notch! The breakfast was a marvel, the room was extremely comfortable and fit for purpose. The restaurant was excellent but expensive but hey everything is to Brits these days! Our visit was for about ten days, and the Brandenburger Hof made a perfect base both for exploring Berlin, and for slightly further afield visits to Potsdam and the Bauhaus at Dessau. Only a short walk to the Ku'dam but in a quieter area, we loved the location. Beautifully designed and situated in an urbane residential neighborhood, the hotel interior is a lovely mix of early nineteenth century furniture and artwork with German modernism and contemporary European furniture and art. The vibe is contemporary but the architecture and older portraits and landscapes were beautiful compliments to the twentieth century furniture. A giant neoclassical KPM urn contrasts the Bauhaus designed furniture. in the lobby. The concierge service is a first rate: friendly and they know the city's nooks and crannies. They arranged an English tour of the Dessau Bauhaus, coordinating our train tickets. Boutique art and design bookstores? They know them all. And their restaurant recommendations were wonderful. Rooms are located on the upper floors facing a courtyard, part of which has been enclosed as a winter garden. We had a room with sitting area, generous bath outfitted in limestone and marble, but possibly disappointing to Americans accustomed to the huge bathrooms of corporate hotels. Breakfast is delicious with homemade yogurts, fresh juiced and is served in the enclosed portion of the winter garden which is also a wonderful place for an afternoon coffee, or a drink following dinner. I recommend at least one meal in Die Quadriga, the hotel's intimate restaurant. Wonderful local ingredients, amazing German wines, served amidst lovely furniture and artwork. Staff is welcoming â impeccable but never overly formal or intrusive. I hope to find my way back here one day. I have stayed at the Brandenburger Hof several times over the past few years and I have never tired of the hotel or the welcome, from door man to reception and all restaurant staff. Whilst this is not the cheapest hotel in Berlin, for me it is good value when I look at the comfort levels, attention to detail and the quality food. Rooms are a decent size for a city centre and certainly larger than similar hotels in Berlin, and the winter garden / conservatory breakfast room with rooms opening off is a great place to wake up over the excellent breakfast: snow on the courtyard garden added to its charm. This comfortable and unpretentious hotel is hard to fault . The location is ideal , the street quiet and leafy. The glazed enclosed courtyard gives a spacious and airy feel. The service is soothing and impeccable, the breakfasts stunningly original and so delicious. Lessons in scrambled egg required--no milk!! but the quails eggs on hollandaise with crispy bacon were to die for, ditto the smoked salmon. And those wonderful breads..... after this the mundane attempts of French and Italian hotels to provide this most important of meals will be even more painful to endure. The dinner was elegant and indeed, many locals come to enjoy the talents of this exceptional chef. Peruse the prices carefully on the menu-the White Lady tea was more than we expected and a bit of a surprise! Can't wait for an excuse to go again--a real treat. And yes, this hotel has both. The hotel is nicely located on a residential street, and you wouldn't expect such an elegant hotel to be set here. The hotel is a nice mix of city chic (clean and airy) and old world, and there are special touches that remind you that you are staying in a five-star hotel. I can fully recommend their spa treatments at the Thalelia (in-house), although they are pricy. Although I cannot rate the restaurant, the breakfast is wonderful, with a la carte wishes executed exactly as desired. This is really not a hotel for ""in-out"" stays, and I would recommend it for anyone who is sightseeing in Berlin for a few days. There is nothing to fault about the service, although sometimes you meet up with a young person who is ""in training"" and not fully equipped with the necessary graces to put up with some demanding guests - that means - some of them have ""an attitude"". But this is excusable. In principle, the overall elegance overrides this in every way. I look forward to returning to this hotel and enjoying the friendly, yet practiced discretion of the staff. I have been traveling for the past three months to different cities in Europe. The Brandenburger Hof was by far the worst experience I had throughout my trip. The admistration was unforgiving for removing a day from our contract, because our group had to leave a day earlier to our next city. They charged our credit card for all incidentals, after being told several times to collect each individuals credit card for their own incidentals. Please tell me how a Holiday Inn or Best Western can understand this concept.. But a supposedly high end hotel couldn't compute it? Overall my whole experience of just constantly dealing with no sympathy or proper office accomidations, made my stay disgusting and made me nausea. WARNING!!! DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU EVER GO TO BERLIN!!! Besides... it is extremely far away from the center of action in Berlin... Which is all in East Berlin. The 15 mn cab rides got old around week two. (and expensive).",,,
Giulia_London,877818,"I stayed in this hotel for more than a week in December for a business trip. The hotel is generally clean. The stuff polite but not too helpful. The room was good size, but not enough storage space and I don't expect too much of it anyway; quiet one, facing internal courtyard, which on the downside meant not too much light. Room service was also decent, but nothing special. All in all an average hotel. I stayed in this hotel for two nights because it was close to the office. Knowing that it's on the Asian side I braced myself for a bad experience and instead had a very nice stay. The room was extremely spacious for the price paid. The only drawback was the view, or better lack of it, from the window (one of my colleagues got a room with no window - now that would have changed the experience completely). The staff was OK. Breakfast wasn't of the best ones, but I managed to find something eatable. All in all it was quite a pleasant stay.","I arrived late due to the usual awful Istanbul traffic. Nearly two hours from the AIrport, but I was told that it was normally an hour. Free upgrade to a suite on the fifth floor which was fantastic, with a walk around balcony, Jacuzzi and loads of floor space. A Smoking room, but didn't smell of cigarettes so no problem. The Bar and restaurant was completely empty (on a Thursday) and completely devoid of atmosphere, but the meal I had was well presented, cooked beautifully and very reasonable. It's just a shame the drinks waitress managed to forget my drink even though I was the only customer in the Bar or restaurant. I'd have liked to go out to eat I think, but the weather was terrible, and so was the location (or at least felt like it). There's a minaret near (it's Istanbul after all), so unless you have earplugs or are a heavy sleeper, expect to be woken up by it at 6am. Nice hotel, friendly and kind personnel, good and clean rooms, very good breakfast. Good for business travelers provided that you are close to your meetings. The area around however is really poor. Not a place for tourists. My company booked this hotel because it is close the our office in Istanbul. I was on a business trip but accompanied by my wife and our 3 month old boy. We enjoyed the hotel, but my wife got bored because there is nothing around the hotel. The rooms are very nice and spacious and modern. The service was good. The crib we booked was already in the room and everyone was very nice to the baby. There was a good buffet for breakfast. WiFi was included. The other amneties we couldn't really find or try out (where the heck is the pool you see on the homepage?) So nothing to complain about, but the only thing there is nothing to do around the hotel. You need a car to get anywhere, and all the places are really far away. The only thing close by is the Ikea with an attached shopping area. If you want to go to a nice restaurant you already need to drive more than 20 minutes. My wife wanted to go for a walk during the day, but this is impossible with a stroller. No pedestrians ways, a lot of traffic all around and as western you are pretty exposed in this area. So, good for business trips, but don't think about going to this hotel as tourist. I stayed in this hotel for two nights because it was close to the office. Knowing that it's on the Asian side I braced myself for a bad experience and instead had a very nice stay.

cochleartraveller,2223865,"I stayed only one night here this time as I was looking around for hotels near this area that was convenient and of a decent acceptable level and priced at an acceptable budget. I accidentally came across Park Regis Hotel and at the published rate on the web promotion it was a very tempting experience to try out. I therefore booked a room. I was most impressed and truly enjoyed my stay here. I was however not able to verify the facilities as at that time. It was a sudden stop over need. One of the best points is that the there is parking. This Hotel is located in a pretty good location, but for what I got, I think it is costly. The hotel management claimed that there was parking available. It is public parking, not hotel reserved parking and that means there is additional cost. The room is very small and feels like a budget hotel. Unless there is little choices left, I would try another hotel around the area. The best part of this hotel is Bugis Junction is very very near. The City Hall MRT is just a short walk away. which makes this hotel one of the most centrally located to most corners of Singapore by MRT or bus. However for night life, a short cab ride will be needed to prevent one from breaking into sweat! Generally a good hotel, but do not hope for any thing too much for views.","A little bit expensive considering the room size. Like the CD player next to bed. 3 minute walk to Bugis Junction. Have to walk to other building for breakfast. The rooms might be too small for travelers with large luggage, but those staying in Singapore just for a few days will find that this hotel is so convenient thanks to its proximity to the Bugis Junction train station. Actually, you can even walk to Suntec Convention Center and the Esplanade if you're in no hurry. The hotel is fairly new, so it's very clean. We only had two carry-on luggage with us, so the size of the room wasn't an issue. We were in Singapore to go out and see the sights and not to hang out in the room, anyway. The furniture was decent, the design minimalist. WiFi connection is decent as well. It's true, though, that according to some reviewers, the walls seem to be too thin. You can hear vacuuming in the morning. And, get this, one night when my husband and I got back at the hotel, we actually heard a couple in one of the rooms having ""an awesome time""---if you get what I mean. Might not want to run the risk of hearing something awkward when you're in this hotel with kids. But overall, we would stay at this hotel again because of the great location and cleanliness. And by the way, we were accommodated for check-in (by a friendly lobby staff at that) even if our flight got in at past 1AM already. Just don't forget to shoot an email to the hotel beforehand to inform them if you're checking in late. This Hotel is located in a pretty good location, but for what I got, I think it is costly. The hotel management claimed that there was parking available. It is public parking, not hotel reserved parking and that means there is additional cost. The room is very small and feels like a budget hotel. Unless there is little choices left, I would try another hotel around the area. The best part of this hotel is Bugis Junction is very very near. Stayed for 3 nights, rooms very clean, hotel fairly new. We booked a de-luxe room with a window, this room (716) was very noisy as it had the hotels air vent in the room and even noisier when the AC was on, asked to be moved next day which we were without any problems given room 702. Bed was uncomfortable as it had a PVC covering and the sheet kept sliding off. The room was very small, it would be ok for a single person but a bit of a tight squeeze for 2 people, bathroom clean and compact. Breakfast was a few minutes walk from the hotel and it was basic, only went there the first day. Hotel in a good area near the MRT, Raffles etc. Although it was clean and the staff were helpful we would not stay there again, mainly because of the size of the room. This is a new hotel, so obviously everythingâs clean and brand spanking new. Itâs so new that the taxi driver hasnât heard of it, and neither did his friends (he called everyone he knew). After dropping me off at Suntec City, a familiar landmark near Beach Road, I walked about 5 minutes before reaching the entrance of the hotel. Check-in was quick and efficient and my request for a room with proper ventilation was fulfilled. The room was small, but enough for a quick lone business trip to this City where room rates can be quite exorbitant. The beds were comfortable and thereâs an LCD attached to the side wall (clever way to save space). Thereâs even a DVD player, so you can bring along your favourite movie to watch. Breakfast is not buffet style, but instead catered at a nearby Chinese coffee house, about 3 minutes walk. You have a few breakfast set to choose from e.g. a choice between toast bread, French Toast or Fried Vermicelli with Coffee or Tea. Nothing to shout about, in fact I recommend to skip it. You can get better breakfast across the street at Bugis Junction. 3 LRT stations are within walking distance (Bugis, Esplanade and City Hall). In summary, this is the place to be if you need a cheap and clean place to sleep when youâre in town. The rooms at this hotel are TINY. There is room for a bed and not much else, and the wardrobe is a few inches deep with space for just two hangers. However, it is very clean, and the bathroom was good, and the staff were friendly. Breakfast was served at a nearby restaurant but we left too early for it, but the location is great. Just five minutes walk from the restaurants in the Arab quarter, and two minutes from the Bugit MRT and Bugit mall with a fantastic food court. You do have to pay for wifi though... tiny room, limited space, you can't have enough even to store your luggage. bright side is: helpful staff, a VERY good location, affordable and they provide breakfast in the nearby restaurant. you will not be finding difficulties to eateries. turn your head around, the famous shabu-shabu restaurants, korean bbq, local cuisines. shopping? few paces away from Bugis junction. would definitely stay again. I like the big mirror on the walls and location. Stayed in this hotel end October 2011. I paid extra for a room with a window and although the room was small but it had everything you needed. I only stayed one night on a stopover so it was ok but I think it was a bit pricey compared to other places I have stayed in Singapore. Close to Bugis Junction and Suntec shopping centres and Bugis station, ok...lets face it... the rooms are tiny... but this is the ideal place for people who are lookin to having fun in singapore... going to places and seeing the attractions... rather than a luxury hotel room..... we wanted a room that was comfortable enough just to sleep in and freshen up in... and this place offers just that! very clean rooms...room service is great.... and the location is jus a 5 mins walk from the bugis mrt.... and bugis junction is so centrally located from every place u need to go in singapore.... so if u wanna spend on having fun and minimum on stay with the facilities of a three star this is definitely ur place.... rooms also have a kettle... coffee sachets... a hair dryer... and two tiny bottles of drinking water :) If you are looking for a budget hotel with clean room to sleep and conveniently located within a short walking distance to shopping area, mass rail transit, and eateries - this one's for you. Don't expect much from the room - its a budget hotel for starters. It's small with little luggage space but it's clean and air conditioning is great. Reception staff is polite and efficient. Within a 5-10 mins casual walk, there are lots of great restaurants, Parco shopping complex with 2 great food courts and restaurants, Luma shopping complex, the famous Bugis Junction, MRT station. A little further walk, there's City Hall shopping complex and MRT, Singapore-Malaysia taxi station, Funan IT mall, National Library, and F1 circuit. Great hotel if you're looking for much. Stayed in Marrison Hotel for 3 nights, price was good compare to many others. It is a fairly new hotel, so everything looked pretty good. Room is clean, bed is comfy. But it is super small!! After we put our luggage on the floor, we barely have space to walk around. It is ok for a few nights' rest. The room is very small but cleaned everyday ,the staff is helpful , good location is close to Bugis MRT aprox 5 minutes ,Suntec City is aprox 10 mins , free wifi which is good for those coming for business ,I Booked Deluxe Room no breakfast includes but many restaurant around so pretty easy to get food options. 2 bottles water daily,cleaned towels everyday,and soap and toothpaste ,if you coming for just to sleep at night and on budget will be good for you My rom no.407 (no window) The room is small but it's clean and neat, my room was cleaned every day. The location is near to bugis mrt and bus shelter, so the location is really strategic. No restaurant/breakfast is available at the hotel, but you can find a lot of food stall nearby and also easy to find halal-food. Stayed here in excess of 2 weeks. It's conveniently located, clean and perfectly adequate for what it is, i.e. a no frills type accommodation in the heart of the city. There were some problems with getting the room we booked but I'd write that off to operational kinks - after all, it is a new hotel. Stayed here 4 nights for business travel . During check in, the staff was not talking too much, in fact , not talk at all . Only requested my passport and gave me they key. I asked him ,""Thats it? "" , ""that's it "" . He said. At least with a smile . Anyway, i went up to see my room, which located on highest floor. It's small but still good enough for 1 or 2 person. There's a small wardrobe to hang 3-4 clothes, electric kettle , 2 bottles of water which they refill everyday , 2 sachet of instant coffees , mug , and hair dryer, , aircon and LCD tv. I found hair on my pillow . But the rest is clean, though. It's just the room is without window , which they have stated at the Agoda, and there's noise coming from ventilation hole in the bathroom. It can be annoying if you are not get used to it. I can sleep the whole night no problem. I called receptionist to ask for wifi password , which is free and fast enough. I like the location . If you come out from the lobby and simply turn left and straight , you will get to the Bugis junction and MRT. Below hotel, there's Seven eleven , and lots of restaurant. Taxi is easy to get , provided that not during peak hours. Only 15 min to the airport . Anyway, for business trip, or if you just need clean simple room with wifi and affordable price in great location, this will suits you.",,,
sameer452,676106,"We stayed there with our children and they just loved their room. the staff was excellent and very friendly. Their breakfast is great and a greta hotel either for self or when travelling with the family it is just 500ms from the metro Policlinico and is in a nice quite neighbourhood with a great bar/snack place just across. Nice hotel with clean rooms ,which are of decent size. There is a nice buffet breakfast with one of the best coffee's I have had. Location is great you are bang in the middle of dubai not far from the new part that is the marina,autodrome etc and of course not far from Bur Dubai and Old Dubai. To top it ,it is barely 150-200mts from the Metro staion and Mall of the Emirates is barely 500 mts away. The area around the hotel also nice little dai;y need shops. There is a small pool on the roof , nothing much but cools you,gym is not big but decent enough for a quick workout. The staff is helpful and checkin was quick. would not mind staying there again.","Nice hotel with clean rooms ,which are of decent size.

Nice hotel for staying while on business. Clean rooms, nothing fancy, very quiet. The real advantage is the location. 200 meters to the Sharaf DG Metro station. The small restaurants at street level are from OK to great. Turkish, Egyptian, Lebanese, Indian and more restaurants are within a 10 min walk. You can have a feast for AED 20 to 30. 15 minute walk to Mall of the Emirates, but take the Metro in the summer months. we usually stay at one of the higher market chain hotels in dubai but decided to try to budget this time as we were also travelling to another part of the middle east. however we did find that the Â£300 we paid for three nights (inc of 20% taxes ,exc breakfast etc) rather too high for the quality of the hotel.it is an old hotel with smallish rooms and a small pool (not enough sun loungers while we were there). although this didnt matter to us too much as we were only on a short visit to see family in dubai, i could see it posing a problem to those guests who were on holidays ( the hotel also seems to cater to package holiday operators). the hotel is kept clean though i will point out that the bed throw was due for a clean! (it was stained). the duvet cover, sheets and pillow cases etc and bathroom were very clean. the carpet seems old and i did find the room a bit smelly ( cigarettes?) when i first entered the room. however this soon disappeared once we were settled in and had air con on. the staff were very pleasant, polite and helpful. the hotel is in a good location for the metro and the mall and also there are supermarkets and plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.i probably wouldnt stay here again (well not at Â£100 per night without breakfast) but would recommend if the hotel was offered or found at a discounted price. I've just returned from Dubai having stayed at the Golden Tulip for 3 nights. Overall, it was an ok experience but I wouldn't return. Firstly, the room I was allocated smelt so bad of stale cigarette smoke. I asked if I could be moved and one of the porters came back to the room, sprayed some air freshener around the room and then left. This didn't help so I just lived with it and kept my clothes in my bags at all times. The water came out of the shower brown at first which was quite worrying. It sounded like there was an air-conditioning unit right outside my window (on the 6th floor) which was really loud, all night. I reckon this would keep some people up. There is a very loud nightclub on the ground floor, just behind reception so I recommend you request a room as high up as possible. There is also a bar on the first floor but it's not as noisy, shows football and you can use the wifi in there for free (just ask the bar-staff). There was a lot of choice for breakfast although I wouldn't recommend the cooked buffet. As I experienced in another hotel at the start of the week, the alternatives for pork are (understandably) veal bacon and chicken or beef sausages. I found the bread and fruit are a better option. Although I have slated this hotel, the staff were all super friendly and the pool was a nice place to relax in. It's too small to swim lengths in but great to cool down in. The hotel is very conveniently next to a metro stop (Sharaf DG) and just one stop away from Mall of the Emirates, although I wouldn't bother using the train as you can walk there in about 10 minutes (unless it's scorching hot). If you can get this hotel for cheap then go for it. If it's for a week or so, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. It's definitely not a 4 star hotel. Good location as itâs nearby Mall of the Emirates. This is my second time to staying here, but honestly NOT a good care taken of rooms like before. All corridors were smelly; the moisture level was high inside the hotel. The room was too smelly & damp as well. You can almost feel the moisture on the bed as well, adding to that the strong bad smell.. The newspaper, magazines were damp as well. Itâs not taken care of like before. Did not like it & disappointed :( I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights on bed and breakfast and was alone. The service was good and so was the breakfast. The room was ideal, not too large, not too small and the bed was comfy. It has a rooftop pool which is small, but nice, and their is a nightclub downstairs which was okay. All in all my stay at this hotel was pleasurable considering the amount i paid for it! It is located 300m from the Mall of the Emirates, and about 200m from the metro. It was initially a bit difficult to find considering there are no signs directing you to the hotel when you walk out of the metro. It is located on the right of Cassel's hotel (at the back). There is a telepizza in the same building which proved convenient when feeling peckish. Staff were prompt to assist with any problems or queries. I spent 10 Months in the Hotel. Good quality 4 star property with a great central location. Staff are well trained and eager to please. Clean and efficiently run. I was very comfortable and hope to continue to return. The service was really great, staff were very freindly and helpfull,my room was in a very good condition, clean, comfortable, amenities were available, clean towels and bath robe as well. Although the location of the hotel is not on the main road and difficult to find first time you look for it but after you check in surly you donât want to move to another hotel. I like the bar of the hotel (Locker room) it is a place where you can relax in a friendly atmosphere and have a quick bite as well. Food was great and tasty, prices were reasonable and worth the money you are spending. The superior Room was well appointed and of a good size. Cleanliness of very high standard and staff service pleasant and professional. Rooftop great for relaxing (although at the moment there are a couple of building projects in the near vicinity with some noise and dust.....but hey....there's plenty of sand in Dubai!) I never heard any building noise inside my room. Added bonus is the health/gym center with plenty of nice new machines and a sauna. The hotel is a very short walk to the metro and a bit further to the Mall of Emirates for those who like shopping. There are also plenty of good and very well priced little restaurants in Al Barsha area and plenty of ""super markets"". If staying for longer time breakfast can become a bit ""boring"" but quality of the food provided is mostly fresh and ok. Great 4 star hotel within walking distance of the Mall of the Emirates and close to Ski Dubai the fantastic theme park. We stayed in their new Flamingo Residence with the kitchenettes which was very useful for preparing a light meal. The staff are so friendly and efficient and a big thank you to Lucky who took such great care of us in the restaurant. Lucky's wonderful food recommendations were delicious. Overall we had a great experience and will definately recommend the The Golden Tulip Al Barsha to our friends The reception lady was not friendly at all. they nevertheless gave me the room very early 8 AM which I appreciated what I did not appreciate was that they insisted on having my credit card which I couldn't find at that moment I had to give them cash When I found my card and asked my cash back they said it was already registered with a very bad exchange rate that pissed me off. It's not walking minutes from emirates mall there's another golden tulip much nearer cabs don't know it Won't come back This hotel IS in a bit of a building site of an area, however it is also pretty central for seeing the sights of Dubai and if you can make do with some sand and gravel and taxis everywhere from it, then it's not all bad. The actual hotel itself has decent facilties on the smaller scale for Dubai, the rooftoop pool did that job, breakfast was ok and the rooms were fine. Nothing amazing but it is billed as a business hotel rather than leisure, although saying that, the computers in the internet lounge never seemed to work which was rather frustrating. Staff were exceptional so overall this helps the hotel rating. We were there for 3nights for business so not too bad for this.",,,
chinagirl033,582461,"This is the best apartment/hotel we've stayed at in this area.We booked a one bedroom studio and it was excellent.The lounge was big and light with a balcony, there was a dining area and a big square separate kitchen with all the usual things you'd find in a self catering apartment microwave, hob, washing machine fridge etc.The en-suite bedroom was large also with a small balcony and there were no other buildings overlooking us. The staff were very friendly and the apartment was cleaned everyday with clean bed linen and towels. There was also a second toilet and washroom. There was plenty of parking space in the basement car park and we also used the metro which is very clean and reliable and the station is only a 5 min walk away. There's a great pizza place next door and they will deliver to your room. It's about a 10 min walk to the Mall of the Emirates. We'll definately stay there again. We stayed here over the Christmas and New Year and it is in a great location. 5 Mins walk to the Mall of the Emirates, 5 mins to the nearest Metro station, which runs every 4 mins both ways. There is a great shop across the road called the ""Pinecone"" it is run by a really friendly couple selling fresh fruit & veg, bread and cheeses etc ideal for anyone staying in a self catering apartment. There is a subway sandwich shop across the road and at the corner of the street there is a Holiday Inn which has a sports bar etc and a few restaurants. The apartments are fully equiped, cooker, microwave, washing machine etc and very clean. Our only downside is if you get an apartment on the side of the hotel the rooms are very dark because there are building on either side of it. If you want to go up the Khalifa tower make sure you book a few days in advance.","We are in the middle of a 9-night family trip and felt compelled to post our opinions on this site. The apartment is well sized, big living room, nice kitchen, and bedroom. For the most part, the staff is nice, but some don't seem to make the effort to accommodate your needs. The place is very clean and well kept. However... We are paying a moderate price for 2 adults and 1 child and yet the child has to sleep on the uncomfortable coach cushions, otherwise we would be charged AED 675.00 (~ USD 200) for an extra mattress. Nickel-n-diming is not something you'll usually see on a 5 star. I'm also disappointed that the dvd player barely functions, the image is missing the 'blue' color and the remote is precarious. If you're staying on a single bedroom unit, don't expect a good view, as all of these units face buildings in very close proximity. The pool is nice and the gym is basic. Therefore this is an average hotel, but far from a five star. These apartments were recommended to us by a friend who travels to Dubai frequently and we weren't disappointed! We had a 1 bedroom apartment but it was huge! we had a queensize bed, 2 bathrooms (one with 2 x showers and sinks!) and a large kitchen area. The staff were friendly and very accomodating and the Pool was lovely! great views over the Burj al Arab and I was always the only one up there! The apartments are located right next to the Mall of the Emirates and the Metro so perfect for exploring! We will definately visit again. i stayed with my partner for 8 nights to an excecutive suite 75sq meters. the appartment was superb!! very vey comfortable, big bedroom with big clothes storage area, working desk, flat screen tv, and nice decorative as you can see on the photo.Very big bed !!! One wc, and a bathroom , with bathtub and shower!! Big kitchen area, fully epuipment and big living room area with dining area and big screen flat tv. totaly was better than we imagine before. Vey clean, helpfull reception staff, we easily found a taxi. It's 5 min walking to the metro station, and 5 min to Mall of Emirates ( big shopping mall, with big Carefour super market). Because on the area there are more hotels-appatments, there are some restaurants and mini markets around where you can buy anything you need. Even there was a restaurant on the hotel 24 hours open for breakfast and dining , we didn't use it. There was a small swimming pool on the roof top, but it was ok to spend some hours there.The only complain i had, was the difficulty to find some one from the spa personel to give us towel for the sunbeds.So, i went down to our room and i tokk the bathroom towels for the pool. Free internet acces on our room. No noise from outside. My cousin when she came to our appartment was been jealous instead of her 4star hotel room next to Burj Khalifa. How foolish i am when on my past trips to Dubai i didn't know it and i stayed to a 4star more expensive hotel !!!! Of course i would prefer to stay again to Coral boutique Al Barsha !!! Booked into this ""Below Standard"" Hotel with my husbands work. Had I been the one paying we would have left after check in! The rooms are like something from the 60's or 70's with drab decor and yellow & orange sofa's. Dirty marks on the walls, handprints on the walls, Patio doors filthy! The dust on the skirting boards was thick. The balcony was unusable due to the build up of dirt! Never cleaned for the 3 weeks we were there. The Housekeeping! Well, they dont clean under tables, dont dust tables or skirting boards, dont leave toilet paper and if you ask for some you are given 1 roll - we had 3 bathrooms!! Did not replenish toiletries, No towel or soap in guest bathroom (hello!! Hygene!! The kitchen tap swivels loose,no chain on plug so 5 broken nails from prising it out! Kitchen equipment for 4 people consisted of 1 fork, 3 knives, 3 mugs, 3 glasses!! The Ironing board sits at a slant and falls over if not careful, the washing machine is in italian, no english instructions. Very little in the way of utensils, not even a big spoon!. The pool is nice but the loungers are dirty and same dirty marks been there 2 weeks. The staff all seem pleasant enough but not had much contact with them. Unfortunately some revarnishing of old furniture was going on during my stay so my car was boxed in with furniture in the basement and the room was toxic with the varnish fumes for about the first week. Breakfast is very limited and if you want a Latte then it costs extra! Would I recommend this? No way! Far nicer hotel apartments in Al Barsha area. Would not come back! We stayed in an executive one bedroom suite (appt 204), one of the largest rooms in dubai for the price. No balcony and no view from the room, as further building is ongoing on the next plot, this is Dubai remember, but i did not come here to stay in my hotel room and admire the view. Large lounge/dining area, well equipped kitchen, good size bed and a small bathroom with bath and separate shower. Free in room internet was a pleasant surprise. Large flat screen tv (plus dvd player) in lounge with good sat package. A decently equipped gym, spa and a roof top pool are standard for hotel apartments. Service was good, despite poor reviews elsewhere. Taxis were always available outside, but only 300metres to the Mall of the Emirates metro station. A range of restaurants and a few supermarkets exist close by for essentials. Contrary to other reviews I found the A/C adjustable and adequate to deal with for 35 centigrade temperates. try to get the room only option, breakfast seems overpriced. I have stayed in many hotel apartments in Dubai and this would represent the best value in this field. There is no arrangement to access another hotel's beach but hotel is close to numerous beach front hotels which offer day passes. We used le Meridien hotel beach about five to ten minutes away by taxi and found this beach to be quite adequate. Maybe not at 5 star hotel/apartment, but a fine 4 star. All the staff provided 5 star service especially Ahmed Ali & Andrew Dahanayke. Large apartment. Good location. 300 meters from Metrostation: Sharaf DG. 500 meters from Emirates Mall. (Use the entrance at Kempinski Hotel) 100 meters from small supermarket and few restaurants. We stayed here over the Christmas and New Year and it is in a great location. 5 Mins walk to the Mall of the Emirates, 5 mins to the nearest Metro station, which runs every 4 mins both ways. There is a great shop across the road called the ""Pinecone"" it is run by a really friendly couple selling fresh fruit & veg, bread and cheeses etc ideal for anyone staying in a self catering apartment. There is a subway sandwich shop across the road and at the corner of the street there is a Holiday Inn which has a sports bar etc and a few restaurants. The apartments are fully equiped, cooker, microwave, washing machine etc and very clean. Our only downside is if you get an apartment on the side of the hotel the rooms are very dark because there are building on either side of it. If you want to go up the Khalifa tower make sure you book a few days in advance. We decided to stay for a few days over the Eid break and booked a room from a booking website which states the room accommodates 4people, which we thought would be fine for our family of 2 adults and 11and 12 year old. When we arrived, the room had 1 king bed, a lingering stench of cigarette smoke, and dirty, grubby old furniture. We argued with the duty manager for no less than 1 1/12 hours about the bed issue only. Despite repeated admissions that the website was misleading and that the information upon which we booked the room was wrong (which was provided by the hotel),and that that they had additional beds, they refused to provide any extra beds without additional cost. We were absolutely gobsmacked at the attitude of the duty and front manager which was that they would rather risk formal complaints to the upper management and legal action, rather than to provide a portable bed for our children free of charge (despite agreeing that it was reasonable for us to assume that the room should have 4beds). We are frequent international travelers and have never been so astonished at such a disregard for providing customer service or meeting a hotel's obligation. Aside from this issue, the room, as stated was small, very smelly with the stale cigarette smoke, and worn...meanwhile, my children slept on the floor. Avoid this hotel at all costs!",,,
Danyellow,239408,"We arrived early and were very tired from our long plane ride into Spain. Thankfully, the man at this hostal didn't hesitate to check us in and allow us in our reserved room hours before check-in time. My only complaint is the strong smell of lemon-scented wood polish. I'm pretty sensitive to that kind of thing though. Everything else was very lovely, and the price and location was ideal. From our window we were able to watch a Semana Santa procession, and see the touristy Plaza del Sol. The Sol metro station was very close and convenient. The people who worked at this hostal were very pleasant and friendly. Some quirks: There is an annoying band that often plays loudly in Plaza del Sol, you must check in your hotel key every time you leave your room, and our shower was held together with duct tape (but worked fine).","Plusses: situated right in the center, within walking distance to many sights (Prado, Opera, Plazas), room spotless, good beds, friendly and familiar atmosphere. Breakfast ok for 3 euros. Great chance to practise your Spanish since hostal personnel hardly able to speak decent English. Minusses: loud environment, so impossible to sleep with window open; strong smell of chlorex in the room. Considerable fly in the ointment: new Camper shoes, bought on the Calle Arenal on Monday, Oct 31 for 160 euros and kept in a shop paper bag by the bed, disappeared from the room! Nobody knows ""whodunnit"", so when adding this loss to the room price, the room price stopped being a bargain - although the shocked receptionist offered not to charge for breakfast. Too bad. We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our trip and were quite pleased with it. And it's great value for the money. I found the people on the front desk very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and spacious - our bathroom was quite small, but adequate. Everyone seemed to be aware that they needed to be considerate of others and we found no noise from the other guests at all. They offer a breakfast for a moderate price, but we didn't opt for it - we chose to go out and forage for our breakfast. But they very kindly kept some milk that we had bought in their fridge, since one of our group is celiac and brought his own breakfast cereal. Can't beat the location - 15 steps from the Plaza del Sol! We stayed at the Hotel Riesco for a long weekend getaway. It was perfect! In the center of town, right next to the Puerta del Sol, conveniently close to all of the downtown sights, restaurants, bars and the metro. We booked our room for 55Euros a night, and were so happy with our choice! The hotel is in an interesting old building and has many charming rooms, some facing the plaza with juliet balconies. Our room was upstairs in the back, so a little quieter. There were all hardwood floors throughout, and it was freshly painted and immaculately clean. The bed in the room was a small double bed, a little tight for two, but was comfortable. Some rooms had larger beds. The bathroom is also tiny, but clean and functional. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is that you have to ring to be let into the building. This makes it very safe, but we felt quite bad ringing to be let in after a night out at a club. However, we were very promptly let in by the night desk worker (but clearly we woke her up. sorry!) The hotel offers breakfast, which you order the night before. It was good for the price. There are coffee shops and restaurants nearby that have wider selections. The hotel also offers Wi-Fi in the lobby, and had a lending library. Hostal Riesco is similar to a nice pensione in Italy. Located on two floors of an old building on the Puerta del Sol square it is perfectly located in the center of Old Madrid. It is right across the street from one of the hub metro stations. From this metro, you can get everywhere quickly. Of course, you are a short walk from the Prado, Cava Baja nightlife, the Huertas nightlife, Plaza Mayor and other destinations. There are many little shops right outside the front door including a very nice bakery. The bedroom and the bathroom were very spacious. The decor and furniture are very simple, but functional. The place was clean as a whistle. This was a tremendous value at 56 euros for a double room. The staff was very helpful if you had questions. A few items of note, the TV has no english channels and the upper floor does not have wireless access. You have to go downstairs to the sitting area or breakfast area to use the wireless internet. The connection was fine when sitting downstairs. It is not too noisy, but if you are very sensitive to noise ask for an inside room. Heard about this place from a friend. Was delighted when we got there, prime location, excellent value for money, spotless, comfortable with a great view. Wasn't expecting much because of the cheap price so was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Amazing view in the heart of peurto de la sol. 2 second walk to the metro, which is so easy to use. Was staying with a friend and we each had a lovely comfortable double bed. Place had character and was very clean. Its not the four seasons but it definitly did the job and surpassed my expectations. When we checked in, they told us the room had air conditioning, but then they hardly turned it on. And Madrid was really hot in the afternoon! We tried to get them to turn it on at night at least, but they refused. ""It's impossible,"" the man said. So with the windows open, it was extremely noisy and we didn't get a good night's rest. What a shame, as it has the perfect location. But there are hundreds of hostals in the area - so I recommend that everyone give Hostal Rieso a pass. simply perfect basic place, sympa people and super location. Just go! From our window we were able to watch a Semana Santa procession, and see the touristy Plaza del Sol. The Sol metro station was very close and convenient. The people who worked at this hostal were very pleasant and friendly. Some quirks: There is an annoying band that often plays loudly in Plaza del Sol, you must check in your hotel key every time you leave your room, and our shower was held together with duct tape (but worked fine). My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights earlier this March. We were very active in the city and for 55 Euros/night this place was great. Right on Puerta del Sol it is very convenient to the metro. We never had a problem with the noise. It was easy to find and there are a ton of good bars/restaurants nearby. It is within walking distance of many of Madrid's main attractions. Overall we enjoyed Hostal Riesco. Our room was very simple and the bathroom was small. There was no hairdryer (in case you need one) and the water pressure seemed fine. If you are active in the city and are just looking for a place to come back to, sleep, and keep your things this is a solid option. We spent 6 nights at Hostal Riesco and have two young children. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the room was of adequate size. I would have preferred a real bathroom door vs. an accordian door. The heat worked well and there was hot water and good shower pressure. There was also wifi available in the breakfast area, but not in our room. Breakfast was coffee, juice, toast and a croissant. The location on Plaza del Sol cannot be beat. We had terrible weather the week we were in Madrid, but it didn't matter as we could dash to the metro quickly. There are many good restaurants in the surrounding area. We would definitely stay here again and the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. When we had a problem with our room they were very accomodating in changing us to another room. I would list the ONLY downfall was smoking. The folks at the front desk smoked, as well as guests, and even the bath towels had a faint smell of smoke.",,,
Roy C,608417,"We loved this hotel!! We spent four days in Rome after a long business trip. What a wonderful place to relax before returning home. We chose this hotel from reviews on tripadvisor. The reviews are right on target. We were more than pleased with this choice. Our room was lovely and most comfortable. We thought the room was large for European standards. The breakfasts were delicious, with many choices. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. The location was perfect, within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. The Metro was right around the corner, no need for taxis or the hop on hop off bus. We have already recommended this hotel to friends and will absolutely stay here again on our next trip to Rome. Having stayed at many BW hotels this was a nice, refreshing surprise. The booking (on the road) and the check in upon arrival was excellent and the service outstanding. Having a large 3/4 ton van can have its challenges for parking, however the reception staff were very helpful in accomodating this requirement, even before I got there. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and decor. The location is great if you want to explore downtown Seattle and its historic section. Pikes market is a nice walk away and the 'free' tourist bus route is close at hand. The rail transit to/from Seatac is not too far away and is an economical way to travel this leg, if required. Our seven-day (Dec. 11-18) Mayan Riviera trip was unforgettable -- the Cenotes, Ek'Balam ruins, Playa del Carmen's 5th Avenue, Rio Secreto, zip-lining, rappelling, etc. But above all that, the feeling of being treated like royalty at the Blue Bay was priceless! No regrets selecting this resort at all. The staff loved their jobs and that was evident in their positive demeanor; always smiling, courteous and very hard-working. Hence, clean room, sheets, towels and especially the grounds, immaculate! The on-site Nolitours rep, Bianca, is Canadian and she speaks fluent Spanish, was a great help. The food was good and the presentation first-class. The front desk staff (especially Jorge) was very helpful. The hotel tour shuttles were always on time. We had an amazing time there!

The room was very quiet and comfortable and the entire staff was friendly and helpful. They were also happy to speak English, which certainly helped us as our German skills are shaky at best. The ideal location is just a few steps away from the fabulous KurfÃ¼rstendamm and also a U-bahn stop. For the price, I doubt that there is a better hotel along the Kuâdamm. We would gladly stay here again.","Me and a friend stayed here for a night. Great stay! Very reasonable price. The room was big and comfy. Amazing shower! So much character. The breakfast (included) was amazing with a variety of juices, homemade yogurt, breads, meats, etc. A great atmosphere overall. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They kept our bags after check-out to let us explore Berlin. The location was great!! Hotel is within walking distance to Zoo Garten train station and major shopping. I highly recommend this hotel. We booked a room with our own private toilet and shower. They have other cheaper options. When in Berlin, I will always stay at this hotel. What a great find!

We would gladly stay here again. Great location, wonderful hosts, safe & quirky. We have stayed here many times over the past decade. I'm sad to see this business suffer due to the development of the new central station HBH. Make the effort to go back to ZOO station & 5 min. walk-you will be pleased. My wife and I visited Berlin for the first time in December to enjoy the city's Christmas markets. We booked the Hotel Pension Columbus, conveniently situated in the centre of the city. What a find!. Warm, clean, fascinating building ( the rooms had ceiling heights of 4.2 metres!),built in the early 1900's and retaining many original features. We enjoyed the warm hospitality of the owners who gave us lots of good advice on where and what to visit. Breakfast was excellent and our room spotless. This hotel is a real gem and I would recommend it wholeheartedly. We (couple with two adult sons 21&18) were on an extended winter holiday through Europe and we stayed three nights and loved this place. It is really well located with plenty of restaurant, shopping and transport options close by. Chris is an amazingly friendly host and her breakfasts were fantastic - all that you could want to eat. I've reviewed this hotel before, having been quite happy with it when I was travelling alone. This time around, I was travelling with my fiancÃ©e. My first interaction with the hotel was the morning before our arrival, when I called to advise that we may be cancelling at the last minute, due to my fiancÃ©e possibly not being able to fly. The woman on the other end (one of the owners, I believe) was very sympathetic and told me not to worry -- if I had to cancel at the last minute due to illness, we would not be charged for our room. Win! On our arrival, we were quite disappointed by the fact that our room, which on the booking website was listed as a ""double room"", had two single beds at opposite ends of the room. When we asked about alternatives, we were told that no rooms with double beds were available. The beds in this room were also a bit on the uncomfortable side, and the heating in the room was ineffective. The latter problem was solved by extra blankets, which were immediately provided upon request. Having arrived in Berlin from a week with relatives who live without an internet connection, we were keen to get online. As on my previous visit to this hotel, I found the WiFi coverage to be spotty at best. There was no coverage at all in our room, nor was there in the few places in the corridor where seating was available. To check our email, we had to stand in the corridor, about six rooms down from ours. And, even then, the connection went in and out. As on my previous stay, breakfast was excellent and plentiful. The female owner (again, I'm assuming she's an owner -- my understanding is that the hotel is run by a couple) not only put on a delicious spread, but was also very friendly and helpful in providing suggestions and directions for sightseeing. On the whole, I was still quite happy with the hotel, especially for the money. My fiancÃ©e does not want to return, on account of her uncomfortable bed. The place to be in Berlin. Extremely friendly host - we loved staying there for 4 nights. The rooms are nice and clean - no noise on a charming small street right next to the Kurfurstendam. The breakfirst was great - eggs, ham chease fruit and all one could ask for. We could make a lunchbag for the trip home.. we felt like in heaven and there are many angels in pension Columbus. We would stay there again any time and we will never forget the owner - a warm and cozy place - go there! Didnât realise the hotel was part of an old building which shared its access with businesses etc but after initial reservations it didnât prove to be a problem. In fact, it was one of the quietest hotels we have stayed in. Service is/was second to none. The owners and staff are so friendly, efficient and very helpful! Room sizes differ greatly, we had a large double with plenty of space. Our friend, who had stayed there before, had a reasonably sized single. Breakfast was typically German, lots of choice and enjoyed trying new tastes and textures. Free WiFi was offered, a definite plus for travellers. Very handily situated for everything central and beyond. Naturally we would recommend the Columbus. I got to this hotel after a long day of sightseeing, with sore feet and a sore back. The hotel is close to a subway station, only one stop away from the Zoological Gardens, in West Berlin. I was a little confused when I arrived, as I had to ring a doorbell at what looked somewhat like an apartment building. This is more of a reflection on my inexperience than the hotel, but I thought it might be worth mentioning, for others like me, who end up going to the Hotel Pension Columbus and start to worry when they don't encounter a lobby :-) Once my initial confusion passed, and I got upstairs to the third floor, I received a very warm welcome. I was first shown the room I had booked -- one without a shower (shared bathroom facilities on the floor) -- but was then offered, at no additional charge, a room with a shower (WC still shared, across the corridor). I accepted the better room, of course. The gentleman (sorry, I can't remember his name) was very friendly, and answered the many questions I had. He also suggested a very nice Thai restaurant (called Lychee) nearby, which was perfect for a vegetarian student who was travelling on a tight budget. The room itself was quite simple, but everything was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. When I got up in the morning, I was greeted, and asked what I would like to eat and drink, before I made it to the breakfast room. Breakfast was both delicious and plentiful. Having remembered that I had asked for a recommendation for a vegetarian dinner the night before, the owners went to the trouble of preparing a cheese plate for me, in lieu of meat options. I thought this was a very nice touch. All in all, I thought this hotel was great. The only problem I had was that I was unable to connect to the free wifi, both with my laptop and my phone. Not a big deal, but slightly annoying. Still, I would happily go back to this hotel if I ever go back to Berlin.",,,
bobdibest,1013426,"We booked this hotel last minute, and got a twin room for Ã¢âÂ¬70 per night, including breakfast. I was a little worried about shared bathrooms as I don't usually go for this, but the hotel wasn't fully booked and the bathrooms were incredibly clean and not used by anyone but us (that we saw). The room itself was small, but ok, with comfortable bed, working radiator, fan and LCD tv. Each room had a wash basin as well. In this respect the hotel is pretty good, however it is located in a square similar to Times Square NYC and Leicester Square London and the hotel is not double glazed. Therefore the noise at night is incredible. The nightclubs below the hotel and opposite are loud and go all night. Personally we were there to party, so I didn't mind, however be warned, these clubs don't close until 5 - 6 am and only then does the square become quiet. During the early hours it is alive with people screaming and shouting, music playing and general city centre noise. It is very difficult to block out. We were at the front of the hotel so it was pretty bad, I am not sure how the noise compares if you're at the back of the hotel, and therefore not directly facing the square. Difficult one to really review, however it was clean, breakfast was ok, the rooms were fine and service was friendly. Location could be ignored if you're in Dam to party, but its for teenagers, travellers and stag do's, less for families and couples etc. Oh and it was being renovated whilst were there, so may well be even nicer inside very soon. I stayed here with a group of my friends last month. We knew it was a hostel, but weren't too sure what to expect. This is not really a hostel. The rooms are clean and big, beds comfortable, and the guests aren't really the backpacker type. There were kids, teenagers, middle aged travellers and older parties all staying here. The guest kitchen in the basement is the only indication that this is a hotel. The location is good, two metro stops and you are in Alexanderplatz. The train station is opposite the hotel, so it's very convenient. There is a little food and jewelery market just down the road on weekend mornings, and it is right in the heart of East Berlin's Bars, clubs and restaurant district. The area comes alive at night. Highly recommended. Sadly I have no pictures, but it's quite modern decor on the interior I stayed in the Comfort Inn for one night prior to catching the first train to Paris from St Pancras the following day. I needed a budget hotel near the station. I am used to budget hotels, Travelodge, Premier Travel Inn etc, but this is far from those!! I didn't realise that hotels still had single rooms, let alone single rooms smaller than what I'd call a box room. My single room had a small single bed, just about enough space to turn around in and a tiny bathroom. I don't expect much from a budget hotel, but I have stayed in enough Travelodge's to know what sort of size is acceptable for the room price - no matter how central in London the hotel may be. All this would be just about manageable if the hotel spent some money on its decor, which is quite frankly dated and in need of replacing. This was an old fashioned and tiny hotel room which didn't feel too far off those rented by the hour - especially in Kings Cross! I would not recommend this hotel. I stayed at this hotel for a conference in February 2011, so I wont comment on the rate as this was negotiated for the occassion, but the hotel was very nice. Reception is modern, with an area for internet use, and a lounge and bar. The bedroom was large enough, with a large and clean bathroom too. Good modern room, very clean and very comfortable beds. The hotel provides free wifi access which was great. Location wise it required a cab costing about â¬ to the gothic quarter, but the Segrada Familiar was within walking distance (probably 15 minutes). Overall a comfortable clean hotel.","It doesnt really look like a hostel but like a basic hotel. The location is very good since it is in east Berlin and it faces a metro stop and it's located at walkable distance to Alexander Platz and there are some good shops in the area. Staff is most kind and willing to help you in any issue. Breakfast is not included but for 4 euros you can have a all you can eat buffet with besides milk, cereals and jam also ham, cheese eggs and so on. Free wifi in lobby. Price was excellent ( private 4 beds bathroom ensuite for 15 euros per person per day).Highly Reccommended!!!! I stayed here with a group of my friends last month.

Highly recommended. Sadly I have no pictures, but it's quite modern decor on the interior This hostel is next to the S-Bahn station, not a block away 5 minutes away, next to! It seemed brand new when I stayed there in 2008 and what impressed me was the cleanliness and the precise construction of the building. The hostel's design suits it's purpose well and the lobby /lounge area draws you in. Did I mention the place was spotless? Breakfast was the best I had in any hostel in Europe (London,Paris,Florence,Rome,Barcelona) and the nearby supermarket was sooo convenient.",,,
Molly J,2515702,"We traveled to San Diego on vacation with two adults and a toddler (18 month old). We were looking for something on the beach near Mission Bay or Pacific Beach but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. We stayed in Diamond Head for about 3 nights. For our price we had a suite that included a kitchen, living room, and separate bedroom. I'd say the pros are the price and the location. For the price the room is very big and we loved the separate living room and bedroom so that when the baby went to sleep we could still be out in the living room with the lights on and such. Also, the hotel was very family friend and provided a pack-n-play type crib which was already set up when we checked in. The location is just amazing. You are steps from the beach and boardwalk and walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops. We did not have any problem with parking and though we didn't use our car much, when we did we never had too much problem finding a space right in front of the hotel. The biggest downside is that the rooms are a little dated and just not that fresh feeling. I wouldn't say it was horrible or unclear necessarily, but the couch in the living room has seen better days and when we checked in I found pieces of peanuts on the carpet. Also the bathroom is fine but small and the room we were in the toilet seat lid was permanently open since the counter top was sitting on top of the lid. Not a huge deal but with an active and curious toddler it was one more thing to remember. The bed was fine but a little saggy in the middle. I'd say overall the strengths are the price and location. The rooms are clean and functional and a nice place to launch your vacation. We traveled to San Diego on vacation with two adults and a toddler (18 month old).

Also, the hotel was very family friend and provided a pack-n-play type crib which was already set up when we checked in. The location is just amazing. You are steps from the beach and boardwalk and walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops. We did not have any problem with parking and though we didn't use our car much, when we did we never had too much problem finding a space right in front of the hotel. The biggest downside is that the rooms are a little dated and just not that fresh feeling. I wouldn't say it was horrible or unclear necessarily, but the couch in the living room has seen better days and when we checked in I found pieces of peanuts on the carpet. Also the bathroom is fine but small and the room we were in the toilet seat lid was permanently open since the counter top was sitting on top of the lid. Not a huge deal but with an active and curious toddler it was one more thing to remember. The bed was fine but a little saggy in the middle. I'd say overall the strengths are the price and location. The rooms are clean and functional and a nice place to launch your vacation.","We traveled to San Diego on vacation with two adults and a toddler (18 month old). We were looking for something on the beach near Mission Bay or Pacific Beach but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. We stayed in Diamond Head for about 3 nights.

The rooms are clean and functional and a nice place to launch your vacation. We: 2 families with adult children We were friendly received by the front desk staff. Here we got in the morning also coffee and muffins for breakfast. Groundfloor Room: Beautifully decorated rooms with a nice kitchen and dining table. The kitchen is equipped with two cooking ranges and several pots and pans. There is a fridge and a big Microwave, plates, cuttleries, a toaster and a coffe maker, etc. The adjacent living room has a sofabed. The bedroom is also stylish decorated. It has 2 large windows facing public walk paths and therefore we couldn't open the shutters. Only one bedside light was working, their was no plug for the second light! The bath room is nice however the tub has a few rusty stains... But the only real downside: Very expensive WiFi, which frequently disconnects and asks for registration over and over again. After moving on after 4 nights at Shelter Island we arrived early by taxi at Diamond Head, We were able to go to the straight to the room, The rooms were very good & better than expected. The hotel was ideal for the beach & visiting other places by bus which stopped at the end of the road.Coming from England it was good that the reception staff were helpful in giving us information. We had originally booked for 7 nights but stayed for an extra 4 nights as well. I was slightly disappointed with the weather for November ( it was only in the low 60s) but we still got around places without a car as the bus/trolley/coaster services were good & cheap. I would recomend this hotel but you would better to come earlier in the year when the weather is better. Hotel location adjoins boardwalk. Only 2 of 21 rooms have balcony overlooking ocean .Rm201 & 202. Reserve these well in advance. Recent remodel - bold new granite kitchen/bedroom cabinet tops, new carpet, fresh paint&seascape decor. Staff helpful/friendly. Very clean rooms. Parking never easy this close to beach. Parking offered at sister hotel 2 blocks away. Homeless Vets that live around beach are harmless. Down/out former voice of Donald Duck will take change for hand sculpted palm frond flowers. City life guard/beach ranger runs tight ship- no glass bottles, no alcohol, no fires, no smoking , no boom boxes, no overnight sleeping- these rules do not apply if you are homeless vet. Ralph's super, CVS pharm. -3 blocks from hotel. You can get a better deal for price. No vacancy during my 5 day stay. The room has all you need, we had a queen bed, kitchenette with eat in area and bathroom with a large closet. Everything was in good condition except for the carpet, I think that should probably be replaced in the next year or so just to give the place a nice new look. Our only complaint was the walls are very thin, you can hear people beside, outside and right on top of you, when booking I would ask for the quietest room, maybe on the top floor? The front desk was great, they let us check-in early and check-out late and were very helpful about it. The location is great, you only need to walk a minute to get to Pacific Beach, a walk down the boardwalk will take you Mission Beach, a bunch of restaurants and a fun fair. I really liked the hotel itself. I have stayed there at least three times before and have been satisfied. HOWEVER, they lied to me twice about the price of the stay. I called to add a one nights stay and was told it would not cost anything extra because I had Triple AAA. When I got there they said that person was NEW but didn't even suggest a compromise for the extra nights stay. THEN I had to check out early and apparently the same NEW person ran my credit card for one amount minus the one nights stay which I thought was their compromise. I was not told there would be an extra charge on my credit card for that night. When I got home they charged the extra amount. I think this is very POOR customer service. Fantastic location - 5 minutes from wonderful beach. Parking on site. We've booked a room which turned out to be an apartment with a fully equipped small kitchen!!! Beach is wonderful, wide and sandy. You can take a long walk in both directions. In my opinion this is great place for everybody: couples, families, elder people. Restaurants and stores are within a walking distance. Good prices. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room which I definitely recommend highly. The location is great although parking could be an issue. However, the young lady at the hotel desk found us parking and even moved her own car so we could park. The rooms are ok...your typical run of the mill accommodations. they do have full kitchens which is nice. This hotel was beyond our expectations! We travelled with our two kids and booked a suite. The staff was very helpful and kind. The beach is right there. Our room had a kitchenette which was convenient for making breakfast for the family. The beach is gorgeous and the weather was great!! This hotel is very close to restaurants and shops. I am definitely coming back here again when I come to San Diego!! i was very impressed by the great location of the hotel.The front desk people are very kind&eager to please.The rooms are very clean&up to date.The hotel is located a few feet away from the boardwalk so you don't need to wear your shoes to get to the beach.I definitely enjoyed my stay&I will be back many times. Entrance to hotel room was very well lit at night. Unfortunately, the porch light shined into our hotel room, after dark, so brightly it was difficult to sleep. Our studio hotel room was too well lit up. Thank goodness I had eye covers! Otherwise, we were very pleased with our room, which was well maintained, clean and very comfortable. This is the best little Inn I have ever stayed in. Me and my wife had so much fun staying here so close to the beach, clubs and an endless supply of places to eat. I plan on coming back to the PB often and will most likely always stay here. When I arrived there was absolutely nowhere to park. I was told by the registration desk person that there are only four parking spaces for the hotel, and the rest is first come first served. She invited me to park at the sister facility several blocks away and haul my luggage back across town. I drove around until a parking place came open. The room was very nice but there was no view at all. Right across the very small hall (?) a couple of young women were staying and they were in and out, talking on the phone outside and pounding on doors and slamming doors all night long - until 4:30 a.m. Called the front desk to see if anybody could get them to quiet down and nobody answered the phone. I liked the location and the room but the rest of it was not worth the $149 I paid for it.",,,
flojoflojo1,253152,"Hotel Orlanda was fine, and we loved the free internet. However, they charged us 5 euros for air conditioning when it was supposed to come free with the room. We forked over the money because it was 90 degrees, but didn't appreciate it. Room was clean. Location was great. Value was good. But they really ticked us off about the air. Good hotel in the E.U.R. district of Rome. Take the B line to Laurentina, then take the 776 bus to the hotel. Room was large with free air conditioning and very clean. Service was great. Had to get an early cab to the airport and did not have any problem. Would recommend to others.","First, I think this is four star hotel, but the room is not nice and clean at all. I think they should take ""suite"" off. They not reserve. the wifi is unusable at all. only breakfast is good. I wouldn't call this a four-star hotel, however it was nice, clean, and quiet and we enjoyed our stay. All the people working at the front desk were nice and accommodating, and the night bartenders were friendly and helpful as well. The rooms are large and the bathroom is well set up with the vanity separate from the bath/toilet. We found the location just too far away from the action to be convenient. After our first trip on the bus/metro (for us was quite confusing...) we found it would just be much easier to rent a scooter so that we could do things on our own schedule. The breakfast was delicious with tons of options, which is a good thing, because you will want to eat it-- otherwise you will be starving by the time you get to Rome's center. Overall the only thing we disliked, other than the location, was that getting WiFi is ridiculously expensive at the hotel and there was no inexpensive options in the immediate area that we could find. Otherwise, a great hotel for the price. I flew into Rome's Fiumicino - Leonardo da Vinci airport and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights (march 6-9, 2012). I went the Tourist information center at the airport and purchased a Roma Pass there. If you plan on visiting many museums and using the bus/Metro system, I highly recommend getting a Roma Pass. At the airport there's a bus that takes to you Rome's city center (right near the Termini Station) for 4 or 6 euros (i can't remember but it's the cheapest way to get into the center). It's a good hotel in the E.U.R. district of Rome (however, it is pretty far from city center where all the cites were). You can take the B line to Laurentina (it's the last stop on the train). It's about a 25 minute ride from Termini stop. When you get out of the train and walk up the stairs, stay to your left. Exit thru the doors that are on your left. As you walk thru the doors, there are rows of bus spots on your left. Bus #776 will take you to the hotel. I think bus #776 is parked in slot #1. The ride on the bus is about 10-15 min. (one passenger told me that it's 6 stops away, but sometimes the bus driver doesn't stop at every stop so either ask the driver or keep your eyes on the road)! As the bus goes down the road, the hotel is on the left hand side. At night time, there are blue neon lights saying ""Hotel"" to help you spot it easily. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I had no problems checking in at 1:30 in the afternoon. My room was sparse, but large. My room was like the size of a little apartment in NYC. There was a living room, and when you open another door, it leads into the bedroom with twin beds. My living room had doors that opened into a little outdoors patio. It was really nice. The beds are comfortable. It was clean, and the showers had great water pressure. The bathroom was pretty large as well. Very nice hotel in Rome. There was also free breakfast in the morning (basic continental breakfast)! It's pretty close to Ostia Antica if you plan on visiting the site! My family try to call me and like for 20 minutes nobody answer the phone, and finally when someone answer the phone, she was extremely unpolite and she never apologyse, she just said ""what u need"", so finally i just ask her the room number; then and the front desk we asked her about the roma pass and she said "" i 'm sorry i don't have time now but there was noone else at the front desk. This is the trip of our lives in europe in the are giving us a bad image for tourists and i mean i am a travel agent I stayed at Eur Suite Hotel for one night at the beginning of October 2011. Unlike some other places we stayed at, which were apartments made into small hotel, this place was an actual hotel. We found the internet to be quite expensive (you could only get the 20-Euro-for-10-hours package). On a more positive side, the staff person downstairs was friendly and allowed us to use her computer free of charge for several minutes so that we can do a check-in for our flight! (how nice is that??) The room was clean and spacious; in fact, it was two rooms: a 'living room' and a 'bedroom'. The down side was the location of the hotel. In order to get there, you have to go to Laurentina station and then take the 776 bus (which was a little tricky as you don't really know where to get off and have to ask people on the bus). The hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to go out in the evening to eat, your only options are a small pizzeria or the hotel restaurant (we ended up choosing the hotel restaurant, which we found to be good). Also, to get to any city attractions, you would have to take the bus and then the metro. The reason we chose this location in the first place is that we naively thought it would be easier to get to the airport from there than from Termini station, for example (since it is closer on the map). We were wrong: we actually had to take the bus back to Piramide metro station and then a train to the airport (while from Termini there is a direct train). Overall, except for the location and the price of the internet, we were quite happy with the hotel. Good hotel in the E.U.R. district of Rome. Take the B line to Laurentina, then take the 776 bus to the hotel. Room was large with free air conditioning and very clean. Service was great. Had to get an early cab to the airport and did not have any problem. Would recommend to others. Stayed at the Eur Suite and I was really happy overall. Spacious room, nice bathroom, lots of closet space, refrigerator, small tv, seperate living room. Great breakfast but get there early for plain croissants (versus the ones with icing on them). It was smoke-free and even had a balcony. The staff was really accomodating. The only downsides were that you can't control the temperature and they add a $18 Euro fee per person even though my trip was prepaid. $18 Euro is nearly double that US plus whatever my credit card charges so I wasn't happy about that. The location was pretty far away but fortunately, the train station is just a bus away. Don't walk to the nearby restaurants, they aren't that great. Catch the bus towards the train station and there are some cool places along the way. The kebab place and Gelatto were my favorites. There's also a grocery store across from the train station so stock up on water and fruit for the fridge :). this hotel was a bargain short drive to all historical rome. dont need public transport. when in rome park anywhere (disengaged the handbrake) Stayed on this hotel recently to check what is a business hotel in Eternal city...SInce these are suites, it is very nice size, plenty of space and decent ammenities. One problem is the location which is by far the only downside of the venue. It is at south end of new part of Rome EUR and any ride to or from the city will take approx 1 hour. Benefit of the locaiton is relative proximity to the airports... Excellent hotel if you travel by car. It has private FREE garage, excellent staff and restaurant. Great spacious rooms. Best value for money. A group of 10 from our church were in Rome for a week and stayed at the Eur Suite Hotel. It is in a lower income area of Rome, but we were never uncomfortable. The staff was very helpful and always had someone there who was fluent in English. The rooms were the best part. Very large and spacious. All had a large living area in addition to the bedroom and bath. Air conditioning was good...sometimes you just had to ask the desk to turn it on. It was cool a day or two while we were there and they opened the windows and turned off the A/C. A refrigerator, safe, and blow dryer in each room. The buffet breakfast was acceptable, but couldn't describe it as delicious. It was exactly the same every morning. We did have dinner at the hotel one evening and it was fine, just not something to rave about. 15 euro each included water and dessert. The bus stop is just around the corner from the entrance of the hotel. Bus 776 takes you to the Laurentina metro stop which is the last stop on the line. From there it's very easy to get wherever you want to go in Rome. A week's metro pass cost 16 euro and covered the bus, metro, train, and tram. It does take 30 to 40 minutes to get to the tourist areas, including waiting on the bus. We never waited over 20 minutes for the bus. One day we were short on time to catch a tour and we took 2 taxis (5 in each taxi) . It cost us 36 euro per taxi to go to the Vatican area.",,,
Keith W,1188927,"Started with a phone call. Joseph B. answered as was more helpful than what you might be used to. A friendly and helpful person on the other end brightens your day even if it had been a challenging one. I had to deal with some court issues there in Dallas Ã¢â¬â not a favorite thing for any one, so, I just wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t in the greatest of moods to have to spend my hard earned money on a hotel close to the courts. Surprisingly, I found that the rates at Crowne were quite reasonable plus you still get the five-star treatment. When you are in town and need to be close to the action, give Crowne a call and ask for Joseph B Ã¢â¬â youÃ¢â¬â¢ll be glad you did. Thanks Joseph. For the rates of this hotel, you would think that guest could expect a warm shower. Two of the four mornings that we were there, the shower was ICE cold! The second morning I called the ""At your service"" line and was told that the cause was ""because of a cold snap that had come through area"". This was a new one.... I would hope that the facilities management of this facility would investigate the issue. Upon check out, the clerk never asked how our stay was.

Beautiful hotel, just needs improvement on the service area. My favorite little hotel in Mexico City. The same staff has been there for a long time and they know me by my first name. It has been remodeled. Convenient to the Metrobus. A short walk to the Zona Rosa. Rooms are a little small, but pleasantly decorated with a European style. They even let my dog (a small bichon) stay with me. The restaurant is pretty good if you don't feel like leaving the hotel. They will send a SUV to the airport to pick me up, usually less $$ than the registered taxi. However, unless you're comfortable with the lifestyle in urban Mexico, it would be better to stay at a brand name hotel. I live in Colorado and my best friend lives in Florida. I met him in Pensacola Fl and we decided to go over to New Orleans for a night. We forgot that the final four was going on. I looked on all the travel sites to find a hotel and I found The Crescent Palms Motel. I called a cab and it was taking forever to get there so the motel staff ask were we going and we told him to the French Quarter. So he locked up the office and gave us a ride over.The staff went above and beyond. We have stayed at three of the higher end hotels in the French Quarter and didn't get the service that we did at The Crescent Palms Motel.

Beautiful hotel, just needs improvement on the service area. I booked online so I wasn't familiar with the hotel when I arrived. The internet rate is like half the regular rate. But, even then... the room is dilapidated. The window was cracked. The toilet seat was broken. The carpet was threadbare. The few pieces of furniture in the lobby was falling apart. I went to the restaurant for a cup of ice, and the rude woman/maitre d' told me if I asked her again, she was going to charge me for the ice. The kitchen was open to the dining room, and looking at it, I didn't bother eating there even with the complimentary breakfast. My wife and I researched many places to stay in Key West to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The Pier House was a great place to stay. You are in the heart of Key West, one block from Mallory square going in one direction, 2.5 blocks from the harbour (great places to eat) and right on Duval St. Our room was in the ""Spa"" building, large balcony with a semi-view of the water. Side balcony looked out to the water. Large shower with a waterfall head, you could really relax. Room was large and bright. Having a beach at the facility was great, you could go to the pool or Gulf without having to travel. The beach is not large but we did not have any problems finding a perfect place to sit in the sun. Staff at the beach set up chairs and towles for you, this was a nice touch. The pool was just recently re-opened after the pool deck was replaced. One nice thing about the pool deck, you always had sun this area was not shaded by buildings. Food was ok, the Cuban French Toast for breakfast you have to try, this was really good! (had the French toast on a couple of days)The grounds had outstanding landscaping. For the rates of this hotel, you would think that guest could expect a warm shower.

Beautiful hotel, just needs improvement on the service area.","This place is a classic motel that has been recently renovated. Clean, quiet and Kendall, the manager was extremely hospitable and helpful. There's nowhere much to walk to nearby from here, but it's a short drive from Uptown, Loyola and Tulane Universities and the French Quarter. I saw the reviews online for this motel and thought I'd give it a try...never again. First off, the location is beyond horrible. The beds were itchy I had to spray them with Lysol just to stop the itching. The room I stayed in was halfway clean with dirt in the bathroom's floor cracks and pubic hair in the shower. The staff however are helpful and friendly but please don't make the decision to stay just on this. There are motels 2x better than this for the same price. Also they write your credit card number in full on the check in paperwork when asked about this I was told that they shred it once payment has gone through. Crescent palms motel was the best deal in new Orleans when I stayed there during jazz fest. The motel is only 5 mins from the super dome and the French quarter. The staff was very friendly and the rooms are super clean. I couldn't cab since the city was very busy and the motel staff brought me to the French quarter. The price couldn't be beat anywhere in town, the value was there! I would recommend the Crescent Palms Motel to anyone traveling to new Orleans especially looking for a great rate. I live in Colorado and my best friend lives in Florida. I met him in Pensacola Fl and we decided to go over to New Orleans for a night. We forgot that the final four was going on. I looked on all the travel sites to find a hotel and I found The Crescent Palms Motel. I called a cab and it was taking forever to get there so the motel staff ask were we going and we told him to the French Quarter. So he locked up the office and gave us a ride over.The staff went above and beyond. We have stayed at three of the higher end hotels in the French Quarter and didn't get the service that we did at The Crescent Palms Motel. Hands down, the best value I found during this Mardi Gras season. I couldn't abide by spending $200+ a night in the French Quarter and looked for a better value. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crescent Palms Motel. It is about 3 miles from the heart of the French Quarter. It is located at the end of MLK and I felt very safe in the surrounding area. I did not notice any foot-traffic or loitering on or around site. Off-street parking is available inside the courtyard of the motel. The on-site manager was genuinely nice and courteous, and when there were no cabs available just before a big parade, he took us to our destination along the parade route. Also, the motel is located along RTA bus route 28 which runs right to the corner of Canal St and S. Rampart, and at $1.25 per rider, that can't be beat. Cab fare was about $10-$12 fron the Quarter to the motel. The rooms were very large and the full size beds were comfortable. The mini-fridge was a nice addition, large enough to keep our sandwiches and beverages cold. The bathroom was cute, renovated in a retro style and reminded me of the Art Deco district of Miami Beach. I would gladly recommend this motel to anyone looking for a clean, safe, and economical stay in New Orleans! As soon as we drove up we were scarred to get out of our car. We walking in to a room smelling of smoke and a transvestite/prostitute hanging around in the lobby. When we asked about our reservations they could not locate them. We saw that as a sign from God and left immediately. I smelled of smoke the rest of the day after only being in the lobby for a few minutes. Then came to realize I was charged for 2 nights on my card. Spent the morning trying to clear the whole mix up. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Crescent Palms on our first visit to New Orleans. We arrived late at night and, at first, I was a bit concerned about the surrounding neighborhood. Not necessarily because of personal safety, but because I was moving across country and my car was packed to the brim with all my important belongings,as well as two cruiser bikes attached to the back and a thule on top! (We were concerned about safely parking the car the entire trip) Upon arrival these worries were soothed as the motel offers gated parking that are locked every night at 10pm. We were greeted by the night manager Kendal, he was super cheery, checked us in quickly and showed us to our room. He explained the t.v. had died earlier that day and he had just brought in a brand new flat screen. This quick response to a minor problem is a sign of a well run establishment! The rooms were spacious and impeccable. The pink retro tile in the huge bathrooms was adorable. The furnishings were simple yet comfortable and clean. The decor in the office and bar were fabulously mid-century modern that matched the exterior of the hotel. So cute! The bar was tiny and smoky, but filled with interesting characters. It made for a relaxed and entertaining evening. The next day the vivacious female day manager, (I forget her name) explained the best routes to get around the city on our bikes. She gave great advice. We explored the french quarter, garden district and everywhere in between. The neighborhood around the motel looked much nicer in the daytime (old folks sitting on the porch waving to us as we pedaled by). We arrived back to the motel in time to sit on the car-port roof sip some beers and watching the sun go down over NOLA. I loved my stay at the Crescent Palms Motel, and felt great about supporting a local business revitalized after Katrina. You can read more about the history of the Motel on their website, or just ask! The location was a terrific taste of life in residential New Orleans away from the drunken tourist trap that is the french quarter. Overall our stay was refreshing thanks to the great staff! Stayed at the Crescent Palms Motel for two weeks in Oct. 2010 with co workers and the Motel is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful! Motel is located 5 mins from the Super dome, me and friends were able to walk to the Saints game. The wireless internet is free, they have a bar on site with video poker machines. We did weekly rates of $270.00 per week and thought that was a great price. I would stay again!! Marc",,,
ElleBklyn,2194532,"I spent a week at the TMH recently. Overall it's a decent hotel that most people should be comfortable in. It doesn't have a lot of frills but it was clean. The staff was helpful and courteous. I wouldn't say they were overly friendly, they kept their distance but were always available for directions, suggestions and even kept an eye out for my traveling companion to the point of letting us know when we kept missing each other in the lobby. The breakfast spread is better than many that I have experienced in Turkey with a wide range of cheese and meat as well as fresh vegetables, breads and cereals. The only disappointment for me was the scrambled eggs. There was a large vat of them each morning that were runny enough for me to look at them twice before I was certain they were eggs. I'm sure her are some people who like their eggs runny, I'm not one of them. The coffee was very good. My room, while clean and well appointed, was very small and rather noisy. I would suggest getting a high floor (I was on 4 which is the 5th floor in western numbering) and not on the front side of the hotel. I was also surprised to find two small twin beds. I was [sadly] alone so I just needed one but i am used to queen beds when I travel so it was odd. Overall I would recommend this hotel as a saw bet at a good price. I was put up here by a client on a business trip a few months ago. The first tip I'd give someone is to make certain your taxi driver knows where you are going. In the two weeks I stayed there I didn't find a single taxi driver who could find the place. Print a map of the area before you go and show it to the taxi driver. The hotel is in a largely residential area so if you want local culture, you got it. IT's a few blocks walk to anything, but if you can manage 10 minutes of walking you'll find great restaurants. I'll try to remember a few of them and post future reviews. The rooms are simple and on the small side but very clean and comfortable. I checked out a few of them during my stay and I would say that higher floors are better. I did get a chance to see one of the suites on the top floor as well. It was very nice but had no shower just a tub. The hotel restaurant serves a nice, basic breakfast. I'm mostly a ""Just Coffee"" kind of gal at breakfast so I didn't have much but others seemed pleased. There is no laundry service. Our two week stay challenged my clean wardrobe. I ended up buying a bucket and soap to do laundry in my room. I later picked up a fan to help dry things. Apparently there is no laundry service in Istanbul. None. This is what we were told by the hotel staff and by our business contacts in Istanbul. I see a business opportunity for someone. The hotel staff was pleasant and professional but if you want any actual help seek out the younger of the front desk staff. I have forgotten his name, but he has a bit of a birthmark on his face and you'll know him by his cool charm and friendliness. Overall, I'd say this place is a good deal and worth staying at.","I was put up here by a client on a business trip a few months ago.

Print a map of the area before you go and show it to the taxi driver. The hotel is in a largely residential area so if you want local culture, you got it. IT's a few blocks walk to anything, but if you can manage 10 minutes of walking you'll find great restaurants. I'll try to remember a few of them and post future reviews. The rooms are simple and on the small side but very clean and comfortable. I checked out a few of them during my stay and I would say that higher floors are better. I did get a chance to see one of the suites on the top floor as well. It was very nice but had no shower just a tub. The hotel restaurant serves a nice, basic breakfast. I'm mostly a ""Just Coffee"" kind of gal at breakfast so I didn't have much but others seemed pleased. There is no laundry service. Our two week stay challenged my clean wardrobe. I ended up buying a bucket and soap to do laundry in my room. I later picked up a fan to help dry things. Apparently there is no laundry service in Istanbul. None. This is what we were told by the hotel staff and by our business contacts in Istanbul. I see a business opportunity for someone. The hotel staff was pleasant and professional but if you want any actual help seek out the younger of the front desk staff. I have forgotten his name, but he has a bit of a birthmark on his face and you'll know him by his cool charm and friendliness. Overall, I'd say this place is a good deal and worth staying at. Well the interior of the hotel was nice, EVERYTHING ELSE terrible! The location, the room size, the staff, Everything! We needed a reasonably priced hotel for our family travel (which included 2 babies). We found this Hotel based on TripAdvisor. Chose it due to its proximity to the American Hospital, which we visited. At first taxi drivers could not find the Hotel; but it was useful to have the phone # of the Hotel, and they would ring and get precise directions. The hotel is close to the Osmanbey metro and to the Nisantasi area. Sole disadvantage for us as a family was the hillly, difficult to climb streets. So if you have a walking disability, better not choose this hotel. If you're into sports, choose it! Comments on TripAdvisor are correct. Rooms are newly furbished, clean, pleasant. I would not say they are small; Internet is indeed very fast and free (I appreciated this most of all; as it was key for me to stay in touch with work); the bathroom is very nice; cosy; and plenty of hot water. At first the airconditioning was not working properly, but upon request the manager resolved that. So we were happy. Breakfast is not that great. Don't put much expectation. It is a minimum to survive. I hope this improves. I would choose this hotel once more if I would need to be in this area. If you're in Instabul to visit the Historical Site, do not choose this Hotel; choose something in Laleli region. Otherwise, you will have to take the Subway, then the Funikuler, then the Tram, just to get to the Historical Site. Choose this Hotel if you need to visit Nisantasi (great shopping area) or some Malls like Cevahir. Hotel staff is very polite; and helpful to call a cab, or to give directions. I chose the Hotel for the combination of Location + price; call them, prices are a bit lower than nearby hotels; it is probably because their location isn't exactly central street. Chosen for the right purpose this Hotel satisfied all needs. Stayed in Husa Vizon in September which was right when it opened. Brand new, spotless clean, good value for money, friendly and very helpful staff. Loved loved the bathroom. Its a block away from Nisantasi (an area I personally loved) and a 25' walk to Taksim Square or 5' walk to Osmanbey metro. Would definitely stay there again. I enjoyed very much the Husa Vizon hotel. I stayed in a superior room, bright and spacious; even better than what I imagined: free wifi, big working desk, safe- all what I needed. At the beginning, was a little bit worried of the location due to one of the comments, but nothing further from the truth. I booked the transfer from the hotel which is quite affordable and found that the hotel is in a very quite location full of wholesaler textile shops. In order not to get lost in all those small streets, I have asked reception staff to give me a detailed map of the area and could so discover that in less than 15 minutes I had reached the chic street of the luxurious fashion designers, Abdi Ipekci and plenty of nice restaurants. I would recommend it to everybody who is looking for a quality and affordable hotel in Nisantasi. Ive been on a business trip in september 2011. The hotel actually surprised me. At the begining i was thinking it would be hard to find it after reading the location was a bit hidden, but then you realize it is close to everything, it takes only some minutes walking to everywhere. Its is a new hotel with excellent service, very clean and has a very good spa also. I would definettly recommend it.",,,
henri_s,199370,"I stayed here with my partner in March 2011 for one night. This was our 2nd stay (first one was a year ago). The hotel still looks new and very stylish. Location is wonderful, close to shopping, KaDeWe department store, and nightlife. We were lucky to see very friendly staff throughout our stay and got an upgrade to a junior suite in the cylindrical area of the building on the 6th floor (highest) which was fantastic! The room had an outstanding bed and panoramic views with two small balconies. Everything was top-notch and pleasurable. Our first stay was in the city room and this room option was definitely much better! The rainshower was wonderful (even though couldn't turn the water colder for some strange reason - maybe it was broken?). Wellness was on the same floor which was practical and a great place to enjoy the outside jacuzzi after shopping in the city. We had dinner in the hotel which was great and for us reasonable priced. Internet costs 9 euros for 24hrs but worked fine in the room and hotel restaurant. The hotel seemed quite empty and you didn't get a crowded feeling at all (although it was weekend). This is a great place to stay at if you're in Berlin and looking for a stylish place near shopping and SchÃ¶neberg nightlife! Staff was very friendly. This is a new hotel, very stylish, in SchÃ¶neberg near the bars, cafes, and KaDeWe department store. Location is very nice. Be open-minded to stay here. Rooms are nice, had a city room which was large enough for German standards. Everything was in black and gold. Rainshower with reddish glass wall is amazing! Too bad they have carpet floor (the air was bad in the room with a lot of dust). Wifi was not free but they have 2 computers in the floor. Fitness was ok, but tiny. Wellness area (spa) is nice but the sauna is not hot enough and it can get too cruisy here if you're looking for relaxation (especially on weekends). Dinner was great, enjoyed it once, wonderful wines on the menu! Breakfast is below average in hotels of this standard in Germany - and overpriced. Nearby are great alternatives for less than half of the money. Breakfast staff was nice although they ran out of many things easily (like cold cuts), and once I asked for more and got it (but hear the cook say from the kitchen ""den stinknormalen Schinken???"" which is quite rude meaning that does the ""customer"" really want the ""average ham"". That was annoying. The overall experience was good and I recommend this hotel to couples and citybreakers. I stayed here with my partner for a weekend city break and had a good experience. The hotel is small and situated close to shopping and bars in Berlin. Our room was on the 4th floor. The room was clean but small, with windows toward KaDeWe rooftop. In the room there was a large LCD TV and the free wifi worked well in the room. There was no fridge or ice machine but we could get some ice cubes from reception upon request. Shower/WC was very small but clean and no mold here. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment. The breakfast area is lovely and the lady working there very friendly but the selection was not of a high quality. We have had much better bread rolls in other hotels in Berlin earlier, and the cold cuts were poor quality. Juices and fruit salad were good. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the location is great but it's weakest point is the quality of breakfast. It might be a good idea to book it without breakfast and eat out at one of the coffee shops nearby. I stayed at this hotel with my partner and brother in Oct 2010. We had a deluxe double room with an extra bed. It is a good hotel and I recommend it to friends too. The exterior looks very nice. Bellboy was friendly and helpful. I requested a high floor room and a street view but we got a room on the 4th floor with no view at all (instead saw a brick wall from the window). Receptionists were very friendly and attentive. They gave us tips on where to go eat etc. The room itself was a standard size, with a pretty wooden floor and a private bathroom. One of the lamps was not functioning, I called the reception and they would immediately send a guy to fix it. Very nice! There is an ice machine downstairs but could not find an ice bucket in the room (used a plastic bag). The A/C unit was loud and we could constantly hear noise/buzz from the downstairs supermarket (A/C unit I guess). The supermarket has a wonderful selection of organic foods and good sandwiches. The bed was wonderful, no bedbugs here! The room had an iron, an ironing board, and a safe. The flatscreen TV was by LG - a good one. Wireless internet connection was fantastic and we could use it at all times without interruption. There was no breakfast so we went to eateries nearby. We used the gym once, the treadmills were ok, but some machines were out of order. We were the only people I could see in the gym during our stay. During at stay the hotel was construction the floor we stayed in - a good sign - but there was some noise at daytime. One of the elevators was not functioning at all during our stay - didn't bother us though as we're sporty and went jogging to the nearby Central Park daily. The location of the hotel is excellent on Broadway and two blocks from subway. I would like to stay here again as it is a good middle class hotel with great service and a good room - but some downsides too. I stayed at this hotel with my partner and brother in Oct 2010.

I would like to stay here again as it is a good middle class hotel with great service and a good room - but some downsides too. I stayed here earlier this week with my partner for a city break in Berlin. The pension is family-run and has a central location at Wittenbergplatz close to KaDeWe department store. There is a grocery store next to the pension with opening hours till midnight Mon-Sat. We had a ""Komfort-Zimmer"" room on the 1st floor with windows to the square. The room was lovely. Spacious, beautiful decor, comfortable bed, LCD TV, and a small WC/shower. There was no furniture for storing clothes which could be problematic if you stay for a longer period of time. The pension offers free wifi and it worked perfectly also in the room throughout our stay. The lady at reception was very friendly. Breakfast was good quality but small selection. They offer wonderful fresh bread rolls, good cold cuts and cheeses but no warm dishes. This place can be reached easily with U-Bahn as the next stop is in front of the building. We definitely recommend it to people who are not looking for luxury but good and affordable accommodation in friendly surroundings (and with a personal touch of a family business). Location is also great for shopping and nightlife.","This was my 2nd stay in this Hotel. The warm welcome through the GM Antje Last gives you the feeling to come back home, the hotel is hidden because the reception and the the rooms begin in the 2nd floor. Because there are only 29 rooms, you feel the family atmosphere everywhere: at the reception, in the salon (smoking room divided) and in the breakfast room. Very good breakfast. The room No. 32 was fabulous, very spacy, about 4m hight, new bathroom with elegant black floor, flatscreen, sofabed, and everything in a typical old-berlin-style. If I go to Berlin I will stay in this lovely 3-star hotel or in top-luxury-6-star-hotel Hyatt, not somewhere between. I stayed here with my partner for a weekend city break and had a good experience.

It might be a good idea to book it without breakfast and eat out at one of the coffee shops nearby. Nice hotel location. Heating not properly regulated an dslight smell in room (nothing to incommodate). Lovely personal taking nice care of customers. Limited TV programs if not in german. Very close to U12 metroline. I chose this hotel for the gay Easter Leather meeting in Berlin for it's perfect location, reasonable prices and free WiFi. When I tried to log on I found that all the gay social networking websites I needed to use to stay in touch with friends were blocked - Gaydar, Recon, Eurowoof, even the websites of some of the Berlin gay clubs. The owner was unsympathetic and unhelpful and claimed that she needed to 'protect' any children staying there - which is surely the job of their parents. If that is her attitude she should make it clear on the hotel's website - but no doubt she doesn't want to lose the Pink Pound, Dollar or Euro which from which she probably does very nicely, given the hotel's location. Otherwise the room was large, though the bathroom was little more than a cupboard, and the bed very comfortable. It was annoying that though the room was a non-smoking one there was a persistent smell of smoking coming from somewhere. Breakfast was adequate, though someone needs to teach them how to scramble eggs. The staff apart from Madame was friendly and helpful. We arrived in Berlin for the last 2 nights of our fabulous vacation. Got off the train and decided it would be fine to walk to the hotel. It was pretty far! We should have taken the train's welcome rep's advice and gotten on the U-Bahn. The U-Bahn stop for the hotel is just across the Ku-Damm! The hotel is very quiet and our room was pretty large and very accomodating. Not so for the bathroom, however. It was very, very small. The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. The receptionist was the friendliest we had on the whole trip. He couldn't help us enough. The night before we had to leave for the airport he called a taxi to make sure we had one early. We went to the Italian restaurant just up the street (one block up on the right on the same street as the hotel) and had a wonderful farewell dinner. We were the first ones at breakfast the next morning and it was a really good spread. The receptionist from the previous evening sat us on the balcony - really a nice way to end our trip. Thanks to all of the Trip Advisor reviewers - all of the hotels we stayed in were wonderful during our trip through Italy, Austria and Germany! The location for shopping is very good because its just on the side of KaDeWe the biggest department store in Europe. For sightseeing is great, the hotel is 100meters from the U-Bahn station that has the 4 lines leading to the berlin center. It is also very confortable, the beds are soft enough and the room is nice and big. The breakfast is also a highlight. Everything fresh and lots of choice. Tipical food is also a plus. The hospitality really makes a differece, because germans are not known to be friendly, but in this case you feel part of a family. They speak english and french. Also very practical. In about 5min you have your room clean and towels changed. Amazing! I trully reccomend for someone looking for a quiet hotel to go with the family, traveling alone or in couple. Mybe for business travelling is a bit too much familiar and not so many internet connections. For sure is not for teenagers or trouble-seekers. Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in a room 308 using choicehotels points. It was considered a smaller room facing the coutyard, but it was OK for us. The room was very clean. The location of the hotel was great for sightseeing The hotel itself is very charming and cozy. They offer free breakfast which was adequate. We took the express bus from the airport to Tiergarten and took taxi to the hotel for 7 euros. On the trip back we just walked to Tiergarten - it took about 15 min. Hotel staff recommended a wonderful restaurant. We took a free walking tour and went on 1 hour river tour. Both were very enjoyable. The audio guide on the river tour was wonderful in both English and Russian languages. Also took a trip to Potsdam on our own and got a bus tour in town. After travelling to many countries, I have to say that Berlin is on top of my list. I would certainly recommend it. Superb place to stay, KaDeWe is just around the corner :) bars and restaurants also just around the corner! you have got everything in one place! parking is also 5meters away, 13euro per day. Rooms are ok, everything you need is there, breakfast is perfect fills u up for the start of the day! I stayed in room 17, large and clean room. For the travellers who like to stay in modern hotels this might not suit, the hotel has its own style, and is not so modern inside! One thing I did not like, that there was no bar in the hotel, but anyways, I had everything what i wanted around the corner, there I could enjoy my double JD with coke with my g/f . P.S I recommend you to take a taxi and go for a meal to a restaurant called ENTRACOTE, very close to checkpoint charlie. best french cuisine in Berlin. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights July 2010. The temps in Berlin were 94 degrees. With No AC. Not a lot of other things matter. The location was great, the rooms were clean. But after waking up with the sun baking thru the window & not being able to stay in the room again until after the sun went down. It goes to the bottom on my list for summer stays. If I go to Berlin in the winter I would stay here again. The window did open up wide & there is a fan in the room. But we were not able to get an extra fan. Also, the beds were comfortable to me, but just box springs with comforters on top. No mattresses. And the elevator does not go to each floor. It goes between the floors, on the staircase landing. So, if you cannot manage 15 steps up to get to the elevater then 15 steps down to your room this is not the hotel for you. Lastly, the attached bathroom is very small, but functional. US branded chain should have the basic USA hotel standards & AC is a basic standard. Very friendly staff. Excellent location near the KaDeWe. Rooms are comfortable but basic. Very small bathroom in my room but I think that there are larger rooms. Very clean. Excellent breakfast for a 3 star hotel. Negativ: the lift that stays between floors, you have to carry your bags up or down the stairs. Value for money. Free WiFi in rooms and one computer in public area If you do not like big fancy modern hotels and prefer small family quite places - this hotel is your choice. I stayed in this hotel for a shopping weekend. I couldn't have wished a better location for shopping! KaDeWe was just around the corner, several big shops and a plenty of small ones around. The hotel was old fashioned, but really nice. The staff was helpful, breakfast realy astonishing with all the fresh fruits and self made curd, I enjoyed it very much! The rose in the bathroom made this stay very spacial. There's really one BUT: if you like big modern, well furnished hotels - like Swissotel sutuated nearby, for example - you may not like this one for its old fashioned mood.",,,
moony606,230104,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights, and we weren't expecting much, since the price was so low. However, it was a wonderful surprise when we spoke witht he friendly staff and entered our lovely, clean room. The beds were comfortable, the shower was great and there were free bottles of water everyday. The street noise is loud, so bring earplugs if you have a problem sleeping. The staff were very helpful with directions and recommending places to eat. Internet is free in the lobby. The hotel is literally right next to the Vatican! Breakfast was bleh but included in the price. They put Nutella inside a chocolate croissant WEIRD. You also need to get to breakfast eraly because the seating is limited. The only downside is that the metro is not very close to the hotel. So if you have tons of luggage or are exhausted after a long day of sightseeing, getting to the hotel from the metro is agonizing. We would definitely stay here agian, bringing less luggage and splurging for a cab from the metro station. Right in Dam Square, this hotel took us by surprise in the lobby. It was very extravagant and interesting. The room, however, was very old but the bathroom looked newly renovated. So we had a good balance. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The view out our window was another brick wall, but I guess that's to be expected. As long as no protests are going on in the square at the time, this is a great place to stay and decently priced during off season months. The room was very hot, since there was no AC and it was NOT clean. There were stains, dust and crumbs on everything and hair all over the bathroom. The shower had no nozzle and the pressure was low. We didn't ask for a different room, so I'm not sure how they would have handled the complaints. The good things about this hotel were that the metro to Amsterdam was a 10 min walk (not good if raining), the staff spoke English and was very helpful and the television had the Discovery Channel in English! The restaurant was good but pricey. This place is great for city trips because the metro is cheap and the hotel has free parking, but that is it.","location is not inconvenience, take tram #45 to the last stop, and then walk about 15mins - 20 mins from station to hotels....really far away from city centre.... but, rooms are nice, reception are nice too I can see the sun rise by the riverside from my room. We can see the sun rise even lied down on bed...and listen the bird singing..My new husband & I were very happy...romantic morning I will pick it again, if I have no heavy package. and for leisure The room was very hot, since there was no AC and it was NOT clean.

I have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel and found it to be good with plenty of parking spaces and very helpful staff both on reception, in the breakfast room and restaurant. The rooms were very large and comfortable with very clean bathrooms. The breakfasts were excellent as were the evening meals (although there was not a large choice) it was cooked and presented to the hightest quality. I would certainly stay at this hotel again. Stayed at the Tulip Riverside for 4 nights as part of a group. Nice hotel with good sized, clean and comfortable rooms. Plenty of storage, clean comfortable bed, large clean bathroom, desk, small table and chairs. My room was at the front overlooking the main road, but no issues with noise. Staff were friendly and helpful, especially with some of the older members of our group. Very good breakfast - scrambled eggs, bacon, cereals, fresh fruit salad, bread, rolls, cheeses and ham, plenty of tea/coffee. About 8km out of city centre, but got taxi in (approx Ã¢âÂ¬30 - not too bad if sharing). Evening meals were good. If you don't mind the location, I would recommend this hotel. We stayed in Tulip Inn for 2 nights on the August end long weekend. It was quite far from the city and took an hour to reach there (vs. 20 mins mentioned in their website) as the direct Metro was not working. We took a bus and then a Metro to reach the nearest station from where it was a 15 min walk (and again i would not call it as FEW mins as their site says). This was the worst part as we had to spend a lot of time travelling to city centre which is what we went to visit. It is a basic hotel located near the river. Rooms were quite large and comfortable and the place looked beautiful in the morning after the rains. There was no kettle etc to make tea/coffee. Breakfast was good. Overall recommended only if you have a car and you get it at a good price I was at the Tulip Riverside while I was attending a Conference at the Amsterdam Medical Centre. Following was my experience: 1) Excellent Parking Space. 2) Reception counter - poor service, though we had booked in advance there was a great chaos on our arrival. 3)# Rooms: Lack a Fridge ,Coffee mug and my heater wasn't working. The shower kept on leaking and the bathroom used to be wet perpetually. #Being close to the road ,the noise level was high and occasionally I used to be woken up. #Internet facility wasn't available when i wanted it most. # Room service was abysmal. # NO safe locker. # Charging wall-socket at a very inconvenient place. 4) FOOD: BREAKFAST:Not up to the mark as it should be in any 3 Star hotel. You cant get an omelette at breakfast. Dunno about lunch and dinner. 5) LOCATION: 20 minutes walk to the closest station. really out of the city.Taxi takes 30 Euros to take you to Amsterdam central. 6) Value for Money; Poor. (You pay the price of a 3 star get the service of a non-star facility OVERALL CONCLUSION ; AVOID THIS HOTEL IF YOU CAN!!!! Our impression of the Tulip Inn Riverside was that it is a decent enough hotel for the price it offers, although be aware of the following; the location is pretty far from the city centre even with the metro..., the closest shop is also a bit too far away to walk and have to take the bus....also take care of the bathroom floor: Extremely slippery, my wife slipped and broke her hand while stepping out of the bath (this is a warning in every hotel with only a bath tub...this hotel cannot be singled out in a negative way because of this....but do take care to lay a towel on the floor if you have slippery tiles on the floor :-)... we prefer to stay a bit closer to the centre when we return to amsterdam though... and there are better alternatives for the same price . My room was overlooking the river. With this view and the spacious accommodation, it would have been a perfect place. The place is however a bit run-down already and needs renovation. My phone was also not working. The reception kept on hanging up on me, because they could not hear me. Also, there is no internet connection. I expected a Tulip hotel to have one, and that's why I booked it. But well, I should have researched before deciding. I would only recommend to families and other non-business travellers. Rooms ok but, far from city center. Food (raw pork for dinner) and service (almost non existent ) terrible. Got short changed with paid inefficient internet services. Not a pleasant place to stay.",,,
lcf-guy,109474,"In the bare-bones singapore hotels, this seems the best of them. I liked it better than Fragrance-Selegie: better rooms, free-wifi, though no free (but bad) breakfast. The problem I had was the wifi generally was very bad, requiring constant re-login. The hotel does many things well (TV, music, bath, bed), but fails on things which should be simple. The wireless, if it works at all, is very slow. You can only see the TV from the bed. There is no real desk to work on (I write this on a nightstand with a stool). It does have a frig, u'wave, and dishes for people who want to eat in their room (good luck finding groceries around, though!). The rooms are large by SF standards, but with trendy, uncomfortable furniture. This would be ideal except for the tiny pool. This is very strange for a family type place.

The features & exterior look like most Holiday Inn Expresses, but my room was really run-down. The lamp was broken, the carpet the dirtiest I have ever seen, and the bath in need of renovation.

Everything was very nice (though the ""fitness center"" was two treadmills and a weight bench) and the breakfast was impressive. We slept well and had no trouble with the room, the staff, or the location. I found the room very clean and fresh, the bed was very comfortable! The evening social hour was a nice touch and the host, Stephanie was nice! The features & exterior look like most Holiday Inn Expresses, but my room was really run-down.

I usually only think to write a review if I had a bad experience, to warn others. But I liked my stay at the Holiday Inn Express so much that I decided to write a positive review. The place succeeded on every level for me. The service was first-rate - every worker has a nice greeting for you. The rooms are nicely appointed, are very clean, and the beds were so comfortable. And the complimentary touches were great - a free american hot buffet breakfast awaits you when you get up - eggs, bacon, cereal, bagels, and fruit - and you even get free drinks at happy hour along with hot appetizers. The price was excellent. And the location was surrounded by major restuarant chains within walking distance , close to anything you'd need to get to. I would definitely come back. This was one of the best Holiday inn Express i had stayed in long time. This hotel ranks above many I've used in the past that cost far more. The place was convenient to everything (including our HQ). It was kept immaculately clean. The staff was outstanding to deal with. I felt like I was in a 5 star resort. My room was quiet and comfortable. The hotel even arranged to have us picked up by limo (on their dime) at our HQ since their shuttle stopped service at 6pm. And on the day we were leaving our Yellow Checker Shuttle never showed up to take us to the airport. On a last second request the manager allowed one of the staff to take us 17 miles to DFW without charge! We still tipped the driver well for saving our butts and getting us to DFW on time. I am having everyone in my agency stay there from now on. This is what service is all about.",,,
Ian C,604930,"Let's get one thing straight - this isn't a 5-star hotel. Turn up expecting 5-star luxury and you'll be disappointed. However, neither does it charge 5-star prices. My wife and I spent three nights here in January. Having the combined directional senses of an orange we were pleased to see the hotel from the train as we pulled into Amsterdam's main railway station. The reception area was most impressive, the staff courteous and helpful. 5-star all the way. Then we found our room. And that's where things go 3-star. Alerted by previous reviews, we'd asked for a quiet room and we got it. Perfect. It was clean too, and the bed was comfy, but it was so, well, tired. It would be an exageration to say we spent our evenings waiting for the valves to warm up on the TV but the last time I saw such an aged device was on the Antiques Roadshow. So why does this review give a score of 5/5? Because we paid peanuts for our stay, because the location is brilliant, because the room provided us with exactly what we wanted and because the staff couldn't be faulted. We ate in the hotel only once and that was for breakfast. We'd heard it was a tad pricey but we thought it might be something mindblowing. It wasn't. It was a let down so we ate out after that. In summary, ignore the 5-star rating, accept you'll be staying in a well-priced 3-star hotel, ask for a quiet room, skip the breakfast and you won't be disappointed. We weren't. We found the Oxford was a really good hotel: virtually all the staff spoke english and were genuinely friendly and helpful. The room was of a good standard - including a safe (-no extra charge), fridge, air con as standard. WiFi is free in communal area but an extra charge in the bedrooms (-no big deal). The Tv channel choice was limited to Sky News, CNN News & eurosport, so we ended up watching italian or spanish Tv instead, which was no bad thing and helped to get a feel for the local culture! The breakfast was outstanding - as much as you can eat, with cereals, breads, jams, juices, croissants, danish pastries, boiled eggs, etc, etc! It kept us going until the evening meal! Drawbacks: In house restaurant had limited choice for evening meal, but there were plenty of nearby cafes (-try the backstreets) I also read someone say it was centrally located.. whilst this is true, I would say it's more on the edge of the main tourist area. We walked pretty much everywhere and did not find it a problem; Here are some approximate walking times from the hotel (-we are a family of three with an 11 year old): Spanish Steps (Piazza d'Espagne): 10 mins Trevi Fountain: 10 - 15 mins Roman Forum: 20 - 25 mins Collosseum (Flavian amphitheatre): 25 mins Piazza Navona: 25 mins Vatican: 60 mins Termini station: 10 -15 mins Nearest metro stations: Termini / Piazza Republicca, Espana, Barberini Note: all day travelcard valid for metro/bus/tram inside the city was about 2.50 euros per person per day! The lady at the front desk was very polite despite her not understanding English very well. The price was $20 cheaper than the Econo Lodge at the other side of the parking lot and had the same rooms. There were not many people there. The room smelled strongly of some sort of cleaning product, just cant think of what it is. The floor, furniture, and beds were clean and the sheets/ blankets smelled good. The t.v. worked good for an older model, about a 28"" screen. The bathroom was clean but there was water spots everywhere, and we wiped the toilet seat off before sitting on it. The room was very dark, not the best lighting. We only heard one siren from an ambulance at around 10 pm. There was a group of individuals in the ""pool"" area at 6 am yelling at each other and one kept saying ""what da f***"". That was very rude and annoying. I believe the same group was up for several hours earlier banging on each others doors and being very loud. I believe the rooms should be priced at around $45 a night.... Many positive points, a few negative, but for the price it's hard to complain. The location of this hotel is great - on top of an MRT (tube) station, close to the Arab Quarter and Little India and the centre of town generally, and you can easily use the MRT to come in and go to the airport. Rooms are small but clean, though with some design flaws (e.g. room light switches are next to the desk rather than by the bed). Basic points were not explained at check-in (e.g. you have to collect your own laundry and pay as you go); and housekeeping was slow to clean the room. The 4th floor pool area, where breakfast is served, is pleasant, airy and spacious, though the pool was surprisingly cold. If you're from the UK, think Premier Inn. We have just returned from a long weekend in Paris at the Agora Hotel. The position is perfect just a short walk from Notre Dame and close to restaurants etc whilst being quiet. The rooms (we had 2) were a good size for Paris with excellent showers. They also had mini bars and safe. Both rooms were in good order with modern decorations. We had breakfast in the hotel each day - eat as much as you like. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We would use it again without hesitation. We spent four nights here and were delighted with our choice. Our room was a good size and well equipped.The location is excellent for walking to the main sights and for access to the Metro and there are lots of really good cafes and restaurants nearby. Breakfast was extremely good and the staff were really friendly. The staff on the front desk speak excellent English and were very helpful. I appreciated the free computer use and the roof top terrace is great for views over the city and just soaking up the sun. We will definitely return.

We stayed here for a night on New Year's Eve after arriving from the UK on the way to Indonesia - good location for us (close to airport, plenty of good local restaurants) and a large, comfortable room. Great rooftop pool. Italian restaurant seemed over-priced but then you don't go to Singapore for Italian food. I never write reviews however this was the best experience that I had at a Marriott chain. I am Gold member through Marriott & have stayed at many chains. The most notable was the customer service. I had booked my hotel using my United air miles. All was good and had the confirmation # from both the 3rd party company booking the reservation and then got my reservation/confirmation through Marriott. Upon arrival/check-in, they could not find my reservation. After some research, they found out that the 3rd party company cancelled my reservation. I never got an email and they claim they don't have history of it. We know the 3rd party company dropped the ball because I had the Marriott confirmation #. Anyhow, during this process the employees at the front desk were very friendly, always keeping me confident, and happy. One employee, I believe her name was Fernada, eventually was the one to get me checked in. There was a computer glitch that she had to follow up later to fix and she did. There was also a discount that she allowed me to use even though you can use it booking online. She went out of the way to make sure I got a room and didn't have to worry about anything so I can enjoy my vacation with my family. They even offered by champagne a couple times during the process :). The reason we chose that place because it was right next to SeaWorld. We just walked over to the park. The inside is beautiful and spacious and alot to do. Surprisingly the price is very cheap for being such a vacation spot. Again, the best experience at a Marriott chain, best customer service, great rates! Awesome! Definitely will stay there again! The Bayswater Inn Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!! It is clearly a low end budget establishment, which is not what their website would have you believe. I will list the reasons below: *The hotel is smelly and dirty *The ""beds"" are metal framed camp beds with thin hard mattresses - almost impossible to sleep on, I had to put the quilt underneath to get some comfort *The TVs don't work *The rooms are supplied with polystyrene cups to drink tea/coffee - I had to insist the hotel provide me with a proper cup *The windows are not secure, can't be locked and my room had a flat roof outside *My room stank, the carpet is filthy and the walls are dirty *The bathroom still had remnants of previous occupants (won't go into detail....) *The doors bang with an alarming volume - wakes everyone up if you don't grab the door before it impacts with the frame *The staff are less than helpful and just advised me to complain to my booking agent!!! It was a dreadful stay and I would never go back again. On the plus side, it is quite close to Bayswater tube station and the location is quiet.","I would definitely NOT recommend this place. Spent the night there while in B'more overnight about a week ago. First, let me say the rooms STINK and smell of cigarettes (we had a non-smoking room); the minute you walk in the smell of smoke hits you smack in the face. Second, the walls are extremely thin, you could hear couples not only on both sides of you having sex but the couple above us I thought was going to come through the roof you could hear them, I truly expected the bed to crash through the roof at any minute (also, while sounds of sex could be clearly heard, there were family's there with children in some rooms) I truly hope that couples were not in the rooms with children doing their ""thing."" The KILLER of it all was when I awoke the next morning, I had a strange bite mark below my lip on my chin which I later found out was a BED BUG BITE! My wife freaked out because she's a nurse and she said she thought it was either a mosquito or spider bite based on the circular pattern of the bite mark, I saw my doctor who confirmed what it actually was. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to the place of business ever again. The lady at the front desk was very polite despite her not understanding English very well. The price was $20 cheaper than the Econo Lodge at the other side of the parking lot and had the same rooms. There were not many people there.

We got this motel just to stay overnight after a club.(we are from VA came for a party to Baltimore). So... at 5PM we checked in... the place (not a room) smelled as a pee. When I saw a room i am started crying (I am from a different country, was traveling a lot ... but I have never seen something like that)... A room was dark, very-very old and smelled as a cigarette (very very bad), I got a headache right a way (I am 25). Also a weird guy was watching us from a car parked on the side of a motel (the guy was still there after we came back to check out in one hour (thanks God, Hilton had rooms available.) And of course these ppl didnt give us a money back (this two Indian dudes were never at the 'front desk' and we had to wait for them 20-30 mins each time we wanted something). I am usually never leave a reviews, but please, don't go there.",,,
bsballbabe,586863,"Esposizione Hotel is in a fantastic location. Close to the Colosseum, other sites, the Metro and the train station. Our room was quiet and the bathroom larger than I expected. The halls do echo so you can certainly hear when someone shuts their door or walks down the hall. It was great being able to open our room windows for some fresh air and not get any street noise. Plenty of restaurants/bars, places to shop and there is a grocery store across the street and up a block or so. It was nice to have a small refrigerator in the room too. The elevator is very small and no more than 3 people w/o luggage can squeeze in there. We were on the 4th floor and primarily used the stairs. After long days walking it would've been nice to take the elevator, but it was being used to move belongings/items to another floor or there were people already waiting for the elevator. Keep this in mind if you have someone in your party who may have a challenge with stairs. A nice suite with a large bathroom and comfortable beds. Plenty of room to work and free wi-fi! The thermostat responds quickly if you need to heat or cool the room. Several places to eat at the Venetian and if you want to try something else you can go over to the Palazzo as they are connected. For those who like to shop, there's plenty of that too! For those who would like to eat healthy and be in a completely smoke-free environment, go to the 4th floor cafe at the Canyon Spa. Good menu though the cafe is only open until 2p. The downside to the Venetian is that it's not connected to the monorail. You'll have to exit and walk to Harrah's. Also, the lighting is a bit on the dim side with the exception of the lighting over the beds. Large tub and shower. Though our room was non-smoking we were able to smell cigarette smoke in the bathroom which lead us to believe that perhaps the floor beneath us wasn't non-smoking and the smell wafted upwards to our room. This must be how the other half lives! Only blocks away from the action, Windsor Court is a beautiful hotel. My suite was spacious, the turndown service was a nice touch and the staff helpful, friendly and courteous. The fitness center was better than most. I was there for a business conference and our company sponsored breakfast & lunch at The Grill offered some healthy alternatives (credit should be shared by our company's astute event staff) with some New Orleans favorites. The lounge appetizers were also tasty. There was some construction noise during our breakout sessions which the hotel staff addressed quickly when notified. Otherwise a fantastic stay! This hotel is off the beaten track, but very close to the metro which was great (4 stops from Las Ramblas). There are very few open restaurants in the neighborhood so if you come back to the hotel you would need to hop back on the metro for food and nightlife. It is a nice respite from the hustle of Barcelona. The rooms are more than adequate and very clean. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. There are concrete floors in the hallways so noises echo. There is a charge for Wi-Fi and the breakfast is a bit on the high side (8 euros) for the quality. There is a bar in the hotel, but it never appeared to be open. A nice suite with a large bathroom and comfortable beds. Plenty of room to work and free wi-fi!

We took the airport bus (about 5.10 euro) from the airport to Placa Catalunya and then caught the subway to the hotel. We walked up by the giant library in the Lesseps square to our hotel. There is also a supermarket across the way! The hotel is nice. You can hear people from upstairs rooms but we slept great. We got a triple occ. and the 2 beds were full beds and one twin. All were comfortable. Some street noise from the cars passing below but its a really quiet residential neighborhood. Our bathroom was clean and we had hot water all of the time! Not too shabby with 3 girls! Room was a decent size and we had a safe and hair dryer but only 3 clothes hangers. There is also an ironing board but no iron. Lots of outlets. The wi-fi isn't free but it reaches to the second floor. No mini fridge but we turned our window into one. (Hey we went in Jan/Feb it was super cold outside so we kept our water and snacks out there. lol) Reception was nice and helpful. They spoke English! :) You'll see most people in BCN don't! So brush up on some phrases in Spanish! There is breakfast for extra $$ but we never tried it. There is a soda machine and water machine too. (I'd recommend going to the super market and having water on hand no matter what time of year you go) The hotel is next to Park Guell so you can leave that for your last day if you want to relax and walk around the neighborhood. There is also a bakery by the library and a shop with lots of tourist stuff for cheap further down. For 3 girls in Jan/Feb we loved the place and we'd def stay again! Remember you get what ou pay for. A warm, clean place to sleep. If you want luxury then suck it up and pay for it. visited for 4 days. weren't enough to enjoy the city to its maximum. LOVELY destination to get to. has everything you could wish for. Hotel was average. rooms seemed a bit decadent and not redecorated for a while. requested double bed but was allocated to 2 singles. Price was very affordable. Receptionists were very helpful. Cleanliness up to standard. only problem were the dark corridors! felt like i was in a morgue! otherwise it was very good location. close to metro station and hop on hop off bus. barcelona made it worth it tho! This hotel was slightly out of the main centre, but very close to a subway station so it was only a quick trip on the subway to get into the centre of town (on Saturdays the subway runs 24 hours). We took the airport bus (about 5 euro) from the airport to the central Plaza and then caught the subway to the hotel. Took about 30minutes for the entire trip. We didn't have a great map, but even so, finding the hotel from the subway took about 10 minutes. The hotel itself was pleasant. Some street noise (but nothing that earplugs didn't fix). The bathroom was clean and we had hot water all of the time. Room was a decent size and we had a safe and hair dryer. No fridge. Didn't find the counter staff to be especially helpful, but the locals were more than willing to point us in the right direction. This hotel is also near one of the stops for the Turista bus (red line/ blue line) which was very handy. A lovely restaurant down the road and lots of bakeries and coffee shops dotted around. There are 2 mini-supermarkets 1minute down the road from the hotel. All in all this was a perfectly acceptable hotel and we would stay here again. Located in a very quite neighbourhood. Not that far from the metro station, hence moving around is not a problem. Counter service is excellent. Special mention of Mr. Marco Belviz, very friendly, helpful and gives appropriate advices at all times. Hotel services can further be improved on: 1. equip the room with kettle 2. thermostat control on air-con 3. wash room cleanliness. In conclusion, a good choice for travellers. Close to Metro, Clean Rooms : Cleaned daily, fresh towels, Some English TV stations. Room walls a little thin can hear next doors tv. Staff friendly easy check in and check out. Could use thicked bedding as rooms can get really cold during the night time but overall a good clean hotel. This hotel could be nice but misses the mark. I am not sure why there are so many good reviews. If the beds were comfortable we may have given it a better review but they are like boxsprings with a blanket thrown on them. At least 1 English station (even CNN) would make this nicer for Americans. The room was clean except for the filthy shower. Even worse, no AC after October so we had to go to a local store 2 mins away and pay 25 euros for a fan. Sorry, we can't recommend this no-frills hotel. They rate it 3 stars but we barely give it 2. PROS- Great front desk staff - Very helpful. In room safe. Morning breakfast bar was good, cheap and convenient. Only 2 blocks to Lesseps subway station. Neighborhood appeared safe. Good restaurants within 10 min walk. CONS- 1. Noisy area - construction across street, busy traffic on front and side streets, could hear walking in above room till 3AM every night, could hear water running down pipes from above rooms. 2. No english TV stations. 3. Very hard beds. Double bed was just two singles pushed together. 4. No air conditioning. Clerk explained that AC is turned off in entire hotel in October so only heat. Temps were in 70s so had to keep window open and listen to constant traffic including mopeds and buses. Thermostat in room does nothing as heat controlled by computer at front desk. 5. MILDEW ridden bathroom. Other than this bathroom was cleaned everyday. They need to learn what bleach is. 6. Expensive internet - 3 euros an hour. 7. Had to go to front desk to get TV remote first day. This hotel is off the beaten track, but very close to the metro which was great (4 stops from Las Ramblas).

There is a bar in the hotel, but it never appeared to be open. Location: Good location, close to the Lessep metro station. From the metro (line 3) it is easy to get to all the sights you want to visit as a tourist. The hotel is also very close to Park GÃ»ell, I can recommend a visit there. Several supermarkets close to the hotel (50-100m). ATM 50m from the hotel. About the hotel: Friendly staff, clean rooms, air-condition and quite at night. They have WiFi but it is not free. You get great value your money. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Friendly staff, clean rooms, quiet, working air conditioning, near Parc Guell. Normally, I like to stay in hotelswhich are located in the center of everything, where all the action is. When I saw this hotel in the Internet, the price was half the cost of what other hotels in Ramblas cost. As I was on a budget and knowing that the hotel was located 3-5 minutes from a metro station, I decided to take a chance. My experience has been very positive. Service from all the 3 reception managers was outstanding, clean and modern rooms, ample bathrooms and the neighborhood is nice with casual and simple cafes, bars and restaurants. It is not located in the center of everything, but who cares as long you have a metro station which can take you anywhere, especially if it is only 4 metro stops from Ramblas (15 minute ride). Actually, it would be safer to stay away from Ramblas which can be dangerous at night after 11pm. Also dont expect great exterior visuals from your room windows. This is the only setback. All the rest, is great. I would definitely recommend it A great surprise, the room is good and the bath is new and clean. The bath include a jacuzzi and hair dryer.The room has a great space including a desk. It's near a metro station and it's in a quiet neighboorhood. The hotel is renovated and the people is friendly in all services. The rates are very good.The location is near Pq. Gaudi, but the other attraction are 3 or 4 station. The problem for a couple is the bed, because there's no double or queen bed, they make a double bed with two twin beds. The air conditioner has a temperature control but work just to cold or hot, you can really control it. There's a fast internet for a small charge and the breakfest cost 8 Euro each. I recommend it for people looking for a good hotel spend not much money with a reasonable confort. There's a great commerce near but not much things working 24h.",,,
Sadorek,430003,"Of course hotel is cheap and situated near metro station and southern parts of Central Park. But the rest isn't good. Rooms are big, but dirty and dark, staff is unkind.

I was looking for cheap and good hotel in Singapore, this one friend told me. The pictures of this hotel look better than in reality, the room was dark, air-conditioning too cold and the bathroom dirty. Hotel is situated in the district of Little India, for some it's an asset, rather I did not like neighborhood, but it is well comunicated with the center.","Singapore is an extremely expensive city. If I had paid $55 a night in somewhere like Thailand and got this quality of hotel I would have been disgusted. However, Singapore like I said is much more expensive. $55 is considered ""budget hotel"" and therefore you get what you pay for. Bed is pretty much a mattress on the floor, everything in the bathroom gets wet when you use it. There was some mold in the bathroom which was pretty gross. However, the location is not bad, 2 minute walk to subway where you can hop on and get all around town for a good price. If you are just looking for a place to sleep at night for a decent price it's not bad, but don't expect much! Stayed for a week in Feb. The room was basic, furniture creaky, and bathroom stinky. One is prepared for stinky bathrooms in budget hotels in Singapore (although I've definitely seen better ones), but what was terrible, was that the only plug point in the room had a loose contact, resulting in audible arcing. Of the 3 lamps in the room, one was not functional. Neither problem was resolved during my stay, despite complaints. The lift was not working one day, resulting in a climb up 4 levels of stairs. Construction activity in the neighbourhood was forewarned, but the firealarm going off at 0300 hrs, was unexpected. Worse, the same went off twice again on other nights. False alarm, but couple that with the plugpoint The front desk staff were courteous. But beyond that, i guess, i should have spent the 20 Dollars extra to go to other hotels in the neighbourhood. The external and communal areas of this hotel look great - but the rooms unfortunately are not. They smell of damp, are on the small side and are in nee of an update. The location is okay - you'd pay more if you were more central and as long as you are willing to use the MTR (underground) to get around it's fine - about a 5 minute walk from Farrer Park station (exit B). There's not a lot to do in Little India though, although there's a shopping centre about 5 minutes walk away that has food outlets. Free wifi in the lobby worked well. Stayed there only for one night. Friendly staff, clean yet small rooms with TV and aircon. Close to MRT Station Farrer Park and to Little India. A bit noisy due to construction works (Sep 2011), also close to some temples. Better than expected. Not as noisy and dirty as some nearby hostels, a good choice for independent travellers who are not extremely tight on budget. Wanted a clean moderate price hotel with basic comforts- just the opposite, it was smelly, the air-con leaked and flooded the room, the toilet sink leaked, the power points very hidden under the bedstead. Only one door of the cupboard could be open, the other was right behind the bedstead. There were no door hooks to hang the clothes, bed blanket smelt musty and was very dusty- not an ideal place to stay in singapore- i would definately not go there again. only plus point it was near the shops and mrt stations. the staff were not so friendly and helpful either. With Singapore being expensive, I'd rather save my dollars on the hotel and spend them on other things. As we were in Singapore at a busy time, and it was alast minute booking, our options were limited and we ended up at Asphodel Inn. On arrival, I was immediately hesiatant, there seemed to be people hanging around and it became clear, it is one of those 'transit' hotels that rent rooms by 2 hour periods. Anyway, when we did eventually get checked in, the rooms were functional and everything worked. The hotel isn't really close to anything, and it's even quite a walk to the nearest MRT or bus stop. It was around 15 minutes to Mustafa Centre, so that was reasonable as we needed to go there. There was wifi which only worked in the lobby and was totally hit and miss so I gave up trying to bother. There are other places much better for the same rate so I would not stay here again for that reason. My family and I stayed in Asphodel Inn. We found the rooms clean but a bit small for a family with 2 children. the hostel has wifi internet at the lobby area only. The price is inexpensive, but the location is not so good as it is about a kilometer away from the nearest commercial area, and the nearest MRT station is 3 blocks away. this hostel is okay for those who don't mind walking for several blocks or those taking the taxi always. Asphodel is just the right place if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheap! Being a student, I was low on budget and this place served the purpose. However, what was special about this place is the service was impeccable. The receptionist had a smile on his face even @ 3 am and the check in post midnight was not a problem too! This is a good place if you traveling to Singapore on a short trip and want to save a few bucks. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. Highly reckon this to budget travellers. Next time I am in Singa, this is where I would be for sure. Budget hotel...but OMG what a location!! Walking distance to train, great Indian Restaurants, Football Stadium and all of the great shopping that Little India has to offer!! Staff were ever friendly and always willing to help. The rooms themselves were a tad on the small size...but hey your in Singapore and you should be out enjoying all this great city has, not sitting in a hotel room...so as somewhere to sleep after a hectic day and to recharge those batteries for tomorrow then it's perfect!!! please save yourself the heartbreak. DO NOT STAY HERE!!! tiny and filthy. bed was disgusting. had to sleep on a airline blanket we had taken from the plane. a prostitute and a ""customer"" were booking a room as we arrived. staff were horrible. ruined what was the going to be the best holiday I have ever had. We also stayed in Hotel81 in little india. Much nicer, cleaner (A/C was a bit cold though) we on purpose booked a fairly cheap hotel in Singapore. The first trouble was finding the hotel. We took the subway from the airport, got off at the right station - which had 4 exits. Make sure you check on google.maps beforehand where you need to go. The taxi drivers also had trouble finding the hotel because the Racecourse Road makes a funny, unexpected turn. This beign siad, the location of the hotel is awesome, it's right in the middle of Little India, lots of restaurants around, and once you know your way around the subway station is in waliing distance. The lobby of the hotel is newly renovated and looks welcoming, the staff is friendy and we were happy to find an elevator. BUT our room was tiny tiny and very basic, no fridge but the worst thing was the black mold in the bathroom. Do note this is a very basic hotel. After reading reviews I thought I got a good deal and was expecting a hotel with no facilities but i was expecting it to be clean. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by staff who barely spoke a word to us, took us to a twin room with a double bed. We had asked for a non-smoking room but we immediately knew it was not a non-smoking room. It stank of cigarette smoke and there were cigarette burns on the bedspread. The room was tiny and there was only a tiny cupboard and table to put belongings on. The tv was in the top corner of the ceiling and it was tiny. There was no room for luggage and so we spent all our time in the hotel room stepping over things. The bathroom was reasonable though could be a bit cleaner. The main disappointment was the bedroom and the lack of cleanliness in the bedspreads and towels provided. Also I do not believe that a ""non-smoking"" room exists in the hotel, because despite the cigarette smell they insisted it was a non smoking room. The location was pretty good because it was close to a MRT station, but other than that there is nothing much around the hotel. Wireless internet was a pro. However if I had a choice I would pay a little extra for a nicer hotel that I could actually enjoy. It just wasn't worth the price even though it was cheap. ""Welcome to Asphodel Inn Singapore"" greeted the receptionist as i apporached the front desk. I noticed that it was dusty and wet, obviously, this was a very ancient place. and at the corner of my eye, i noticed some dried up white goo(not sure what it is but smells familiar) in the table just beside. without even uttering a word, she threw the room card at me and showed me the way. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful. Not those kind of hotels where you are treated as family, but instead like one of their own. As i entered the dark and cosy room, i unpacked my belongings and as i put my things in the cupboard i saw a long black figure shaped like a sausage just lying there. Just before i was able to grab it. The receptionist quickly snatched it away and said 'have a good day' before exiting the room. I looked around and said, 'i could get use to this!'. so small rooms with cockroaches and just one thing is better the situation BUT IT IS NOT WORTHY AS I PAY $ 70 per night it deserve only $ 25 I was looking for cheap and good hotel in Singapore, this one friend told me. The pictures of this hotel look better than in reality, the room was dark, air-conditioning too cold and the bathroom dirty. Hotel is situated in the district of Little India, for some it's an asset, rather I did not like neighborhood, but it is well comunicated with the center. The sheets and towels were filthy, the room was not cleaned any of the 4 days we were there. I had to go to the front desk and ask for more toilet paper. I'm pretty sure they were renting out some rooms by the hour. Gross, gross, gross....",,,
shedevil49,232874,"Nice staff, lovely breakfast ,uncomfortable bed .The nearest underground is Bologna but watch your belongings on the metro somebody cut right through my handbag and stole my ipod.It is only 4 euros for a day pass on the metro you can get off and on as many times as you want no good if you have walking difficulties though. Very nice hotel, the bathroom was huge , the bedroom was great , location brilliant. I agree the breakfast could be better a bit of fruit would be nice","Rooms-no sound proof,very noisy. I can even hear the sound of the bed and the lady having sex on the next room.VERY DUSTY underneath the table.Worst of all they gave two single beds put together for me and for my husband. How can we sleep together? Toilets-TERRIBLE SMELL.UNBEARABLE. Staff-can't understand/speak English. Breakfast-all the same everyday, no choices. Internet access-VERY POOR Nice staff, lovely breakfast ,uncomfortable bed .The nearest underground is Bologna but watch your belongings on the metro somebody cut right through my handbag and stole my ipod.It is only 4 euros for a day pass on the metro you can get off and on as many times as you want no good if you have walking difficulties though. The place, price, breakfast, attitude and services are great. Makes me love Rome more! If I return to Rome, I will choose this hotel again! Well placed medim-smoll hotel.Nice and friendly staff at reception and breakfast room(mention for the 2 young girls from Moldavia and sig.Alfredo!)Good raport price/confort.Excelent breakfest buffet.24 hours free access to internet and coffe/thee in the lobby. The hotel is indeed terrible. I hoped the previewous comments I had read at tripadvisor, saying that the hotel is actually okay, however it wasn't! It's far from being a 3-star quality; the staff didn't know English, the rooms are hostel-like, the WC was quite a disaster - there was not decent door, neither a place to put the basic toilet stuff like shower gel, etc. To put is in one line - it's a hostel, not a hotel!!! Prior to booking this hotel i took a quick llok at the review, and, to be frank, got a little scared, but the price was so much better then all the other options i decided to take my chances-and was not sorry! Folks, this isnot the ritz or george V, and you must not excpect it tt be! This is a 3 star hotel in a major westren european city. I have been to many such hotels and this one is certainly up to par. The bedroom (single) was more then reasonable in size (there was even a small balcony), clean, the towell wwere chaned daily (even when i did not ask for it), and the room was also cleaned daily. true, the bath room was small (the only place to put the soap bar or the toilet paper was on top of the toilet;s water rservoir), and the sink was not in the bathroom but in the bedroom. Breakfast was very reasonable. Given the price I would certainly recommend it to my friends My brother and I stayed in this hotel while I attended an academic meetings at the nearby University of Rome and stayed afterwards for a couple of days of sightseeing. The hotel is in the university district and some of the life on the adjoining streets reflects a vibrant university atmosphere: it is only about 15-20 minutes walk from the central district from Termini and also has convenient metro stops only a few blocks away for those who want to go further afield. The hotel's furnishings are not fancy: however, the staff was unfailingly courteous and helpful; the breakfasts were plain, but filling; and the price for 8 days' accommodations were more than reasonable. I enjoyed my time at Hotel Athena and will gladly stay there again, if I ever have the opportunita to return to Rome. Ok so I picked this hotel after about 2 hours of looking online for something not to cheap and dingy, close to the city centre in Rome and not too expensive. On arrival to termini station we got a cab to the hotel, â¬8 so not too bad, however the hotel is only 6/7 minutes walk from the bologna blue line metro stop (handy to get downtown/Vatican/coliseum) The taxi driver stopped as he turned around the corner of this one way street, got out of the cab and pointed at the building in front of us,'athena' he says, no more looking like a hotel than a cat looks like a dog! Anyway up we go to the door and it turns out the hotel doubles as an apartment block, we got in up to reception which is on the first floor and got a big hello from the guy behind the desk. He gave us all the info regarding breakfast times, our keys and directions to where we would get a late night feed(it was 10.30 at this stage) The room was big, a double and a single bed, perfectly made, towels and ac, TV and fridge and a decent en suite, spotlessly clean also. I cannot fault this place, if you are heading to Rome for a 3 day action packed tourist weekend to see all the sights, this place is perfect, I mean it! If you are going for a romantic 2 day getaway you may want to pick somewhere else, it's no 4/5 star in that market. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable, they will give all the usual stuff, but then spend a few minutes explaining where and how to get to where you want to go, very helpful indeed Overall - 3 day tourist break ***** Location - **** Staff - *****",,,
SKF976,608423,"have to agree, price/location is great. Now be aware of the night club, and u can feel the noise and vibration until easily 3.30 am. I couldn't define if some of the bars are ""escort bars"", so think twice before to book if in family or in couple. Staff is present, I havent found them friendly, and not sure of their sens of service, but might just have not be my day on that one. few steps away from metro, nothing to complain about cleanliness, staff nor facilities. A very good option for future stay.","Where do i start: this hotel is terriable,not very clean rooms,bathrooms mouldy, no hot water staff at the front desk very rude, hotel night clubs keep you up till 3am, I think they need tips to smile, be aware if you get there in the morning you cant check in till 2pm even if you are told by paying in advance like us that this would not be problem.If you want your holiday to be spoilt then please do check into this hotel. have to agree, price/location is great. Now be aware of the night club, and u can feel the noise and vibration until easily 3.30 am. I couldn't define if some of the bars are ""escort bars"", so think twice before to book if in family or in couple. Staff is present, I havent found them friendly, and not sure of their sens of service, but might just have not be my day on that one. Decent rooms but ask for the same on the third floor suites are good the RATSKY disco a must see and must do on the visit I spent four nights at the Karama recently. Overall I enjoyed the stay. The rooms, although dated, were clean and the staff was friendly, helpful and attentive ... much more so than other more expensive and higher-rated Dubai hotels in which I have stayed. There are several varied nightclubs, each with different themes. The location is also convenient as the metro is just a few meters away (literally) and there are several good restaurants and groceries stores in the immediate vicinity. I would recommend the Karama for a budget stay in Dubai. However, I am giving it three stars because of the food prices (very high .... ouch). My friend and I had two cups of won ton soup and one soft drink and it was almost 70AED. This hotel is all about Budget and you get a large size room for your money.... good for a limited budget! We stayed there on our business trip with some female members in team. The hotel is average and within budget. But sine it has night clubs & pubs, may not be advisable for professionals. May be good for groups and couples. The food quality was very good. but the room quality was average. I had stayed here four times, the recent one was on 16th of september. They have wonderful staff at the front office. The rooms are big, although not very modern, but they are kept in a good condition. I have read many reviews that the hotel is noisy at night. obviously when you have night clubs in the hotel, it would be noisy. that is agin one of the plus points of the hotel. I t has a veriety of night activities, it is diversified into bar, pubs, dance bars, night clubs. U can say all under one umbrella. I chose this hotel specifically for its nightlife. I dont understand why this hotel has had so many bad reviews. I dont recommended it for families but for the single traveller. There are 4 nightclubs and other bars mainly full of filippinos. It is noisy of a night but what would you expect with 4 nightclubs on the ground floor!! I asked for a quiet room and they gave me one. Also free buffet breakfast with Indian theme. We were a group of 6 persons stayed at Karama. Rooms are bigger in terms of its size but upgradation and improvement in service etc required. Ideal for the people who wants to enjoy in night club etc. They have three or four clubs. From that angle, you cannot expect a calm and quite stay or ambience. Front office staffs were cooperative and accomodative. We did not face much inconveniences as we were group who would love to have night life enjoyment. Food and internet services are expensive. Pool has to be maintained more professionally. Last year again I went to DUBAI for my business deal so I had booked hotel KARAMA .Rooms are really good & clean. Hotel karama is location is good it is center of the karama area everthing is close to it good market ,malls business center.About food is good but i like only indian food so no comment on it .Best i like is disco. one more thing like to tell you jetairways is number one air lines for me service is very good they are very co-oprative & helpfull I visit Dubai every 10 months for Business. This is my regular location and preference for stay. I choose this place as all my friends stay in close by areas and also the Hotel is very close to the Metro station ( AL KARAMA ). Staff: Service is very average and do not have any high expectations. The hotel has 3 Clubs which would go on till 3AM in the morning. If your room is on the First floor, then you might be disturbed due to the loud music from the Pubs. Rooms: The room is compact with balcony/ Mini bar/ LCD TV and safe locker. Bathroom includes a bathtub. Food & Drinks: Food is average and is quite expensive. If you wish to eat out, there are lot many restaurants within walkable distance from the hotel. Recreation: They do have a swimming pool, however would not recommend usage due to poor maintenance. Clubs/ Pubs: They have 3 Night Clubs which includes a Dance Bar/ Philippine club and an Indian pub. Evenings, the lobby and clubs will be crowded with hookers/ prostitutes. I would recommend this place if you are travelling alone or with friends and for those who are looking to enjoy some Night Life. The hotell is near a metro station, and there is also taxies standing outside the hotell all time. its werry cheap to take a taxi here. The rooms were big and clean. The people that worked at the hotell where friendly. The food from room service whar werry good. there were also a lot of resturants and shops close to the hotell. There where a several night clubs inside the hotell. And we quikely onderstood that these clubs are a litle bit ""gentelmens club"". The taxi drivers also told us that Karama hotell is a ""bad"" hotell... But... We didn`t see so mutch of it, and it was clean, friendly and cheap hotell thats worth the monney. Stayed in room 332, we were well looked after. The room service was excellent, the laundry services were good and the staff were courteous and friendly. We had a comfortable 5 night stay and would love to go back. Graet hotel for indian tourists, Staff are good and excellent , helpful eben if you do not tip them. But plesae tip them. Small rooms, Good breakfast. Nice experience. Stayed for three nights. Enjoyed the stay. location= good, just a 3-5 mins walk going to Al karama Station. Value= in terms of money? fair enough, cause what you can expect for USD30 courtesy=poor!!! staff doesn't even know how to greet hi and hellos to their customers. honesty of the staff= terrible! as what my review's title says... i don't recommend this 3-star hotel serving their customer as low as backpacker's room. if you guys think its cheapest then think twice! unless you want to lost your valuable things even inside your luggage bags inside the room your occupying. also, they're offering cheap tour packages, which will waste your time, city tour that not allows you to take pictures or closed timings on museums, entrance fees for which i know should be included to tour packages, reckless drivers, or in layman's term we've paid for tour package without tour guide!. NO wifi connections inside the room, be happy for a precious 1 free call from their landline! what's worse, the manager won't care either even if your reported it to them, i must say that the managers tolerating this kind of incidents from their staffs and these people doesn't know how to satisfy their customers. for my future visits in dubai, i might take other hotels which is bit higher in terms of room rate but deserves security and valuing customers satisfaction. I initially booked 10 days stay at this hotel but ended up staying only one night !!. The room was old style and dirty ! There are 2 clubs inside the Hotel ! the sound of the bass went on tell 4 am!! not possible to sleep. The breakfast was mainly Indian dishes and you can smell the cooking all over the places. Internet was not free and slow ! The management accepted to cancel my stay after only one night and even offered a free cap to my new hotel !! It could be a very nice place if it was managed properly. Though the location of this hotel is good, there is nothing great about the service and rooms and other facilities here. There are many dance bars and hence makes it difficult for families to stay in the hotel. Housekeeping was bad too and the rooms weren't cleaned every day.",,,
Carlystar,237579,"Good hotel in down town Vancouver. The room we stayed in was a 2 bedroom with lounge area and kitchen which included a coffee machine. The room was very clean and the hotel had a bar down stairs with breakfast and drinks till late, which provided free wifi for use. The bed was a bit hard for my liking. The hotel was in a great location to go to the Canucks game as the stadium was within walking distance. It was also close to Granville st and shops along robson avenue but not right in the middle to get the noise.. I loved this place. From the time we arrived in a airport shuttle to the time we left we had everything we could ask for at our finger tips. We arrived to be greeted at reception with a cocktail and wonderful service. They had everything ready for us including maps and an information pack for the area. We were shown to our room and it was great. It had a huge lounge room, dining room and kitchen were we could cook and the bathroom and master bedroom were spacious and we have a TV in the lounge and also in the bedroom. It was like being back at home. I really enjoyed having a bit of space to move about after being in tiny hotel rooms. It was so close to the main strip of Hollywood and the Chinese theatre. There were plenty of restaurants that we could choose from all of our tours picked up along the strip and there was a supermarket around the corner so we could use the kitchen. I loved the DVD menu we could use and the complimentary snack menu we could choose from at any time. If I returned to LA I would stay here without a doubt!. From arriving at the hotel with the concierge being right on the footpath to help with my bags to leaving 3 days later this hotel exceeded my expectations. We arrived early however our room was ready and check in was speedy and efficient. The room was large and spacious. It was nice after travelling for 6 weeks to have a lounge room and separate bedroom to spread out and enjoy our stay. It was immaculately clean. The bathroom was huge with the shower separate to the bath and a huge mirror. I really enjoyed the Nespresso machine and free wifi that they provided. They had a business centre and I thought the library was a nice touch for guests. Location was great within 15 min walk from everything we wanted to see or to the pier to catch the ferry to grouse mountain. The lobby of the hotel is amazing. It was a great first impression to the hotel as we walked in and the lady at reception checked our group in to our rooms quickly and efficiently. Our room however was very old and dated. The shower head was horrible and the jet made the water come out very hard. I don't like the fact that the room has no fridge but being a casino I can understand they want you down in the playing area at all times instead of being in the room. The bed was amazing. It was a king size and perfect for sleeping just the right mixture of softness and support. We had a room with 2 queen size beds in it and there was still room to move around including a desk, chair and small table so the rooms are huge. Even as I type this the hotel is under renovation so if you are going to book this hotel I would strongly recommend that you pay a bit extra and book the new rooms. They had an example set up in the lobby and it looked amazing. Overall great location at the end of the strip, has everything you need to gamble and go out and the lions are cute... but needs major work to compete with the newer hotels on the strip which they are undertaking. One small disappointment was at the end of my stay I left my jacket in the cupboard. When contacted the hotel was willing to post the jacket to me at a cost of $136USD. I thought this was a bit expensive considering I was a group of 10 and we had spent a large sum of money in the hotel and gaming areas. So this has left a bad taste to the hotel We were coming to the end of our trip and it was nice to be welcomed by the lovely staff at the Inn. The hotel was in a great spot for pike markets and was a close walk to the centre of town with all the shopping. All the staff were fantastic. We didnÃ¢â¬â¢t realise that most tourist activities didnÃ¢â¬â¢t run in winter however Katie went out of her way to help us try and find a tour to the boeing factory for my partner who really wanted to go there. We were fortunate to be able to change our rooms after the first night to a water view room and the view was stunning. It was so nice to watch the sun set over the water. Huge Bathroom which was very clean. The one small down side was the area of the hotel and not with the hotel itself which I have marked down the location below. As tourists we walked everywhere, returning home from town at night was a little bit daunting sometimes as there were quite a few people that hang around pike and pine street in groups. Sometimes I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t feel 100% safe and had to catch cabs however everything is super closed so cabs were ver cheap. The lobby of the hotel is amazing. It was a great first impression to the hotel as we walked in and the lady at reception checked our group in to our rooms quickly and efficiently. Our room however was very old and dated. The shower head was horrible and the jet made the water come out very hard.

I thought this was a bit expensive considering I was a group of 10 and we had spent a large sum of money in the hotel and gaming areas. So this has left a bad taste to the hotel We stayed here as part of a 2 month tour of Europe. The hotel is quite old and expensive for what you get compared to other hostels we stayed at in Europe. We were on the top floor and the stairs were steep with small steps not the most pleasant time trying to carry all your suitcases up there. We had a 3 person private room and bathroom. The bathroom was good size however the room was old and had a huge whole in the wall that had my friend stuffing her towel in so no bugs could come out. There was a beam in the room which caused issues when sitting up in bed. The location was OK. Close to the Heineken factory and walking distance to all the things you needed. The bus stop was across the road with cafes around the corner. Reception were OK, not overly friendly but answered our questions when we needed.","Stayed here on a university trip to Amsterdam and our expectations were not high at all, however we were all pleasently surprised when we arrived, staff were all very friendly! Stayed on the 3rd floor, stairs are a nightmare, ridiculously steep and no lift, you get a key card to let you into the room, Room was spacious, 3 single beds, bright, clean, towels provided, and unsuite was very clean. There was a few problems with the pressure and temperature of the shower but we got our hair washed none the less. Breakfast is served in the morning, very basic, cereal, rice cakes, toast, and coffee, tea, and apple juice, but this did the job! Tram line right outside, close to centre! If your not fussed on luxery its perfect! Stayed here for three days in march 2012, paid quite a bit for this hostel due to the fact that I needed somewhere decent to stay, biggest mistake of my trip, not only did we pay upfront for the room we were told on arrival that there was no smoking however we smoked in the room and were forced to pay a 100 euro fine plus when we handed in our room keys they refused to refund the 20 euro for these stating that this would also contribute to us smoking in the room, fair enough we broke the rules but 120 euro when absolutely nothing was destroyed?? extortionate!! to add insult to injury we left the hostel for one day and returned to stay in a more expensive private room WHICH WE HAD ALREADY PAID FOR but were informed by staff that we had to pay a FURTHER 100 EURO if we wanted to stay in this hostel, refused and asked for a refund but this was not an option as apparently we were canceling the room, we were being forced to cancel due to the fact we did not have the money to pay and we were refused a refund for canceling. ABSOLUTE JOKE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOSTEL TO ANYONE WHO WANTS SOMEWHERE NICE TO STAY! I visited this hotel with my girlfriend on an organised trip. We were initially sceptical because of the mixed reviews on here. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is basic, but the rooms, en suite and communal areas were very clean. The rooms we stayed in contained three single beds, which were comfortable and fresh towels were in the cupboard (no additional cost as previously stated). The breakfast was basic and self service - a choice of cereals, toast, rice crackers, fresh tea/coffee and fruit juices. Internet was available in the reception area, but wifi was free throughout the hotel (again, not just on the ground floor as previously stated). Rooms were accessible using swipe cards, which also controlled access to the hotel entrance. We did not experience any excessive noise problems from other guests. Close to supermarket and tram lines, very central location. Vending machine in lobby sells tins of beer for E1,5 or softdrinks. Overall very satisfied with our stay and would reccommend to friends. Nothing fancy, but a good base. + Bedroom was very clean, with a big sink area and mirror which was handy + Wifi a big plus + Good location and easy to find (right by the Heineken brewery). Could walk to museumplein, red light district, etc. (would recommend a tram for the train station though!) + Hostel seemed quite secure and wasn't too loud - Rooms were tiny, when sharing with people you don't know it seemed to really lack personal space. - Seemed like we paid hotel prices for a bog standard hostel. We did book late, so just try to book early and you'll get something in Amsterdam that's much better for the same price. (We were paying 25 each per night) -Not enough showers! One per floor?! Waited 30 mins one morning, annoying when you want to just get out and explore. So if you've made a booking here don't worry, you'll enjoy Amsterdam and there's nothing terrible about the hostel, if you're looking to book now I'd recommend shopping around online, I've stayed in several better places in Amsterdam We stayed here as part of a 2 month tour of Europe. The hotel is quite old and expensive for what you get compared to other hostels we stayed at in Europe.

The bus stop was across the road with cafes around the corner. Reception were OK, not overly friendly but answered our questions when we needed. The location was good, getting in from a long flight IN THE MORNING and also very tired to be greeted rudely by front desk person who actually had us waiting in the lounge for an hour.. . The lounge was also gloomy and dirty with dirty dishes on the tables. The room is very small and the beds are very uncomfortable. My comforter had blood stains all over and there was a awful smell coming from the bathroom. I will advise travellers do not stay at this hotel you will be very disappointed with the way you are treated by the guy who works the morning shift and atmosphere of the hotel.",,,
Gary M,182539,"I recently stayed in this hotel in February 2012. The rooms were clean, service was excellent, and the staff was helpful and courteous. I enjoyed the decor and feel of being at the harbor. Restaurants at the hotel and in the area were goos, and Harbor Island was a great place to wander and relax. My wife and 2 teenage sons stayed at this location for 2 nights in March '12. Having stayed at many Sheraton's all over NA I was unsure what the service level would be like in a tourist location being next door to a theme park. We were literally pampered at every level of contact within the property. Breakfast staff were attentive and cheerful. Evening drinks in the lounge (just mom and dad of course) was terrific and the staff again was very social and fun. Business center was state of the art and even the hotel wifi worked well. The rooms were clean, beds very comfortable, and I loved the shower head so much I am changing mine at home. A special shout out to one of the front desk managers, Sam. She took great care of us and made us feel like we were more important than anyone else. I found it impressive because in a property that boasts high turnover day to day it takes a dedicated team member to make people feel that way in such a short time frame. Thank you Sam and we are already talking about when our next trip there will be. Regardless of whether we visit universal we will stay at this Sheraton. Regards, Gary, Shelley, Justin & Jordan. Pros: Good location near Barajas airport. Free shuttle bus. Swimming pool. Cons: The swimming pool is not open all day. The sun loungers are horrendously shaped and not at all comfortable. There are no towel facilities for the pool. The cafeteria inside and by the pool were rarely staffed and we found it very difficult to even get a cup of coffee let alone, a a cold drink. Nice room, great staff, free shuttle to all Disney venues and Seaworld. Golfing nearby, wide array of restaurants nearby. Heated pool was great. There is no restaurant, just the poolside snackshop (burgers and such). No worrys about safety/security, nice section of town. Near the trolley line. Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights in February Ã¢â¬â¢11. Based in a posh and expensive looking part of Paris very close to the Champs Elysees and about a 15-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. Even though it is in quite a posh location you didnÃ¢â¬â¢t feel out of place. It is a very clean hotel. The reception staff are pleasant and all spoke English. The hotel seems to have a nice laid-back atmosphere. The breakfast room is tiny as other reviews report, 16 tables in 4 blocks of 4 but we didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have a problem. The breakfast choice is croissant, cereal, yogurt, fruit and juice. The coffee wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t so great, slightly burnt taste but nothing to complain about. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

Restaurants at the hotel and in the area were goos, and Harbor Island was a great place to wander and relax. Pros: Excellent value for money. Plentiful seating areas, spacious and clean. Shops and Tapas bar inside the hotel, very convenient. Nice pool area. Free airport shuttle. Cons: Pool are did not open until 1pm. This is really absurd! Why have a nice pool and sun loungers if one can cannot use them first thing in the morning through to evening? Remote from the strip. $21 for a simple breakfast. $20 per day resort fee and the pool was closed. $6 per beer. No fridge or microwave. All male bartenders. No movie channels. Try to force 'On Demand'. Other than being monetarily assaulted, room was great, clean, extravagant bed. Staff was nice. Felt safe, parking was easy. Nice array of encased RockyRoll memorabilia.

Now that's a deal! Service was great. Staff was friendly. Good area. Very clean place. Will come back next time I'm in beautiful Vancouver city. Cheers! Nice room, great staff, free shuttle to all Disney venues and Seaworld. Golfing nearby, wide array of restaurants nearby. Heated pool was great. There is no restaurant, just the poolside snackshop (burgers and such). No worrys about safety/security, nice section of town. Near the trolley line. Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights in February â11. Based in a posh and expensive looking part of Paris very close to the Champs Elysees and about a 15-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. Even though it is in quite a posh location you didnât feel out of place. It is a very clean hotel. The reception staff are pleasant and all spoke English. The hotel seems to have a nice laid-back atmosphere. The breakfast room is tiny as other reviews report, 16 tables in 4 blocks of 4 but we didnât have a problem. The breakfast choice is croissant, cereal, yogurt, fruit and juice. The coffee wasnât so great, slightly burnt taste but nothing to complain about. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. 2nd time I have stayed here on business, hotel chosen for location (good) and price (very good compared to some nearby). Rooms are small - indeed tiny if you choose a single room or if you are unlucky. I left feedback with the hotel last time I stayed and am dissapointed to see that the same issues remain. 1 - the TVs in the rooms are at 90 degrees to the head of the bed so you either need to watch with your head propped at 90 degrees and end up with a very sore neck or you have to rearrange such that you sleep at the foot of the bed. Why can't they just put the TV on a wall or where it can be seen? 2 - the free WiFi wasn't working at all. This is pretty essential when on a business trip so I was pretty hacked off. This wasn't mentioned when I checked in as I may have considered not staying. It was the same last time too, so don't be fooled by the ""free WiFi"" stated on their website. This wasn't even available in the public areas. 3 - there is no heating in the bathrooms, nothing, zilch..... accordingly the bathrooms are freezing. I had to leave the door open all night to allow some warmth from the room to go into the bathroom. This doubled the noise from the traffic outside. 4 - is the noise which I appreciate isn't the fault of the hotel. If you are a light sleeper I recommend that you ask for a room away from the main road at Euston Sq station side. The noise was deafening from cars and ambulance siren all night long. On the plus side, the hotel is clean and the staff are very nice. Breakfast was good, and despite my niggles is does represent good value if you accept that you get what you pay for.

Remote from the strip. $21 for a simple breakfast. $20 per day resort fee and the pool was closed. $6 per beer. No fridge or microwave. All male bartenders. No movie channels. Try to force 'On Demand'. Other than being monetarily assaulted, room was great, clean, extravagant bed. Staff was nice. Felt safe, parking was easy. Nice array of encased RockyRoll memorabilia.","I stayed at this property last weekend and have never stayed at the Ramada brand before but thought I would give it a chance because for around $80 you get a nice clean room, with free breakfast, free wifi and free parking. Now that's a deal! Service was great. Staff was friendly. Good area. Very clean place. Will come back next time I'm in beautiful Vancouver city. Cheers! Ramada Metrotown is 5 minutes from BCIT - quiet location, nicely decorated rooms, GREAT shower massage and comfy beds. Great rates (weekly available) for intensive studies at BCIT or working downtown. Free parking and great coffee. Couldn't ask for a better combination! I stayed over the Grey cup weekend. At first I thought the location might be too far from the game however I was pleasantly surprised at how convenient it was given that the sky train was a short ten minute walk to station. What a great way to see the city. We got upgraded to a suite and the rooms looked immaculate. We were thrilled with what we got for the price we paid. We will definitely come back on our next trip hopefully for the playoffs. We booked a 2 bed room suite here & it was great - by mistake I have reviewed Downtown Ramada too - sorry - we didn't stay there! This hotel is great to site see Vancouver from - Vancouver a bit disappointing - run down in parts - lots of homeless. However Vancouver Aquarium fantastic - great shows, Stanley Park beautiful esp nice restaurant there. Go whale watching if you get the chance too Pool 10 feet deep at one end - my little boy as we are is a strong swimmer but it was a bit deep - take care with that - however a lovely stay - recommend. This is a perfect hotel in the heart of Vancouver for exploring the city - we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite - great facilities - pool fun but very deep at the one end - 10 foot! Even though our little boy is an excellent swimmer, as we are, we were a little uneasy with the depth of the pool. However a great stay with everything you needed. Vancouver City disappointing - backdrop gorgeous, Stanley Park gorgeous & a couple of streets pretty but overall a bit run down - a lot of homeless people - not what we expected. Interesting to see though - go whale watching if you get the chance - overall a great stay. Also eat at the very nice restaurant in Stanley Park - beautiful food. No frills but a clean quiet place to stay. This hotel is located in a Korean neighborhood so most of the food is Korean but pizza by the slice is available at some local shops. The Safeway is across the parking lot so you can get some food to keep in the mini-fridge. Coffee maker provided but no cups. Staff was ok, not the friendliest but not rude. If you have extra people be prepared to pay extra at the desk, even if the site you booked on did not allow you to select # of guests. 15 minute walk to the train station, good value. I would stay here again for the price. The attached restaurant is never open it seems. Food does not look that great. i stayed here for 2 nights over the long weekend and was pleasantly surprised with rooms and service. The hotel was the best deal in the area compared to what was close by.There is a nice outdoor pool with lots of seating area so you can swim or read a book while sitting in the sun. There is a sports bar in hotel so if you want to watch a game or get something to eat it's very convenient. A good deal for what you pay! Pros: Lots of (mostly Chinese) restaurants nearby, grocery (Safeway) store across street, free parking, free wifi, 15-minute walk from Skytrain station, non-smoking rooms. Cons: Very thin walls, peeling paint on bathroom ceiling, preset thermostat you cannot control (very annoying), basic bedding and towels. Generally clean and decent for what I paid for 3 nights. Front desk staff pleasant. Not being able to adjust the room temperature was strange. The front desk said it is preset and not adjustable. I had a single room with queen. The positive first: The staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel is reasonably cheap. The biggest plus is the really fast WiFi. Most other upscale places I stayed for business have a painfully slow connection. Not this place. Also, this hotel has nice tick walls. I was right on top of the bar they have on the ground floor and the hallways were quite loud. However, as soon as I closed the room door it was quiet. As many other have stated, this hotel has seen its days. The room bed and bath are clean, but somewhat run down. The wall paper is has loose edges, the grout in the bath has been painted and the paint is coming off and the day cover for the bed had a burn hole in it (so much for no smoking room). The hotel is right next to a large and Safeway grocery store and a liquor store and the room has a decent size fridge, so I was covered there. Other than that, there are tons of Asian restaurants around and 2 Starbucks within walking distance. We booked a 2 room suite with a kitchenette. Room was very clean. Beds were very comfortable! Kids loved it, had there own TV!. And free wireless internet. Free parking was a bonus. Hotel has a restaurant, we all enjoyed our daily breakfast, tastefully prepared by Narinder. There are lots of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. Easy access to Children's Hospital, as our visit was for appointments there. We have booked a cruise to Alaska in July 2011, and plan to stay in Vancouver on our return, and have already booked our rooms with Ramada Metrotown. My husband and I spent a weekend here recently. We travel to Vancouver once or twice a year and will likely make this our choice in future. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and we appreciated the good lighting in the room. Other pluses were a fridge, coffee maker, ironing board, and hairdryer. Parking is free. Good value for the price. On this visit (our first) the front desk called us in the evening to inform us that the parking lot security man had noticed some small items (not of great value) on the floor of our car and recommended that we remove them from sight to prevent a break-in. We certainly appreciated this. We stayed here the night before our cruise left from the Vancouver port. The rates for the hotels downtown were a lot higher so we opted for this location based on TripAdvisor reviews - $99 for the night. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Skytrain through a mostly residential neighborhood. (Note: I think the hotel has a shuttle to the Skytrain - call for info.) The hotel itself is in a neighborhood with lots of dining choices - there's a Papa John's and Subway down the street, a Safeway right across the street, and lots of Asian restaurants in the area. The room had 2 double beds, TV, wireless internet, fridge, phone, coffeemaker, and nice toiletries. The room looked like it had been newly remodeled, but the hallway and elevators could probably use a freshening up. There's no free breakfast, but there is a restaurant just off the lobby. Oddly, there was a power outage during our stay. One lady was stuck in the elevator, but they got her out quickly. Power was out for about two hours in the area - not the hotel's fault. Staff were very nice during the whole visit. I have nothing to gain or lose from this review and have no ties whatsoever to this hotel ! Hubby and I stayed for two nights during a weekend trip to beautiful Vancouver. The hotel is easily reached from YVR airport by Canada Line - transfer @ City Center to Sky Train/Expo Line >> King George and get off @ Joyce Street exit. From here it's about a 7 min walk. Hotel is unpretentious, somewhat dated and set in a basically Asian neighborhood. Room was clean, basic but comfy. People were very friendly and helpful. We did not feel unsafe at all - even at night - while roaming the neighborhood for places to eat. Metrotown Mall is a 15 min walk or next SkyTrain station. Excellent place to just spend comfy nights while roaming the City at daytime and will definitely return to this value-for-money location ! My business meetings were at Glelyon Parkway and also at a co. located in/nearDiscovery park. This hotel location was ideal. Close to both meeting places. Rooms were veery clean. Very helpfull staff. The heater in my room started blowing cold air, in the middle of the night. I called the desk, and a young fellow came up right away, and fix the problem. Next morning the front desk staff and the housekeeping staff asked me if I was comfortable after the heat problem! Hotel has a business, came in handy when I had to prepare for my presentation. Laptops can do only so much. Good food and good service in the Jaguar's Bar and Restaurant.",,,
BIGT60,310451,"What ever you do, do not get room #106. This room has some machinery behinfd it which makes a really loud sound every 20, 30 or 40 minutes. You won't be able to sleep. The sound is like an air conditioner compressor re-starting. Even my fiance which is a sound sleeper complained about the noise. The pillows are not good. One is long the other one is a big square one??? We've stayed in this hotel many times and is nice just try to get your rooms past the David Cookies... Where to start? Room, nice with 2 beds, clean the problem the a/c when it cooled it made a noise like an old propeller plane you could not sleep (room #231). The bar and restaurant looke old and no a/c. The employees seem lofe-less, there's no service except for a young man called William, hwe would go out of his way to make things happen. Also arrived one afternoon to the pool from Caracoles, they told me that I could not have my cooler around the pool. There's no bar around the pool, and when I asked to get a dringk in the pool they told me that they don't have this kind of service. You can't enter the bar from the pool because there's a sign that says: ""No one allowed in bathing suit in ths area"" So you can't go to the bar to get a drink from the pool either. Last time I was there was around 10 years ago, it has not evolved with the times....","This hotel is not at all a 3 star experience. Maybe a minus 1 star would be more appropriate. Rude help, unreasonable prices, dirty room, and generally this place offers a poor experience. I'm surprised that they didn't charge my wife and I for air and through it all, they behave like they have the corner on the nice hotel market. If you don't like paying too much, being treated poorly, and being made to feel like you came from another planet because you don't speak Spanish, you won't like this place. Particulars you ask...Air Conditioner made the room sound like an airplane taking off, nice linens are a foreign concept to this place, food is expensive and awful, but above all the staff is very rude when you bring up any problems to them. I am not a complainer, but I am angry with this place. I have been in 72 countries, I speak two languages other than English, and I have been around the world at least 10 times. Because of my experience, I feel that I can honestly say that this hotel is a dump and you should spend your money elsewhere. I recently spent 5 nights with my wife and 3 year old daughter. We were always greeted by sincere friendliness by everyone. Service could not be better. Amenities were well above expectations. Luckily my wife's family lives nearby, so I am looking forward to staying there again and again. What ever you do, do not get room #106.

We've stayed in this hotel many times and is nice just try to get your rooms past the David Cookies... this is a great resort - very clean, great pool area, and a very nice beach. We stayed there almost an entire week (We first rented a house in Guayama, which turned out to be horrible, and moved to the Windham after suffering there for 2 days) During the week, not a lot of people, so we had the pool area and the beach almost entirely to ourselves. the staff is VERY friendly, and helpful. there were a few minor issues, but as the staff resolved everything ASAP, they're not even worth mentioning. If we come back to PR for another vacation, we most likely will stay there again! The Sheraton over booked the hotel we were scheduled to stay at, but made arrangements for us to stay here at the Wyndham. It was about an hour taxi ride from the Sheraton PR Convention Center. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (Mayerling). The room was average, but the pool area, grounds, and beach, which was a short 3 minute walk, were all beautiful. We ate at the restaurant, service was slow, the food was pricey, but the meals were very good. I would stay here again, a rental car would be a good idea. Just returned from a 5 night trip to the Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar. This was our third trip back to Palmas del Mar and each year, the hotel management and staff make us feel at home. Palmas del Mar is a hidden vacation spot with a relaxed atmosphere and what makes this hotel so special is the staff. Flavia - you and your team at the Wyndham Garden are AWESOME. Just came back from a wonderful stay at the Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar. The staff was wonderful, the hotel immaculate, the pool was spectacular. Two negatives were the pillows had a funky oder and the food in the restaraunt left much to be desired for the price. They have minimal handicap accessibility, although they said they are currently out for bids for elevators. The beach is a very short walk and it's gorgeous...heavy rip tides though. I can't begin to describe the hospitallity of the front desk staff!! They were amazing!!! I even made $112 in the casino at a penny slot machine (paid for dinner) :-) I had my twin 17 year old nieces with me and didn't give a second thought to them walking anywhere on the grounds at any time of day or night. Good, safe, family oriented hotel. We'd go back in a heartbeat!! Thank you so much, Maya! From January 9-11, I visited the hotel. Check-in was efficient, and we settled in to our room. The air conditioner was absolutely frigid, and they had to make a service call. The room had high speed but no wifi. It appeared newly renovated, and the amenities (coffee, towels, etc.) were of good quality. The pool was a little cold, but the hot tub was fine. There is a private beach, but the surf is very rough. Only very strong swimmers should even attempt to go in the ocean. We had dinner at the nearby plaza, which has several restaurants and a nice town square feel. All in all, a wonderful stay! We stayed at Wyndham Garden from January 2 - 6th, 2012 and had a very pleasant stay. The front desk was always very happy to assist and we were greeted warmly by all staff we would pass by. The room was very nice but needs to be upgraded (old TV, no dresser for makeup....). The amenities are nice, Trueblue spa! We had a leak problem in the room and they quickly came to resolve the issue. The grounds are beautiful and very relaxing. The pool is nice, but we did not go in, was cold and seemed to not be heated. The beach by the hotel is not for swimming at all, and the surf was rough while we were there so we travelled elsewhere for beach fun. The negative things I found were that you have to pay for parking (you need a car to get to Humacao and travel around....nothing in the area in terms of activities), no elevator so you have to either bring up the luggage yourself or use bellhop service, no ice machine in the building we were staying at, and the food is way overpriced for the value. My boyfriend and I had a couple of drinks, a sandwich, and an order of wings for lunch at the pool bar and it came out to $68 dollars, which is ridiculous and the food was only average...My suggestion, eat elsewhere. Overall the customer service and scenery are the +++ for this hotel. They are also in process of renovation so things will most likely improve. My wife and I stayed here for only 2 nights, first time at Palmas Del Mar, Puerto Rico, but our experience here seems like we have been there numerous times. We had what i would call a ""WOW"" experience, this is the very 1st WOW I have given to hotels I have stayed in throughout the world, I travel to SE Asia, Europe, Mexico and other places. This is the reason why it is wow- Before coming to Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar, we were staying at the Marriott Condado Beach, San Juan for 4 nights, we were surprised to find a bottle of wine, fruit and snacks waiting for us, I thought maybe it came from the Marriott management for being Elite members, but when I read the card, it was from Limarie Moral, ByRequest Coordinator of Wyndham Garden, the note read that they were very excited and looking forward to our stay at their hotel, no hotel has ever done this before, to take the time to find out what room we were in and doing a little research of who we are and so forth. In addition, Flavia Bonilla, Guest Service Manager at Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar Hotel & Casino, saw us in the lobby and introduced herself, she knew who we were and something I have not experienced in many hotels ever. So kudos to Wyndham Garden, rest assured we will come back and stay there again, most likely for more days, extremely highly recommended!",,,
Robert O,309659,"We were looking for a hotel to stay for a couple of days prior to take a cruise. We were looking for a hotel in the Old San Juan area as this was the part of Puerto Rico we were most interested in. We also wanted to stay close to the cruise pier. (Be aware that if you are taking a Royal Carribean cruise, the pier close to this hotel is not used by this cruise line to start a cruise) Location was great, Staff efficient and friendly and room was large and always clean. I saw some travelers rate this hotel poorly in the area of cleanliness and hotel upkeep and almost did not book because of those reviews. I am not sure what they are looking at because we had not issues for the 2.5 days were were there. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend you give it a try! Its a nice and clean hotel. Forget about the clubs, the rooftop bar where you can sit outside is relaxing with nice view over the port, with friendly staff. I was not impressed by the food, and the breakfast was bad with very limited choice (not even cheese for example). But i had a nice stay, money/quality value is good. Picked this hotel mostly due to points I accumulated during a long term stay with another Club Carlson hotel. We booked online and used some of our points in conjunction with cash. I wasn't sure what to expect since we did this a bit on the cheap. I requested the advertised upgrade, upon availability. When my wife and I arrived it was pretty much first class from then on. Quick courteous check-in and personalized service on eating/shows/directions. Not just a check-in clerk, they had a small staff at the desk. They gave us an upgrade to a suite on the top floor, complimentary bottle of wine, and personal thank you message. Though we were only staying for the night they treated us as though we would be long term guests paying top dollar. Can't say everyone gets this treatment, but everyone I saw that checked in while I was there did. We will stay at this hotel on future visits. Good central location; parking was better on backside of hotel. The suite was spacious and the bed was very comfortable (sleep number). I'm a military retiree, and an unexpected pleasure was the hallway on the lower level (by the pool, fitness room, and restaurant) which displayed pictures and memorabilia from military members from all branches of service from across the ages - very nice.","Its a nice and clean hotel.

I was not impressed by the food, and the breakfast was bad with very limited choice (not even cheese for example). But i had a nice stay, money/quality value is good. I visited this hotel in August and they had renovations done so it was not a nice experience, the pool water was drained & could not swim. I am sure it would have been a nice experienc eif it was not for the renovations. They served nice breakfast and had friendly and helpful staff. this hotel is far and not centrally located, very close to the harbor. It is a hotel right opposite port, it is clean, has all what you need. You will have to pay 50 dirhams to get i the nightclub(gives you 1 free drink), and there are many ladies of pleasure, if you do not like this, than just do not go this nightclub, although if you make it clear that you want to be left alone, they all do. The band is one of the bet around. Nice clean hotel and relatively cheap for Dubai yes it is cheap. and is not dirty. but that is it. the nightclubs attract a crowd that is not really ""top class"" and hotel itself is quite dark and basic. the breakfast also is just basic (unless you are indian). there is absolutelly no seaview. the hotel location was very good with 2 nightclubs good entrance nice room and good atmosphere hello everyone,its a nice hotel,superb complimentary breakfast,swimming pool at top with a good view of sea on one side and burj khalifa on the other.the rooms r bit small in size but acceptable.u can reach all the places in dubai without wasting time.i can advise to choose this hotel.night can be enjoyed in the hotel. I stayed at this hotel a number of times in the past few years and to be very honest, it is clean, the food is fine and the rooms are of a good standard. The hotel is handy for local shops but to get to the main shopping areas its a taxi ride away but even then they are not going to break the bank! You get what you pay for-its not a named Dubai 5 star hotel so you dont pay their prices or get the same facilities however its excellent value for money and I have no hesitation in saying book it. There is a night club and speciality restaurants and like any hotel in Dubai, if you are a male on your own the chances are someone might try and pick you up, but like looking in a shop window, dont buy if you dont want to! One tip I would make, is that at the busy exhibition times and rush hour, taxis are hard to come by (like most places in Dubai),so book in advance or take the hotel car! I found the staff helpful and remember, behaviour breeds behaviour Quite unhappy with the hotel. We were already staying in Dubai in another hotel close to the city center, and moved in here as our friends had booking in this hotel. Firstly, we were given a room which was said to be non-smoking, but I just couldnt enter the room due to such a bad stench of smoke and smell from the room. Without entering the room, I requested for a change and was refused due to non-availability. Right in front of me, another new guest came without a reservation, and he was given a room. So I was furious at the service. We got an extra bed in our friends room and had to stay there. Breakfast was ordinary. Not many options. The orange juice was diluted with was to an extent that it just looked like orange water, with hardly any flavor. Luckily we were in this hotel for just a night. I would strongly recommend you to look at better options. Hotel is fair value for money, but it's not in a central location, so be prepared for plenty of taxi rides (which are cheap relative to UK). Staff are friendly, except for reception, which I found bordering on the sullen. Biggest gripe was the noise from the hotel nightclub, open until 3am every morning. Because of this, I had to change my room at 1.30am from one overlooking the port to one overlooking a building site. Manager compensated me for this by deducting the cost of a meal costing all of Â£7.50! On checking out, I again had problems with reception, being charged for phone calls I didn't make and meals I didn't have. With so many hotels on offer, there must be better ones for the money than this. Stayed in this hotel in october for 4 nights, room was spacious with a view on the arabic gulf and cleaned every day, complimentary newspaper is provided also everyday. It's trus that it's a bit difficult to sleep at night because of the 3 night clubs but overall, hotel was good and in good location in bur dubai. i found this hotel to be overpriced for the facilities and comfort it offers, except being in Bur Dubai and convenient to reach from the trade center, i dont see any specific reason to be here. the rooms are small and congested and old fashion design. breakfast is very uninteresting ..overall the whole property is very uninteresting and purely average. not worth the price really. I travelled to Dubai on 24th April 2010 for 7 nights and stayed at the Sea View Hotel. We were warmly greeted by the lovely reception and were impressed by the friendly welcoming staff. We soon checked into our room and I wasn't highly impressed. The rooms were very basic and instead of the 'sea view' we were promised, the view outside our window was a huge grey old building under construction work and a half grown garden. This was extremely disappointing. The hotel was very clean, the bed covers and toilets were cleaned everyday despite not having put out the 'please clean my room' sign. Room service was generally good, although speaking to the hotel staff via telephone could be difficult on the odd occassion as 1.- No one would answer your call and 2.- You would have to repeat yourself 2 or 3 times to get what you want. I didn't particulary like the location of the hotel however, they ran free shutter buses that dropped and picked you up to and from Jumeriah beach. The only down point about that was the timing! It was from 10.30am- 2.30pm. This was not enough time to spend at the beach! The breakfast was lovely! They had a variety of food and lots of prefences to chose from! On a down point, I was spoken to very rudely by an arab gentleman telling me I was late for breakfast (at 10am) where as infact breakfast closed at 10:30am! I Then only to find out that he was the owner of the hotel!- extremely rude! I agree with all the comments regarding the noise from nightclubs and how expensive the hotel taxi is! It is cheaper to get a normal taxi. I would recommend this hotel for people who intend to stay for a couple of days- mainly for business use (although the noise from the nightclub would contradict this). Would not recommend this hotel for a romantic stay/ family holiday (who have small children). We were just glad we spent most of the day out and only came back to sleep. I am lucky that got a room at 5th floor. There's a noisy night club in the hotel. If you want a silent night, bring your ear-plugs. However, in case you want to have fun, the club is really hot! Good location, fair price, good service. Travel desk people is ready to help you arranging organized tours! Only one negative experience - loud music from the nightclub made us sleepless. And the minibar was never refilled. Good hotel helpful staff reasonably priced. Very early morning can get waken by neighboring building work you will need a taxi to any shopping center or beach. Very small pool. Make sure go to Irish village good food and crack",,,
mikkol,228377,"I had a 3 night stay in this hotel during Christmas, which it has a buy-2-get-1-free promotion. At 50 euros a night, I don't expect something spectacular but it was quite wonderful anyway. It's a block from the famous Kadewe shopping center with loads of cafes along its street. It's 1/2 block away from the closest metro station Augsburger Strasse. Note that such station does not have escalator / elevators (as many metro stations don't). From airport you may take a bus to zoologischer garten station, where you can take a metro change to there (which requires line change for that 2 stations distance and ups/downs of stairs during the change) or walk from there to hotel that needs about 10-15min. I guess they upgraded our room so it was quite big with a balcony (kinda useless in winter) where we can see the quiet street and its neighbourhood. The rooms + beds are basic (the professional photos would've fooled you) but clean and comfy. Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful responding inquiries in perfect English. There's also a gym + spa + sauna facility upstairs at 6th floor. One small complaint would be the free WIFI. Though free, it needs a unique user/password pair per day per device - kind of annoying, and the service gets cut off easily when I reached my room. Overall this hotel is still a great place for tourist to stay. I stayed here during the New Year's eve time. Hotel Magenta by itself is quite alright. Whole hotel was filled WIFI hotspots. Service was professional in English. At night the door was locked unless you ring the bell to make sure you were a tourist-like figure. I would say the purple / magenta color theme hid its aged building rather well, though personally I would prefer brighter, whiter hotels so the carpets won't look the same no matter it's washed or not. My room had a double bed with adequate size (not big in any sense but okay). It had a large window facing interior squares facing other apartments which were quite comfortable and quiet. The noises were mainly from the other travelers who returned late or left early, but it was still manageable. The problem I see are similar to what Paul_Glynis below mentioned: the location. While it was conveniently located *near* 2 RER train stations. You can see clearly that areas near train stations aren't the best place to stay for more than 1 nights in Paris. The fact for this hotel is, we would still need to take 1 subway change to arrive our hotel (or you may walk for 10-15min if you are luggage free). What that means to a traveler with luggage is that, there's not much point to stay near the train station but not close to it because we still had to carry the heavy luggage to travel through those stupid stairs in subway tunnels and exits. On our way leaving Paris we simply took buses transferring to Opera to take the airport bus because we were just so tired to take the luggage with us via subways - which weren't too safe esp in RER train stations. If you have the 120+ euros to stay here and prefer some conveniences to / from airports, this is NOT your choice. I stayed here during the New Year's eve time. Hotel Magenta by itself is quite alright. Whole hotel was filled WIFI hotspots. Service was professional in English. At night the door was locked unless you ring the bell to make sure you were a tourist-like figure. I would say the purple / magenta color theme hid its aged building rather well, though personally I would prefer brighter, whiter hotels so the carpets won't look the same no matter it's washed or not. My room had a double bed with adequate size (not big in any sense but okay). It had a large window facing interior squares facing other apartments which were quite comfortable and quiet. The noises were mainly from the other travelers who returned late or left early, but it was still manageable. The problem I see are similar to what Paul_Glynis below mentioned: the location. While it was conveniently located *near* 2 RER train stations. You can see clearly that areas near train stations aren't the best place to stay for more than 1 nights in Paris.

Rooms were huge, bathroom was also very big. It was clean everywhere. And no noise during the nights. Breakfast was good. Staff was very helpful and polite. Free WLAN was available. Also it was possible to print e-tickets for the flight. Neighborhood was very nice and peaceful. Tube was close. And very good shopping street was also very near. We took a taxi back to the Tegel airport. It was only 20 euros (6 persons and our luggage)! Never found smaller rooms for single travellers. No recommendation for business trips. Bathroom is to small, useing the toilet was a problem... Breakfast was okay, also the drinks at the bar. Location is quite good, near the ""Kaufhaus des Westens"" and the tube A2 (good for drives to the ""Messe Berlin""). Stayed in triple room for 3 nights with family. Room was very spacious, warm and clean towels & toiletries supplied daily. Staff were very polite and friendly. Couldn't fault this hotel and would stay again if I return. Central to all including Ka Da We (big dept store) and 2 great restaurants around the corner Spanish & Turkish!! Great if you arrive late and too tired to get your bearings. Try both you wont be disappointed!! I had a 3 night stay in this hotel during Christmas, which it has a buy-2-get-1-free promotion. At 50 euros a night, I don't expect something spectacular but it was quite wonderful anyway. It's a block from the famous Kadewe shopping center with loads of cafes along its street. It's 1/2 block away from the closest metro station Augsburger Strasse. Note that such station does not have escalator / elevators (as many metro stations don't). From airport you may take a bus to zoologischer garten station, where you can take a metro change to there (which requires line change for that 2 stations distance and ups/downs of stairs during the change) or walk from there to hotel that needs about 10-15min. I guess they upgraded our room so it was quite big with a balcony (kinda useless in winter) where we can see the quiet street and its neighbourhood. The rooms + beds are basic (the professional photos would've fooled you) but clean and comfy. Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful responding inquiries in perfect English. There's also a gym + spa + sauna facility upstairs at 6th floor. One small complaint would be the free WIFI. Though free, it needs a unique user/password pair per day per device - kind of annoying, and the service gets cut off easily when I reached my room. Overall this hotel is still a great place for tourist to stay. We spent two nights in this hotel because we had a smart box as a christmas gift. The hotel is really comfortable and clean, just 15 minutes from Tegel airport by taxi, and about 30 minutes with public transportation. If you travel for tourism, the position isn't the best, to get to the centre you have to take two different subway lines, and takes about 20 minutes, but you can easily take a tourist ticket, that also includes the entrances to a few museums, with wich you can also reach Potsdam. The hotel offers a nice breakfast, with a good choice of fresh fruit, yogurt and croissants. If you have to choose a place for dinner, the turkish resturant nex to the hotel is excellent! Great hotel! Extremely clean and well-furnished. We felt very safe while here, and the room was very quiet with a nice view of the courtyard and a view of the street between neighboring buildings. The rooms were a little small compared to what I'm used to in the U.S., but certainly adequate and the quality of our stay was enough to make all the difference! The beds and pillows were very comfortable, and the linens delightfully fresh! My only complaint was that the duvet thing provided was WAY too hot! The room is kept warm enough you could sleep with just a sheet though. There are no in-room temperature controls, but even as picky as I am I had no issue. It was incredibly cold outside and the entire hotel was perfectly warm without being suffocating. The bathroom, always a telling point of any hotel room, was very nice! Everything was impeccably clean, but remember to leave the door cracked when taking a hot shower as there is no vent fan. I was unfortunately very ill on our trip to Berlin, and the hotel staff at the desk showed great concern for me once it was mentioned by our guide. There were members of our group who had last-minute changes in their room preferences and the staff were very quick and friendly about accommodating them. There seemed to be a lot of rooms available, even though there were people seemingly everywhere. It was a busy, but polite and inviting place. The restaurant downstairs was very nice. We visited for dinner one night and had great food at the usual price for dinner anywhere out in Germany. The restaurant staff was perfect. The breakfast included in our tour looked like it was good, but unfortunately I am not a morning person and was unable to enjoy any since I always feel worse in the mornings when sick. As with most hotels, the snacks and fizzy beverages in the fridge will cost you if you partake. Bring your own snacks/drinks and save the money! I feel like I found a bit of home at the Alsterhof and I plan to return whenever I visit Berlin again. My husband and I visited Berlin for Veterans day Weekend. We stayed for 2 nights. Our hotel price was 67 euros a night plus 16 euros a night for parking, which we weren't extremely happy about. We enjoyed the hotel. We opted for the smaller double vs the deluxe. Other reviewers complained about small rooms. The room was small, but definitely did the job. We had room for all our bags. Closet space and shelves. The bathroom was extremely small and clean and also did the job. There was free wi-fi once we obtained the password from reception. It appeared that it wasn't connected but worked okay. We never tried it from the lobby so I don't know if it would have been better there. The hotel was walking distance from some major shopping areas, but not to the Brandenberger Tor (Gate). I believe the Gate was about 3 miles away. There is a Netto (small grocery store) which is very close and train stations. The 100 bus runs close to the hotel also, as other reviewers mention. The reception staff spoke English very well, were very friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel is pretty clean, the staff friendly, the bar at lobby veru cosy and the breakfast buffet is excellent. The hotel is also =well located near a subway station and the famous Kurfurstenstrasse. The only negative point is that there is no air conditioning and we were in the middle of summer and fan was not enough. But it did not diminiched the great imopression we have about this hotel Althought I'm quite pleased with my stay in this hotel, I expected a little bit more. I wouldn't rate this hotel as a four star, maybe three of three and a half. The room was clean and cozy, nice staff and location great! But my room was very hot (in April!!), no air conditioner and breakfast for 12 e was nothing special. We spent a very comfortable 5 nights in the Alsterhof. It is in a quiet, pleasant and convenient location close to two U Bahn stations and about 10 minutes walk from a main station at Zoogarten. The famous KaDeWe departmental store is less than 5minutes walk away. The hotel staff are efficient, friendly and helpful.The croissant breakfast inc udes, fruit salad, fruit juices,cereals,youghurts, cheese, cold meats, rolls and jams. We booked direct and got a special deal for booking 3+ nights. Although not the basis of our trip this hotel is clearly well suited for business and conference users Travelling around Berlin is very easy and we would recommend the Berlin Welcome card for inclusive travel on trains,S Bahn, UBahn and Buses. If you wish to visit the Reichstag you MUST apply in advance on the relevant website before going to Berlin. We were disappointed as we were unaware of this recent requirement. Enjoyed staying in this Hotel. Found the rooms very clean good bathroom/shower, great value and right in the middle of the city near all the attractions. I found the reception desk staff very friendly & helpful. If you you do not have breakfast included in your rate there are plenty of cafes nearby. Will go back to this hotel. Originally, we did not book at the Alsterhof but due to the incompetence and inconsideration of the management of the Golden Tulip Hamburg (please read our separate review), we were forced to stay at this hotel. If it werenât for this unfortunate circumstance, we admit that we probably would not have booked at the Alsterhof due its lower ranking and room pictures in the Tripadvisor, which were not appealing. The rooms at the Alsterhof did NOT have air conditioning. While we were in Berlin on 8-10 June 2010, the outside temperature ranged 28-30 degree Celsius so it was hot out. And in the rooms, we felt steamy and sweated through the nights in spite of having opened the windows. Although some of the rooms did have portable electric fans, they did little in cooling off the sauna-like rooms. If you like sleeping naked but still drenched in sweat during the summer, then this hotel is for you. On a more positive note, this hotel is centrally located, very near to Kadewe, one of Berlinâs largest up-market department stores. Additionally, we felt that the breakfast was decent. If you do decide to stay in this hotel, make sure that you ask for a newly renovated room at the front part of the hotel (the back wing is old and dilapidated). Finally, there is a computer at the lobby with free internet, but it was always occupied. There is no WiFi in the rooms or other public areas. In summary, you could probably find a better stay in Berlin somewhere else.",,,
Robyn L,324710,"We stayed her for three nights. The rooms were definitely not four star. The toilet leaked which showed obvious signs of prior repair, the heated towel rail, the electrics did not looks safe so we did not use this. We told the reception about the toilet on checking out and got no real response. Housekeeping would have been aware as it was obvious there was a problem with water leaking onto the floor. The overall decor of the room was also quiet old. However, overall the staff were friendly and we had breakfast daily which was adequate for the size of the hotel. The supermarket opposite was useful, however there are not many restaurants in the area. We did eat at the one opposite on two evenings which was good with the lady very friendly. Would not go back - location also even though we can access metro's easily, still felt we were not central to main attractions etc. This hotel is in a great position, its down a quiet street not to far from anything. Just a short cab ride away you can be at most tourist places in Paris. The staff were very friendly and very helpful whether it was directions you were after or a nice place to eat. We would recommend this to any traveller. This hotel is in a great position, its down a quiet street not to far from anything. Just a short cab ride away you can be at most tourist places in Paris.

We arrived late in the night and had made arrangements for a late check in but our room that we had booked for 4 nights was given away and they put us into the Viennese No.2 or so they called it. It was a dump I have seen closets bigger than the room they gave us, and there was three of us. The bathroom or what they called the bathroom had a shower curtain that went around the toilet and a towel at the door so the water wouldn't run into the room. A total was of time and money beware do not book this hotel its a dump. We arrived in Toronto on the Thursday before Thanksgiving in the middle of rush hour(we are British, so had no idea this was happening!), but One King West was very easy to find, thank God! It's location is great, right in the middle of the financial district, close to the theatre district. A short 5 / 10 minute stroll takes you to the theatres and where a lot of the eateries are. The room itself was nice, clean and quite spacious. We had a kitchenette in ours, with a washer and dryer we were very thankful for as we were doing a lengthy drive around the US and Canada, so as you can imagine we had a big pants and socks wash to do! The only thing that I wasn't keen on was being on the 36th floor, the lift was quick, but I personally am not very good with heights. Ask for a room on one of the lower floors of you are the same. Overall a very good hotel, they have a nice bar (it's a little pricey) and the staff are very customer focused. We stayed her for three nights. The rooms were definitely not four star.

Would not go back - location also even though we can access metro's easily, still felt we were not central to main attractions etc. Excellent location when attending a function at the Opera House. Our standard room was excellent with a view over Circular Quay. Dinner at The Bar was excellent in value and taste. The decor is old world, calm and relaxing. We would certainly not hesitate to stay at Sir Stamford again and booking early ensures a good rate.","This little hotel has very good location - is in the city center. Is just 20 meters from Termini Station, so you can take a metro and in 3 stops you reach Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Fontain di Trevi. Clean, nice rooms with air conditioning and with a laptop with free WiFi. Big television with SKY (gratis). Staff very helpfull. Good relation price/benefit. Do not ever stay here it is shocking.

sam h,82688,"At a glance the room was nice, however looks can be deceiving. The room was smaller than I expected, It was very dirty. What was really gross was the tub, it looked like it needed to be bleached it was so black. The bath mat looked like it was about 20 years old as well and never washed. The bed we slept on was hard as a rock and so I had horrible back pains. I also found hair on the pillows and sheets which grossed me out. The room comes equipped with a complimentary coffee machine with coffee... that was dirty with dried up coffee... one night there was band playing music from 8pm-3am nearby that kept us awake. We paid over 220$ with taxes and fees for two nights.. totally not worth it. Don't even bother! The free breakfast was a joke and you are better driving to starbucks. SO DISAPPOINTING!

Stayed here with my husband for a week trip. We drove to LA for one day, and had driven in from las vegas and went downtown sandiego for a few days. Hotel was nice and clean, but nothing to shout about. If you want a basic hotel that will supply breakfast every morning (Which was pretty good, except for the fruit) this is your hotel. If you are looking for upscale luxury, this is not the place! you can hear the freeway in your room, and the tvs are older, but we weren't there most of the time, it was literally just a room to sleep, change and store our things This hotel fulfilled our need to avoid traffic and public transportation congestion to go to a Chargers game at Qualcomm Stadium. We stayed on a Saturday night/Sunday night for $100.00 a night. We flew a long way to get there. The hotel is close to Qualcomm and Grantville MTS trolley station. We walked to and from the stadium with ease. We dined at a Chili's nearby as well. There was a freeway outside the room and it would have proven to be loud had we not drunk so much beer. I would stay here again if I was going to a Chargers game. There were a ton of fans using the hotel for the same purposes and it was a great atmosphere. The hotel met our expectations but I would not use it as a base of operations for seeing San Diego. Rest assured that there are multiple other options within the city or closer to beaches. Judging by some of the poorer reviews listed here, you can see that many transient guests used this hotel for city touring purposes and were disappointed. Although I question the reason why they choose this option for those purposes, I can see legitimacy in their complaint. So as noted in the title of the review, go for the game, otherwise make a more informed choice. We stayed here on Nov 19th (Sat) as we came into town for a football game. Keep in mind this wasn't some romantic weekend kind of thing, but we just needed a place that was clean, comfortable and centrally located to Qualcomm Stadium. I was very surprised as to how clean the facility was! My room was comfortable with upgraded mattress on the bed which was great. The bathroom was very clean, with no pubs missed by hurried staff. The rooms decor was current, but not over the top. Quite comfortable for around $70 / night!! Price even included a complimentary waffle bar breakfast the next morning. I will definitely stay there again under similar circumstances. Outside of being punched in the head, this has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Let's start with the fact I drove 9 hours and encountered heavy traffic in heavy rain starting in Orange County, then found out where this hotel was really located. From the online description the hotel being near Seaworld and the Zoo I figured it really might have been, but it WAS NOT. The hotel is a motel-style high rise hotel with a couple of wings. The front overlooks a parking lot that borders the very busy Highway 8 through Mission Valley. The back overlooks several light industrial business and a thoroughly polluted small creek. The only good thing is that it's close to the Grantville station of the San Diego Trolley. The rooms were spartan, there were cockroaches (that we found on our food), and the night we stayed a fire alarm went off near midnight and wasn't shut off for over 35 minutes. We had such a miserable experience in a toxic creek view room that we checked out early even though we'd paid and drove speedily to a nice boutique hotel downtown. This is the worst place I have stayed in San Diego. Booked a week and stayed only 4 days even though I was fully paid for 7. The staff is rude. The breakfast is a joke. Charged my card for a safe that I never used and they never informed me about. They refused to refund the safe fee when I called to ask what the charge on my card was for. Don't bother hanging the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your door. Maid service just barged in, no knock or anything. I have been on the road for 6 months now and I must say, this is by far the crappiest stay I have had. Hotel was good value, area is not that attractive, as right next to the freeway but easy enough to get around with a car. Facilities are good and staff are helpful.rooms are clean and comfortable. Booked the hotel for the location. While near the highway, very quiet. The hotel was clean, recently painted. The rooms were slightly small. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast was better than the Comfort Inn. This hotel is perfect for a few day stay on a budget. I spent 5 nights there. It was clean. I felt safe. The neighborhood is light industrial/business with a car dealership, Home Depot, lots of places to eat for all budgets, Kaiser Permanente, grocery and drugstore, etc. The building exterior looks like it has been painted recently. The pool, gym and laundry room were all well maintained. The interior of my room looked recently renovated. No weird smells. Everything worked. Cold AC. Its near the freeway and I could hear some street noise outside, but not at all inside the room. All I heard was a wooosh from the train that passes overhead, not a harsh metal sound. I was concerned that at the price, there would be teens partying and other shady characters. Not at all. The other guests were mostly business travelers, families and tourists. Front desk service was surperb. The breakfast lady was friendly and efficient. My room was serviced perfectly. They really do arrange the pillows the way its shown on the website. No extra charge for the computer and printer in the lobby. Two freeway exits from SDSU. A short drive to the shopping district. San Diego Brewing Company is a nearby restaurant with good food, great prices and excellent service. If you're looking for a five star resort experience there are many options for you in SD. If you want a cheap, clean, safe place to stay with a pool and free breakfast choose this place! Mahalo! This was 1 of 3 hotels we stayed in during our visit to San Diego. I chose this hotel for 3 nights because of the price and we werenÃ¢â¬â¢t going to spend a lot of time in the room. Cons: 1. Location is right next to freeway and there is nothing walking distance. If your room is on the side facing the freeway you will hear the cars passing when the room a/c is not on. 2. There is a pool but it is on the freeway side. Pros: 1. Price of $60 from otel site is a very good deal expecially with the nice breakfast. . 2. Breakfast included - make your own waffles with 2 heavy-duty waffle makers, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, breads, muffins, danish, cereals. But Juices are watered down. 3. Room was clean, beds ok. Some rooms do have refrigerator. The 1st night had one but when we came back for 3'rd and 4th night, this room did not. 4. Marie Calendar and DZ Akins (NY style deli) restaurants are close by. 5. There is a fitness center that is small with about 4 pieces of equipment but at least there is one. This hotel is adequate if you just need a place to sleep and want a very nice breakfast included. Ask for a room away from the freeway. This hotel is a two star motel but no way is it a hotel. It is situated right on a busy highway as a result there is a heavy noise al the time. The room itself was kind of OK no complaints regarding cleanliness. However the exterior access hallways did have a strong urine odor .We spent a minimum time inside for our one night stay and we been happy when we left the hotel.I wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t stay there again. We stayed here for 2 nights with our 2 yo daughter. Gave up a teeny-tiny room with a microwave and fridge for a more spacious room sans micro and fridge, but double beds. Rooms are updated and very clean. Conveniently located near freeway, so easy to get around San Diego, and I believe the trolly is near by as well. Even though it is next to the freeway, the noise was not an issue for us. Breakfast was good, very well stocked, so no issue as to what time you showed up for it. Internet access was great. Management called us on our second day and had to switch our room, yet again, for a plumbing issue (don't know if it was adjacent to us), but they were very kind about it, and we had no issue moving. Luckily they caught us before we left for the zoo. we went to sandeigo fro the family vacation. and stayed at this toel . very frendly and quite hotel. all the staff member are nice and very nicely dressed. manager was really frendly. very helpful with my kids. nice atmospher.. will go thereat every time whn i will visit san deigo ... very nice place to stay..... best place",,,

My friend and I were in this hotel for a 4 day trip in Amsterdam (my travel agency booked it). Manouk de Witte, who is responsible for the Bookings, was really very helpfull giving us all important information requeried. I got every single mail answered before we arrived. The rooms are very clean, big and confortable . Room 3018 wonderfull panorama!! the breakfast buffett (was included in our hotel package), was just ""great"", such a variation of food!!!. The staff was very friendly, specially in the small restaurant in the evenings. The prices are not expensive because the portions are really big, so you can share with your partner. The hotel is only about 10/15 minutes to walk to the Tram station (Overamsel), from there you are in only 10 minutes in Centraal Station. Just watch out: you have to go on top of the bridge when you leave Overamsel station,( fisrt you go under the bridge to get out of the station, and then you have to ""go on top of the bridge""), to get to the hotel. You canÃÂ´t reach the hotel if you go under the bridge. Thank you very much to all the staff from Mercure Hotel, we had a great time in Amsterdam and defentely recomend this hotel . We will come again!!!! Quiet, Clean, great bed with ceiling fan over it, good breakfast, good location between Universal and Disney.. Would stay again.

Towels have been changing, bath accessories have been renewing every day! Good location. All what you need. We had lovely vacation in Italy, and Rome was wonderful and was our last stop. We stayed in this hotel just two nights. But were very very dissapointed. As some others wrote everything was bad. 1. Service and staff were unbelievable unfriendly. They did not want to help or they did not want to talk. Breakfest staff and service were unbelivable poor. Also they were like angry at oss all the time, like: ""go away, we dont like tourists and would like to have our hotel emty rather"". I had feling like this. 2. Many stairs, difficult with luggage and baby pram. 3. You can say that there is no breakfest att all, so bad it was. And lady working at breakfest was unbelivable unfreindly. The only good thing was location, it was close to central station and all nice things to see. I understad that it is cheap hotle with little stars, but I would not give any star to this hotel. Because so bad staff working there. Stay away, there must be some nicer cheap hotels in same area.",,,
Hillbillycat,2514558,"Great location near the Prado museum and many nice restaurants close by. I am not particular fond of design hotel but this one is neat and clean and the staff is very service minded (and speaks good English which you can not expect in Madrid). Small but good buffet breakfast. The entrance and the lobby are very nice but the floors are not the same standard and the rooms are in need of refurbishing (even though you can see they were once very modern). The service is good by South-European standards (my only complaint is that if you need an iron you need to come down to reception to sign a indemnity letter which is at least a first time for me). If you are a business travel and had your (more than) fair share of hotel breakfasts I would recommend taking a left when coming out of the hotel and have a great morning espresso and sandwich at the small coffee shop on the opposite side of the streetl. The location is good and walking distance to Piazza Navona, the Pantheon and shopping. I would probably expect a bit more for what they are normally charging but when I stayed there we had a good corporate discount. P.S This hotel offers promotions to guest that give them positive feedback on Tripadvisor but this review is not in any way biased by this. D.S. The hotel has loads of charm, a very good location and great bars and restaurants within its premises. The lounge area is perfect for entertainment or just a quick dinner working with your laptop. Home House has the look and feel of a English club which have been updated to the requirements of the 21st century with great care to the small details that truly make a hotel stand out from the rest. The rooms are large by London standards and really feel homely. The only complaint is that staff and service doesnât really live up towhat I would expect at that price but if you are not on a budget (its hard to claim maximum value for money) and not have very high demands on service (i.e the type of person that gives the hotel a bad review for having to wait 3 min to check in) you should defiantly try Home House even though that you after the initial passion has left may you notice that everything isnât as perfect as you thought, still it is a great place to stay. The hotel has loads of charm, a very good location and great bars and restaurants within its premises. The lounge area is perfect for entertainment or just a quick dinner working with your laptop.

I had the pleasure of being invited to Home House last Friday by a friend and what a place it is!! An architectural masterpiece! We arrived around 7pm for some casual drinks at the Bison Bar and the atmosphere was already on top, great crowd with an ecclectic vibe made for a very interesting night to say the least! The cocktails were delicious, especially Portman's Delight, i highly recommend that one. The service was attentive, polite and very firendly- everything you would expect from a Private Members' Club. I certainly will make sure to visit the House again very soon, in my mind it is simply sublime! The Home House, right in the centre of London close to Oxford street, has a big reputation; Classy, Chique, Rich and Famous. Pity thing is that this always attracts a double amount of wannabes. It makes you wonder whether their membership is worth it. It definitely does not stop people gazing through the salons making pictures with you in it. The Home House seems to be a bit short of staff. Even though every one is extremely friendly it does take some time your eager pointing finger or waving hand noticed. Money wise a good thing. Getting drunk on an average of Â£12 for a glass of wine is quite a diet for your wallet. True. The house is beautiful that's a given. The rooms outdated that's a certain. But who does sleep here hoping for a spa in the bathroom or even an a.c.? I slept in the Duke of Atholl suite. Third floor front side. It was the most fantastic autumn weekend with a sweet 28Â° C daytime temperature. My room at night did not get any colder than that. The Duke of Atholl suite is huge and covers almost one third of the front side building. Vestibule, sitting room, bed room and bath room with grandeur. It's like waking up in Pride and Prejudice. Either you like it or you hate it. Leave expectations at home and enjoy because this is by far the funniest place to see London from the inside. You're a part of the London society in-crowd for a weekend. A once in a lifetime experience that no 5 star hotel can ever give you. My verdict? I'd come back just because itâs different.",,,
gachen1,304310,"Honestly, I am not sure if some of the gripes I've read on TripAdvisor are still deserved. From check-in to questions while staying to check-out, the reception staffs have been friendly and helpful. We even asked for late check-out & was granted an extra hour. The rooms are ""dated"" but they're clean & spacious. We booked a room with 2 double beds & have plenty of space for our luggages, space in the closet & space to roam around & work. The heater & TV were working just fine, the shower was hot, the restroom was very clean & the bed comfortable. We also had a good view of the city from our room. The carpet may be ""old-fashioned"" but well-maintained. The hotel is minutes away from Bloor St. in Yorkville, restaurants (from expensive to reasonably priced), shops (from high-end boutiques to a Dollarama store) & the subway line. It was certainly a great value for such a great location & nice room. FYI breakfast consists of simple croissants, bread & orange juice/coffee but this was fine with us as well. Will most likely stay in this hotel the next time we're visiting downtown Toronto! A clean, elegant and hotel at the heart of the city with good value and decent facilities, including free high-speed internet. The beds were comfortable and the restroom was quite nicely designed and spacious. The breakfast was good and the staffs were professional and helpful.","we stayed at the hotel x 3 nights. it looked ok from the outside but when coming into the room the nightmare begins- hairs in the bathtub...stained sheets, and hairs on the toilet seat. :/ no soap, shampoo or anything else in the shower. (and that is supposed to be a 4 star hotel) breakfast was poor.. no normal coffee not even hot water to make a cup of tea. saw the staff putting back uneaten food... horrible. and then on my last day to make this ""lovey"" stay completed. staff stole my favourite shirt from my room. needles to say it was never found in the laundry room like claimed. to sum up- make yourself a favor don't go there. Took 3 nights in the hotel, location is not so great (5-10 minutes from the Ramblas). Worst issue was that the maid stole few shirts from my girlfriend and after complaining and left our details - we had no feedback - but this is not everything. I travelled a lot and visited high quality and low qualiry hotel but this one was very bad: Room was small and dirty. The sheets seemed to be dirty and not washed. We noticed some human hair that was in the bathtub and around the toilet when we got in, smell was bad and the handle for the window was removed so no window can be opened. Unfortunately, breakfast seemed to be cheap and not satisfying, the cultury, plates and glasses was dirty and it was really a shame. I noticed the cleaning lady returning pastries that was not eaten to the fresh baskets - we were shoked. Very bad experience, I don't understand why they get 4 stars - I will recommend not going there. we are from israel and took 2 nights in this hotel. the crew is very nice and the roon is very comfterble. great location. take it! Great hotel! Very clean, comfortable, and most important thing, very close to the center of Barcelona and most famous street La Rambla! If I go again in Barcelona, I will stay there again for sure! Excellent hotel My wife and I were at the hotel a central location great staff We strongly recommend Incredible location near plaza Catalunia very friendly staff and clean rooms(wifi) but with no view of the city at least where i stayed. Nice breakfast with only one argument for me: Really terrible coffee hotel staff were very friendly and helpful room was nicely decorated although there shower leaked a bit so there was smell of dampness but window opened wide like a door (am i wrong in thinking that a lot of hotels could smell like this in a large city) no english speaking tv channels although we had free wi fi which was very good except the cable did not allow the laptop to leave the table disco across the road did wake us alright hotel in good location, nice restraunts nearby easy to find. cent focs, cervecia catalynua on mallorca breakfast was well stocked with plenty of meats, cheese, bread cereal nice coffee altho poorly stocked at weekends better mid week (nice helpful girl must get the weekends off) nothing chilled though, missed that but the coffee and chocolate croissants were lovely. fruit available too. 2 blocks from placa catalyunia excellent walking distance. nice area, plenty of nice shops closeby espirit and zara. would stay there again A clean, elegant and hotel at the heart of the city with good value and decent facilities, including free high-speed internet. The beds were comfortable and the restroom was quite nicely designed and spacious. The breakfast was good and the staffs were professional and helpful. We got the room in 3 hours late!!! (AFTER CHECK-IN TIME) The room wasn't clean at all!! The workers in the reception was so rude and not polite, the service there is BAD! it's really seems that you are talking to yourself...and no one is listening to you... the breakfast was poor!!! and they didnt have any waking call service (at the day of our flight)... unrecommended !!!!!!",,,
adamvega,2514770,"Just wanted to recommend a terrific, affordable and clean place to stay if you're in San Diego! I saw some reviews previous to my visit (a few were negative) but felt inclined to find out for myself if the claims were valid. All in all, I had a very good time at the Vagabond. Let's get the negatives over with first: The room was a little cramped and the bathtub drain was a little clogged. Wasn't that easy? I think the Vagabond IS a business hotel, so I guess it's supposed to be a little spartan. If I had been by myself, I wouldn't have minded a bit. However, for two persons, it was a little small. As for the drain -- stuff happens. I loved the continental waffle breakfast. I loved the location! I loved the parking! The customer service was astute and professional. I liked having coffee and an iron and a hairdryer (did have to ask for that!) in the room. Will not only recommend it but will stay there again next time I'm in San Diego. My stay here is a mixed experience. I enjoyed the small but sparkling room. The complimentary breakfast was excellent (loved the mini pastries!). The location is centrally located and Metro access was a snap. The front desk staff were attentive, bi-lingual and concerned about making sure my needs were taken care of. Some problems that weren't quite resolved was the shoddy (and sometimes non-existent) wifi service. The front desk acknowledged the problem but could not tell me why the service was so poor at times. The early morning seemed to be the only time when 'normal' access/speed was available. The air conditioner was not operating during my seven-day April visit. It seems this was the case throughout the hotel. As the weather swung back and forth between very cool and warm, it sometimes necessitated opening the window to keep things comfortable. That's fine and well during the day but at night -- well, I'll just say it's a little scary to hear the 'sounds of the streets' from a second floor room! I was able to use the air conditioner after the third day but unfortunately, only hot air came from the vents. Overall, my stay was Satisfactory. I think I would actually stay there again but only if the above concerns were resolved. Just wanted to recommend a terrific, affordable and clean place to stay if you're in San Diego!

I think I would actually stay there again but only if the above concerns were resolved. We found this to be a really wonderful Hotel - the staff were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble - the breakfast was basic but plentiful - the cleanliness excellent - would recommend without hesitation - the bathroom was a little small but very clean We have just returned from a last minute short break in Paris and before going I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels and finally settled on the Hotel Peyris. We arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport and caught the Roissy Bus (10 euros) to Opera which was just a 15 minute stroll to the hotel. The hotel proved to be an excellent choice - the location in Opera was a great starting point for getting to most tourist sights. We walked to most of the locations to make sure we saw all the sights. Going by Metro is fine if you accept that you only want to get from A to B and don't mind missing the sights (including excellent cafes/bistros en route). The hotel room (Superior) was very good (albeit a bit on the small side) but well decorated and clean. It would have been nice to have had tea/coffee making facilities in the room but not a major problem. The breakfast provided was excellent with plenty of choice and set in a very nice room. The hotel staff were very friendly and keen to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. We will certainly use this hotel on our next trip to Paris! Stayed at Peyris for 8 nights during my trip to Paris in July. The room given to me must have been one of the ""old"" rooms as it didn't look anything like some of the photos on trip advisor or on other hotel booking websites, but having said that, I had no complaint as everything in the room worked just fine without any fault at all. There was no issues with the cleanliness of the room and the daily housekeeping was efficient, no fault at all. The room was ""small"" but hey, this is Paris, and considering the very good (cheap) rate (breakfast included) I paid for my room, I was more than happy. I thought it was a good value for money. I found the staff members (especially the front office) very helpful and flexible. I arrived very early in the morning and when I filled in my registration card and left my luggage in the luggage room and was just about to go out and about, thinking I would kill half a day until my room would be ready that afternoon, the gentleman who had checked me in told me I was welcome to have breakfast in the breakfast room! A very nice surprise as the breakfast inclusion was to kick in the following morning. I had my first breakfast in Paris (this was my very first trip to Paris) in the very cosy breakfast room, thanks to the staff member and his kindness and attentiveness. The food selection on the buffet wasn't that extensive but I was just satisfied with nice croissants and coffee on offer every day. The location of the hotel was good too as it only took me 5~10 minutes to Grands Boulevards metro station as well as Paris North Station (I took a Thalys train to Bruxelles one day), and even to the Louvre Museum, I could walk in 20~25 minutes. It also took me about 15~20 minutes on foot to get to Galeries Lafayette from the hotel. I have to say, for those who would like to stay right next door to L'Opera or in the middle of Les Halles, no, Hotel Peyris Opera may not provide an ideal location but for well-travelled holiday-makers, I would highly recommend this hotel as their base whilst in Paris. My wife and I stayed in Hotel Peyris for 12 days (yes 12!) from Sept 22nd to Oct 4th 2011. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine. There is a nice French salon available to guests just past the Reception area. The location is good, not far from the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle area which is always lively. A ten minute walk to the Grands Boulevards Metro gives access to the rest of Paris. Note that tickets are not available from the Bonne Nouvelle Metro. All in all I would recommend the Hotel Peyris. Staying in a second hotel on a recent Paris trip [See my review of BEST WESTERN Etoile Saint Honore], this one was worse on a few fronts. First of all the room was nicely designed but extremely small and I am not that Big! The location is a little bit quieter and not in the action so if a good night of sleep is important this place is not bad. The worst thing that happened twice during the 2 nights I stayed was the wake up call not going off. I specifically asked for one to get an early start on sightseeing but ended up waking up at 11:30am in my dark room. Having asked the concierge about it, they said the morning attendant forgot to call. The next morning i was leaving on an international flight and said this could not happen again but of course once again they did not call! Luckily one of the front desk people knowing that i was leaving came up to my room and knocked as the alarm but too bad i only had 15 minutes to pack and get out! We stayed in this hotel twice (in 2008 and 2010, both times in May), and our second choice of Hotel Peyris was done deliberately. Among the advantages of the hotel we can mention: extremely helpful and professional staff (best wishes to Christian, Elena and Irina), perfect location of the Hotel (rue Conservatoire is a calm street and you can rest nicely after intensive all-day promenade round Paris (of course if you prefer 24-hour noise, this is not your hotel) and, at the same time, enjoy good accessibility to major tourist attractions), very close to underground stations (5-7 min to Grands Boulevards, 7-10 min to Cadet and about 10 min to Bonne Nouvelle), and rather substantial continental breakfast. Both times we had a room on the 5th floor with a view to the street, and it was great to see the sunrise engoldening the roofs of Paris. Even a tiny lift in the hotel has its own charm. Thank you for your perfect service, and in case we go to Paris next year, we will undoubtedly choose this hotel which we can recommend most wholeheartedly to everyone who wants to feel real Paris. Everything was excellent. But would like a kettle in room, as been Irish we love our cup of tea. Only required a 1 night stopover in Paris and was lucky enough to find this hotel. Small rooms but this was not a problem. Rooms very clean. Staff very helpful in providing comprehensive directions to the stations that we required. Breakfast typical of what we have had before in other hotels in Paris. My only observation was that I would have liked tea and coffee facilities available in the room, but no major problem. Would have happily stayed for longer, and will return there again when in Paris. I have read some of the not so good reviews of the Peyris and I just can't agree.Maybe you could say the rooms are a bit small but are impeccably clean.We asked for and got adjoining rooms for our teenagers(whoe room was bigger than ours),the staff were so friendly and helpful and the the breakfast was more than adequate.For a couple travelling in Paris this hotel is highly recommended. I have never stayed in a hotel as bad as this. The 'twin beds' were two foot six wide, too narrow to turn in. There was no space to put cases or clothes. The room was beside the fire escape and the locks on the doors weren't great. There wasn't enough room for two people to pass on the corridors. I can't see how such place was passed by the fire authorities. This place should be avoided at all costs. I would prefer to stay at home if I was given a free holiday here.",,,
Mic M,2514527,"My wife and recently stayed three nights in this hotel. We booked before reading TripAdvisor reviews so were in some trepidation when we did seeing the negative comments re room size. We needn't have worried. Yes the rooms are not large by any means but they are fit for purpose, clean and functional. Perhaps those who found their rooms too small couldn't see that the location (less than 5 minutes with heavy cases from Paddington Station) and so close to Hyde Park (a 5 minute stroll) and the top end of town i.e. Marble Arch easily outweighs this minor glitch. The price too should be considered, we paid Â£84 per night for a double on the third floor and had seen similar rooms nearby for much more than that. The staff were unfailingly friendly, helpful and approachable, nothing was too much trouble and all done with a genuine smile and grace. Balance the cost and location against the room size and it's a winner in my book. My wife and recently stayed three nights in this hotel.

Balance the cost and location against the room size and it's a winner in my book. My husband and I stayed there in the 3rd week of May, 2011. The hotel was nice from the outside and even the lobby was beautiful.....we are not picky travelers at all....as long as the room is clean and staff personable....usually all is well......the room was very cramped (typical Eurupeon style, I guess)......our room faced a court yard that contained garbage cans and the smoking staff.....the room had no air conditioning and was extremely hot at night and we had to sleep with the window open (with no screen)...and the first 3 nights we were there we were woke up at 3am to screaming and fighting coming from a room above us on the same 'window shaft"" we were facing....we politely asked the 2nd night of screaming to please be quiet....to no avail....so we called the desk and nothing was done about it....the 3rd night was the same with more drunken screaming and another complaint to the desk at 3am.....the next morning we asked to move rooms and we were told the offending party was checking out that day.....so the management did nothing about the annoying guests....they just left on their own. It is an older hotel and looks very worn away from the desk area, internet in mediocre at best and very intemittant WIFI. The staff was nice to a point, but goodness don't forget you key in your room....you would have thought we were asking for the ""Crown Jewels"" just to borrow a key to get back into our room. The bathroom was very very small....more like a closet.....the bed was very very hard....carpet was worn and dirty.....the breakfast was the exact same breakfast each morning.....the local neighborhood was nice, near lots of restaurants and pubs, Paddington Station was just a block away and on a great bus route and within walking didstance of Hype Park and Buckingham Palace. I personally would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The room was small also small was the beds.A tall man will feel uncorfotable.The bed near the window was cold because the air from outside could enter the spaces of the old window and one night the central heating not working!And now the good points: The staff was very polite.The location of the hotel is near Paddington underground station I visited this hotel earlier this week for a 2 night stay and was delighted with the hotel. Although the 'double bed' was tiny our room had a shower room and tea/coffee making facilities as well as a hair drier and TV. The complimentary breakfast was also more than I expected - a buffet offered scrambled eggs, sausages & baked beans, toast and marmalade and excellent coffee. We were able to park our car directly outside the front entrance in a gated secure area for a daily fee of Â£15. The nearby tube station (Lancaster gate) allowed us easy access into the West End. I would recommend this hotel and would gladly stay here again. Stayed here for two nights, room small but spotlessly clean. Staff and Manager very friendly. Problem with the water from shower getting on to floor of bathroom, but a couple of towels soon did the trick. Breakfast was fine. Scrambled egg, sausage and beans. Toast, cheese, ham and jams. Staff will bring your tea or coffee to the table. Would definately stay here again and would reccommend it to anyone. Just around the corner from Paddington train and underground station. Hyde park a five minute walk away. We had a triple room.It was on the small side but served its purpose.Very clean.Room serviced everyday.We stayed for 4 nights and found it suitable to our needs.Breakfast was on the lower ground,buffet style.Staff attentive and polite.For the price we paid for 4 nights for a triple room it was very good value.I wouldn't have expected a breakfast included in the price, especially for London! We obviously were out all day and only used the room for sleeping as there was nowhere really to sit apart from the beds.Around the corner from the hotel there are plenty of eating places,shops and Paddington Underground and main station.Literally a stones throw.It is a lovely area with beautiful old buildings as hotels and trees lining the road.So easy to get into and around London,bus stops around the corner,taxi's,underground.An ideal place to stay if you are sight seeing I read lots of reviews about the hotel before we went and had two minds as there are mixed reviews . We weren't disappointed and don't believe everything you read. We have high standards and couldn't fault the cleanliness and polite staff. We would stay there again. The location is good: a few minutes from Paddington main line station and from Hyde Park. The rooms are average, but the hotel shows sign of wear and tear. The bathrooms are tiny, and the breakfast dire (tasteless beans and scrambled eggs) but for the price we couldn't find anything to beat it. There are a few fast-food restaurants within walking distance, but better fare is a good walk away. Internet goes to sleep at 10 p.m. (?!) and the rooms are small, but we've stayed there before and we'll stay there again. If you want luxury in this area the Hilton is Â£100 more. First the good points: Staff very friendly and helpful. Good central location. Good pub (Sawyers Arms round the corner!) Now the bad points: Despite the foyer being quite stylish and welcoming everything goes down hill from there. Decor dated and shabby. Room is the smallest I have ever stayed in. Struggled to store our suitcases and move around in general. ""Double"" room had single wardrobe. 14"" tv only had 5 channels (Â£10 deposit for remote control) Had to queue and then share a table for breakfast. Breakfast in general was the cheapest and nastiest I have ever had from a hotel. Stayed four days had one breakfast (decided I rather go without!!!) The hotel was very clean, the staff helpful and the location excellent. Although my room was very small, it was quiet and I had a good couple of nights sleep. The breakfast was adequate but the ""aquarium"" in the breakfast room almost put me off eating there. Too many fish in too little space, no vegetation and nowhere for the fish to hide. Vile and cruel! I hope the management does away with it. We booked this hotel for one night only as we were staying the rest of our trip at the Ramada Jarvis, Hyde Park but couldn't get this one night there and wanted something nearby!! The hotel looked lovely from outside and the reception was lovely, we were given our room key and directed to the room which was on the basement floor! This room was the most pokey small awful room i had stayed in. it was uncomfortably hot, smelt foistly and the decor was from the stone ages!! i went back to reception asking to be moved i was told all the rooms were the same but i could try another to see if it was cooler, i did and it was so we moved. The room standard was no better though!! You literally couldn't swing a cat, ive taken some photos but couldn't move back far enough to get much of the room in each one. The breakfast was catered for european guests and was nothing flash, whilst your sitting eating yours there is a que of other guests overlooking you waiting for you to finish yours so they can have your table... nice!! Wouldnt go back here ever i could have paid Â£30 for a travel lodge and done better!! Ramada Jarvis Hyde Park was 100% better in every way!! Value for money - I'm not sure - there was not a lot to choose from when I booked. The room was small but the hotel was close to Paddington Station, to Hyde Park, restaurants and there was a shopping area including a laundromat nearby. They had free WIFi but unfortunately it was not available in the room, you had to come down to reception to access it. A full breakfast was included in the rate and that was very good. We found the staff friendly and helpful. Great staff, beautiful decor, good enough sized room and bathroom, decent breakfast. I stayed there for 4 nights and the room was adequate as we spent the day out, the beds were very comfortable and the bedding clean and new. The bathroom is good sized but shower stall is small. Surprisingly the hotel has a new elevator, which I know is a luxury in less expensive hotels in Europe. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was continental, with some english touches like sausage, beans and eggs. We were on the second floor and street was noisy at night, with a pub directly below, but closing the window solved the problem. I'd definitely stay there again, as it's perfectly located for tourists, at a very short walk to Paddington Station, with the subway system and trains directly into Heathrow and out to places like Windsor. The area is also very pretty and tranquil, with many restaurants nearby, banks, etc. Clean, comfortable, very quiet, and nice staff. A perfect place near tube.",,,
Irene N,804678,"I have never meet a group of warm hearted and friendliest people that worked at a hotel. The staff at the Acacia Boutique hotel was all that. When I return back to Pureto Rico this is where I want to stay. My mother and myself went for my 50th birthday and I couldn't pick a better place. We visited Sydney for a friends wedding and were looking for somewhere that was centrally located, within walking distance to shops, restaurants and public transport and was self contained. This property ticked all those boxes. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had an enjoyable stay and give us pointers on places to visit as we were unfamiliar with Sydney. Rooms are modern and clean and although there was some street noise, we were expecting this, being the city. We will be returning. I stayed here for 5 nights and couldn't get over the size of the suite for the price I paid. It was so nice to have a separate living room area to relax in. I found the staff very helpful and accommodating during my stay. I did use the small gym area which was quite adequate. Overall I was very happy.","We visited Sydney for a friends wedding and were looking for somewhere that was centrally located, within walking distance to shops, restaurants and public transport and was self contained.

Our relatives came with us when we first arrived and couldn't believe how nice it was. It was great value for money and had everything we needed. Thanks Laura for staying late and waiting for us when our flight was late...you're a star.. We stayed here for 7 nights in early September. We were attracted to the hotel because the rooms were self contained and we could prepare a quick meal if we felt like it. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and found our room to be spacious, light and modern. While there is street noise in the area we were expecting this being an inner city area. Overall we found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the housekeeping staff efficient happy to assist with any requests. This is a very centrally based apartment which is conveniently located in the heart of Kings Cross and near to all amenties, Coles supermarket is practically on your doorstep, if you needed to stock up on anything, in this self catering apt, which i found to be regularly cleaned and towels where changed very regular to. Staff where extremely friendly & helpful. Yes at night you will experience the nightlife of bussling Kings Cross which is to be expected, however it was bearable. I liked the fact that the apts where easy access to all transport links taxis/buses/trains so was ideal, this was my first time in Oz and would happily return to this accom again, really pleased with overall location, cleanliness and friendly staff, hope to return back again one day. This is a good service apartment if you do not mind 24-hour of non-stop noise like drunk ""mates"", cars, police & ambulance sirens, bats etc... from the street even though windows are shut. Well... you can see the feedback on noise from others. Well... it is true. I will describe how it really is for those wondering between conflicting feedbacks. The window frames are a little loose and basically you are hearing the noise directly from the street. Just consider it as you are sleeping on street as far as noise concerned. But hey this is Kings Cross, the true center of night! If you are one of them (here to make noise), why would you complain about the noise from others. If you are looking for a peaceful nights, KIngs Cross is very wrong place to start with anyway. So, having all that said, hotel management takes your ""feedback"" with smile when you complain about the noise, and you will surely get some free ear plugs from them. To be fair, ""apartment features"" like the washing machine, kitchen, space... are OK. I would not call this a great service apartment compared to decent ones like Medina and Panthill, but if you got nothing else available for the time, just go for it with ear plugs. There are nice restaurants around the corner, too. Really budget accommodation - just not worth it, find the extra $50 a night and stay somewhere decent! The place is horribly noisy, despite being put in a 'quieter' room. I mean, it's on a constantly noisy road and sounds as though the windows are open. Rooms - they're fine - plenty of space, decent enough bed, good enough kitchen etc Cleanliness - poor - someone's hairs through the bathroom (unpleasant) Location - it's really Kings Cross and, ultimately, a dodgy hole that noone should experience Cost - it's cheap - I mean, you probably get what you pay for but I wouldn't allow my cheap-as company to put me up in such a poor place again. Staff - nice enough but they know very little about the restaurants etc around the area. Don't do it. Stayed at Annam for 2 weeks. Courteous and friendly staff. We were welcomed and made to feel very comfortable. The apartment was clean and well appointed. The apartments are situated close to Kings Cross - so there was some noise at night but nothing as bad as described in the other reviews! We travelled with our 15 month old daughter. Although the apartment is not specifically designed for children the management provided a good quality travel cot. The only problem was that, as the flat was a studio type flat, we had to be very quiet once our daughter had gone to bed - so the tv had to be kept on a low volume. I would heartily recommend!! I only chose Annam apartments because for the period I was staying in Sydney for a conference (5 days), it was literally the last hotel left with a room in my allowed budget ($100 - $200 per night), and within walking distance of the CBD. After reading the other reviews on this site, I was not looking forward to my stay! However, my stay there was so pleasant and convenient that I wanted to write this (my first) tripadvisor review. Provided the rates continue to offer excellent value, it will probably be my first choice when I next visit Sydney. The Good - Rooms are pleasingly modern, well-appointed and furnished - The manager (Adam) was friendly, courteous, and accommodating - Pleasant 20min walk to the city - Great cafe ('Uliveto') around the corner (which I visited on Adam's recommendation) - Free, fast and flawless wi-fi, which was very much appreciated The Bad - The noise levels at certain times: road noise during peak times and in the evenings, and the shouts of revellers leaving nearby pubs late on Fri & Sat nights. However: After my first night, I asked for earplugs from reception, and the rest of my nights I slept very soundly. Honestly, I believe that wearing earplugs completely negates this 'bad' point. Overall: A hidden gem that many people will pass over because of the noise. Ask reception for earplugs, and you'll have a wonderful stay. Firstly its soo loud you can hear everything down the street, its horrible my partner didnt sleep at all I got sleep but was cranky and very unsettled the whole time I was there. The lights kept breaking every day we had showers in the dark. The next morning the toaster was broken. The maintenance guy walked in and let himself in the room while I was still there alone. I called the front desk to let them know the problem is the whole switch board as the kettle wouldn't work either. I asked if I could move into another room and he said no chance and the only option was to check out.. without any apologies for the ongoing issues ( I even bought my own light globes to fix the bathroom after the emergency line wasn't answered at night when it broke) I was treated with no respect and called 'darling' and it seemed it was a hassle for them to have me stay the whole week when really it was a hassle for me to deal with the ongoing issues of the apartment and disgraceful management. I am appalled by the conditions and the staff even the management was rude and unhelpful. It is a scam and a joke. Do not stay here. The quality of the rooms is decent and even the studio that I stayed in was pretty spacious. Basic amenities are included. The only concern as mentioned by other travelers is that the hotel is located at a very busy crossroads and does not seem to have any sound insulation. As a result, when someone walks past and is speaking it seems as if you are next to them downstairs rather than in your room. The traffic noise is pretty disturbing as well. I wouls suggest taking this room if you get at least a 30% discount off their advertised price and can prenegotiate a higher floor, at least 3rd floor. Also, for some reason it took me over an hour to get a taxi! Internet quality was poor.",,,
vicky_lb1,280223,"Rome was the first stop of our Italy vacation and Hotel Canova set high standards for our hotel expecations! The customer service was amazing, and I've stayed in many 4-5 star resorts and they were good. Magdelena at the front answered any questions we asked from diing recommendations to questions about Italy. The rooms were very clean but most importantly, the air conditioner worked and was AMAZING. Especially important after trekking throughout Rome all day. The breakfast that came with the room was served on a very cute, clean terrace and the breakfast spread was nice. Simple, yet they took pride in the food put out and were so nice. Our only complaint was that although advertised as by the Collosseum, it was a little further away. To get to any nightlife ie: Pantheon, woudl either have to take a cab or bus. Either way, Metro system and bus system was easy enough to use and understand so wasn't too much of a problem. Also, not many good restaurants within short walking distance (Within a 2 block radius) Really good for people who don't want to sacrifice clean room and good air conditioning for location. During our trip to Italy we went to Rome, Florence, Venice and Milan- this hotel was not the most expensive during the trip but it was the nicest! After ""booking"" room at fastbooking.com, I selected a superior view room with a city view and when we checked in we were welcomed to a huge suite. There was a private sitting area, large bathroom and private balcony facing the church right next to the hotel. We stayed for two nights and and well worth the money- was not that expensive. We chose this hotel because it was right near St. Mark's Square and very close to the water. The only complaint about the location was its on the last vaporetto stop from the train station and the hotel tells you to take vaporetto #1- which takes 45 minutes. Tip: Stop right in front of hotel is zaccarri jolanda. Restaurant da Roberto had a really good lobster spaghetti Hotel has grand canal worthy location but without the hustle and bustle of tourists.","We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel. Its simple and clean. Rooms cleaned and every night but even if we put our towels on the floor they were not changed. But there were soaps and shampoo in the bathroom, a bidÃ© and good shower. We stayed on the 3rd floor with window to the inner courtyard so it wasn't very noisy, but as I am a light sleeper I always bring earplugs. Our travel companions stayed on the 2nd floor with window to the street and found it very noisy. Breakfast was fine: toasts, yoghurts, juices, good coffee (we asked the very nice breakfast-lady to make us caffe-latte in the kitchen) and sweets. The only thing I missed was some fresh fruit. All reception-staff friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the headboard, old-fashioned covered in fabric. Find it a bit unhygienic.. And for staying in central Rome you pay more for this hotel than a similar further from city center. Friendly, articulate reception staff. Room very small and basic with characteristically dark old furniture. Bed comfortable. Bathroom with small shower cubicle. Loved the thick towels. Terracota tiled floors in bedroom - good when hot but not so good when cold. Air conditioning and heating appeared to be centrally controlled despite a notice advising visitors to push the card into the slot and wait for 15 minutes for the air conditioning to kick in. When I enquired about this at reception I was informed that they hadn't switched it on. I gave up in the end and just opened the window. Rooms in public and private areas very clean. Buffet breakfast choice adequate but no hot dishes available. Breakfast room is interestingly querky - alcoves, walls painted like frescoes ... Hotel in quiet side street close to metro, terminii and centre - nearest to Forum and Colloseum, Hotel near to several restaurants and cafes serving good quality food at reasonable prices. Staff was friendly. The location was a bit farther from the train / metro stations than preferred. The bus lines are pretty close and make up for this. The room we were given was very clean and nicely decorated. The shower did not drain very well and there was an ongoing issue with plumbing as the bathroom contained a drain in the center of the floor where typically no water should be. It is an older building so we could contantly hear water going through drain pipes. You may want to monitor the contruction going on across the street. It made for a really noisy breakfast one morning of the three days we were there. These are fair trade-offs for a less expensive stay in the city. We booked this hotel, based on the Trip Advisor recommendations. It was ""Perfect"" for us. Close to the train station, metro, many shops and restaurants. Everything was within walking distance including the Coleseum and Forum. The staff helped with directions and restaurant suggestions. We ate in different restaurants each night all a short walk from the hotel. We had a small room with balcony facing a fairly quite street and a large bathroom with shower. This is just a block from Via Cavior, a very busy street and Maria Maggiore Church a Hop-on-Hop off bus stop. I would recommend this hotel and hope to stay there in the future. We were two middle/elderly ladies and found this to be a great little hotel. We opted for breakfast on the terrace and it was a great way to start our busy days. Front desk staff were extremely helpful. We visited in mid September 2010. My third trip to Rome and one of the best hotel stays I have experienced. Rome was the first stop of our Italy vacation and Hotel Canova set high standards for our hotel expecations! The customer service was amazing, and I've stayed in many 4-5 star resorts and they were good. Magdelena at the front answered any questions we asked from diing recommendations to questions about Italy. The rooms were very clean but most importantly, the air conditioner worked and was AMAZING.

Also, not many good restaurants within short walking distance (Within a 2 block radius) Really good for people who don't want to sacrifice clean room and good air conditioning for location. The good: the staff were very helpful, giving us maps, helping us book tickets to sights etc. The room was big enough and clean. The location was great -it was within walking distance to everything, but it was still on a relatively quiet street, so sleeping wasn't a problem. Breakfast was included in our stay, which consisted of cold meats, cheese, pastries, bread, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, coffee and juice. The bad: the shower's water pressure was terrible. Overall I would recommend the hotel though, and would stay here again myself.",,,
Fiver75,192078,"I actually really enjoyed the Wedgewood as an (almost) reasonable priced, affordable hotel in Central London. The location is great, not too far from the Bayswater Tube and with plenty of shops within a short walk. The hotel is located between two small parklands, so there is even a feeling of space around the place. Staff were decent Ã¢â¬â business-like but efficient. They could almost sell tickets to the scary elevator Ã¢â¬â very small, very old and quite rickety and bouncy! It seems to work fine, but I crossed my fingers every time I got into it, just in case! Well, itÃ¢â¬â¢s better than stairs... The building is quite old, so the floors squeak, and thin walls meant I could hear a little of my neighbours comings and goings, but it was not too bad. The flimsy-looking beds were not as uncomfortable as they look, so I got a good nightÃ¢â¬â¢s sleep. There was a desk, but it was too narrow to put anything wider than a coffee cup on. In what can only be described as an ingenious use of space, the bathroom and wardrobe could easily be mixed up, but most importantly everything was kept clean and functioned well. This hotel has just got the basics Ã¢â¬â no restaurant or anything else, but it is great for an affordable place that is not too far from the sights and sounds of Central London. Highly recommended! Ibis was reasonable, without being too great. The room was tiny, so much so that I had to leave my luggage sitting next to the bed (there was no wardrobe space). The room itself was very clean, but it was just SO tiny! Everything you would expect was jammed in there, though - TV, desk, fridge, kettle, etc... It was okay because I was on my own. The hotel is a little remote, but the MTR station is nearby, so it is not too bad. My room was on the south side, so there was no view to speak of - from memory you pay extra to get a room with a view. Ibis was okay, but I think you can get better value for money elsewhere. Fort Canning Lodge was a big hotel, with a huge reception area downstairs and comfortable, uncluttered rooms. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Just minutes from Orchard Road and the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and with Fort Canning Park opposite, the location is perfect. My room was very clean and included the basics you would expect - a stocked mini-bar, safe, tea/coffee etc.. Internal noise was a bit of a problem - I was woken by other guests leaving in the early morning, as the noise of door slamming and footsteps in the hall come right into the room. Up until that point, however, I'd had a good nights sleep. Given that this is Singapore, the price was reasonable for what I got. Good hotel, great location! They are not kidding when they say that the Bras Basah MRT station is just a minute away â from the exit walk straight ahead and the hotel is only 100 metres away. Orchard Road and all its wonderful shopping is only a 5-10 minute walk. So all in all, the location is very good. The reception area is full of desks rather than an actual counter. Check in was quick, but the staff could have actually talked a bit â there was a lot of paper rustling and checking on the computer before I was finally done â it was all business. My room was great â a nice view of Singapore, a modest size and quite clean. Unfortunately, as is the way in Singapore, the additional prices were ridiculous! The mini-bar sported: Pepsi cans at $5 each, beer cans at $8 each and water at $2.50 each!!! There was no wifi in the rooms, and while they did offer a free LAN cable, I was too scared to check the price. This is not really an issue with the Royal at Queens in specific â rather with hotels in Singapore in general, and one that I will harp about until it is resolved. It is 2011 people! They offer free wifi at Changi airport! You charge a decent amount for your hotel and offer so little for itâ¦ So other than that little rant, there were just one other little issue. The bath/shower combination was great, but the shower curtain was too close to the wall and it was impossible to shower without wearing it. All in all, not a bad option for central Singapore. Unfortunately the Royal At Queens Hotel is just like most other hotels in Singapore, presuming that because you are prepared to spend decent money for the hotel they can charge you ridiculous amounts for everything else - $8 for a beer; that is criminal, from a hotel that charges over $150 AUD per night! I donât expect it to change, but I donât have to like it, and itâs a big part of why I only ever stop over in Singapore, rather than consider it a tourist destination in itself. So the Royal At Queens Hotel; decent, but no more. Okay, depending on your point of view, the Chiswick Moran is either very, very retro cool, or very, very dated and daggy! Retro green dominates â I was a little undecided for a while, but I recon it makes a nice change from the norm. The Chiswick is a pretty good option in London â the Gunnersbury Tube Station was a short walk away, and buses run out the front of the hotel, so you are pretty well connected. Not sure about cars â I think there was on site car parking but I didnât use it so I am not sure... On the tube the Centre of London was only about 20 minutes away, so the hotel is not too remote. There is a nice large foyer with efficient, if a little impersonal, staff. My room was nice and big, lots of storage space and room to stretch out. There was a large work desk and internet is available, although at a ridiculous price! The room and bathroom were kept very clean and, despite a retro pattern actually seemed quite new and fresh. My room had a bath and shower â nice hot water! Altogether, a very comfortable room and a comfortable stay. Recommended! The Devere Hotel is very well located in Potts Point. It is literally just up the road from the infamous Ã¢â¬ÅKings Cross StripÃ¢â¬ï¿½ with all its associated craziness and colour. There is a supermarket across the street and more shops, cafes and restaurants within short walking distance than you can poke a stick at! The hotel has a large lobby area, and staff who are efficient and friendly. My room was reasonable, while showing signs of wear and tear. Overall, quite clean and comfortable. Decent sized room with a small kitchenette, wardrobe and a small but efficiently designed bathroom. An empty fridge lets you fill up with your choice of goods from the supermarket across the road, and there is a decent set of glasses and cups. The area can be quite Ã¢â¬ÅcolourfulÃ¢â¬ï¿½ at night, but guests are protected from the goings-on outside by a security door that is locked overnight Ã¢â¬â guestÃ¢â¬â¢s room keys get them in so no need to wait for staff. CCTV adds another level of protection. Having said that, the Devere is a few hundred metres up from the bars and clubs, but I did not see any undesirables hanging around near the hotel. WIFI is available in the lobby at the cheap price of $2 per half hour, or apparently in some of the newer rooms Ã¢â¬â ask for this if you want it when you book. The Devere is a great little hotel and my stay there was very comfortable. Recommended! I stayed at the Fragrance Hotel Ruby when transiting through Singapore. While it remains one of the only reasonably priced hotels in Singapore, you certainly get what you pay for. The Geylang area is bustling, with lots of great food to be found and people around at all hours, but the 24 hours hubbub out the window can be annoying - hope to get a room high up in the building. The rooms are very basic and very small. They are showing their age and look very heavily used. Bed sheets were stained, and I was glad I was only staying there one night. There was a kettle, cups and some complimentary water and coffee included though, which was nice. My window latch was broken, so I couldn't close it properly, which was an issue both for noise (overnight) and heat (during the day) as the old battle-axe of an air-conditioner could only do so much to cool the room. For a cheap bed to sleep for a night, Fragrance Ruby is okay, but any more than that it is not. Recommended, if only for the price. Dolphin Hotel seems to be like the others I have seen in Paddington â multi-storey, with small rooms that can barely contain a single bed, and a tiny ensuite. My room was cozy enough. They even managed to squeeze in a small desk. It seemed like my room was the result of a renovation, as the shower and wash basin were in the room, then the toilet was off to the side inside the door. The result was good for me, as there ended up being two doors between me and the hall, meaning there was virtually no noise from other guests. The real plus with the Dolphin Hotel was that there was a fridge in the room â only a small bar fridge, but a nice addition that I have not seen in other hotels. Especially during the summer months, this is a big plus in my book. This little difference really made this hotel for me. So, its small, and terribly overpriced for what it is, but this is central London. Paddington is a great place for tourists to base themselves, and the Dolphin was comfortable enough. A pretty good hotel and I would stay there again.","clean and decent room, good service, good breakfast, helpful reception, but no lift which can be a problem.

A pretty good hotel and I would stay there again. It's the worst hotel that I saw in my life. Carpet in room was compromised because of the smell which could not sleep. you can get sick in this hotel. Just a few minutes walk from Padington main line and underground stations, with plenty of bus routes in the area as well - location is excellent. Check in handled speedily and efficiently: on advising that I had to leave early in the morning there were apologies given for the fact that it would be before the continental breakfast was available. Room on ground floor, with small entrance lobby to the room with toilet and washbasin off. Room a bit on the small side but adequate: bed, table, chair, TV all provided, together with another washbasin and shower in one corner. Tea and coffee facilities available, plus - a bonus - extra pillows and blankets provided if necessary, something some larger hotels no longer seem to be able to supply! Periodic rumblings underneath from underground trains: if you were a light sleeper this would be disturbing, but it did not stop me getting off to sleep. We chose this hotel because it is close to the Subway and bus route plus we were able to park our rental car. We chose this hotel because it has a swimming pool for my boys plus it has a small kitchen, The dining room is great for evening meals. At nearly sixty quid, I thought my room in this hotel was something of a bargain. It's very central, which is what I wanted as I wanted to hang out in central London for the duration of my two day stay in the city. It's in a pleasant and reasonably quiet square in a busy area, so one can get an undisturbed night's sleep while just a short walk away there are plenty of cafes, pubs, restaurants, etc. A big plus: the tube station is very nearby. Another big plus: Paddington station, where there's the Heathrow Express, is very nearby. The room I had was small and the en-suit bathroom was ridiculously small, but I was able to sleep very well in the room, rest in it during the day, and shower despite the small size of the shower unit. My room had a balcony overlooking the square, which was very nice. I can't comment on the breakfast, since I didn't have it: I'm one for going to a local cafe for an English breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful enough. Another big plus: I had access to a safe deposit box at the reception, which was a great relief for me as I hate carrying my body belt with passport and what not in around town. Two words which came to mind soon after I'd gone up to my room after checking in: quaint and funky. As far as budget accomodation goes, this was a good hotel. The room was clean, for the most part it was reasonably quiet and its a few minutes walk from the Paddington tube station. I do think its important that people with any kind of back or leg issue understand that there is no lifts in this hotel (or in a lot of the hotels in this budget block area). I had to drag my heavy suitcases up 3 flights of stairs on a narrow staircase which was not fun. However staff were friendly and for the most part this is a good hotel. If you want to stay in an economy hotel in Central London, I recommend the Dolphin. I also stayed in the shakespeare hotel because my flight was cancelled and the staff went out of their way to help me rebook. They were caling the airline for 2 days until I finally secured a seat back home. Excellent location close to tourist attractions in and around London, superb value for being in the heart of London, The receptionists were very helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and helped arrange many of the tickets for tours and attraction. and to start each day we were served a great breakfast. A definite recommend for those on a budget. Nice and clean hotel with a good location next to Paddington station, and a 15 minutes walk to Oxford street. The room was nice, and small. The hotel was fully booked when we stayed there, so we had to wait in line to have breakfast every morning, since the breakfast room was way to small to fit everyone. Not a top rating, but you get what you pay for. A nice and practical located hotel. Stayed here with a friend and her 2 children in a quad room for one night. All we needed was a room for the night. Great location minutes from Paddington Station. The room appeared clean. The en-suite was tiny but I was expecting that for a B & B in London. The room was very hot and the window wouldn't stay open so we had to prop it open which wasn't ideal. We only stayed one night and forgot to report it so I can't say if they would have fixed it or not. The breakfast room was small we had to wait and then split our group and share with others but the breakfast was good. Continental included in the price a choice of toast, cereal and fruit. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you plan to spend a lot of time in the there but if all you are after is a bed for the night, a shower and breakfast on a budget then it's ideal. I would stay there again. The Hotel was the cheapest I could find at ÃÂ£90, which I suppose at the last minute is cheap for London. Now my review is based on the fact that it is a budget hotel and doesn't pretend to be a 5* palace. The room was clean and tidy, location excellent - 2 minutes walk from Paddington tube station. The bathroom was very small and basic, it reminded me of a portaloo, plastic walls, sinks etc. But it was clean and plenty of hot water at 07:30 in the morning. Surprisingly there was a fridge and hair dryer in the room. I did not try breakfast. Overall if you want a convenient location, somewhere to put your head now then this is the hotel for you! Stayed at The Dolphin for two nights at the end of July 2010, I booked this hotel because of it's good location and wasn't disappointed. Paddington Tube is a two minute stroll from the hotel and there are lots of facilities in the local vicinity, nice coffe shop a few pubs and restaurants. We booked a double en-suite but were allocated a triple, the beds were actually tiny and the matresses a bit on the lumpy side but in general the room was clean and bright and had lots of electric sockets for charging cameras / phones etc. There was a hairdryer in the room as well as a fridge and kettle with tea / coffee etc. The Hotel looks out onto a lovely garden area and the street is fairly quiet so no problems with traffic noise. Didn't have the breakfast so unable to comment on how good / bad this is but we did make use of the facility to store our bags FOC after we checked out. Staff all seemed to be friendly and helpful. If you want a place to crash in London, close to amenities and the all important Tube Station with no frills and a good price you really can't go wrong with The Dolphin. After escaping the Ascot Hyde Park Hotel we found The Dolphin. What a relief! While Ascot Hyde PArk was a real dump THe Dolphin turned out to be a nice, clean and pleasant place to stay. The room (family - five beds) was large and was cleaned with new towels every day. Full english breakfast included in the 130 pounds we paid per night. We are returning to this hotel I spent three days last week in London. This place has a huge + : it is located in 3 minutes walk from the Heathrow express terminal. Staff was helpfull and friendly. Rooms a bit small but clean with individual bathroom. I definetely recomand it to someone who needs a centrall located B+B in London. My stay at the Dolphin Hotel was just perfect. I liked the atmosphere, the staff were very kind and helpful, the room impeccably clean with comfortable mattress and warm white duvet. The decoration, with old paintings and a sort of old chimney in my room, warm and welcoming. The view on the square on the sunny day was nice. Bathroom spotless. It was quiet during the night and very pleasant. It is also very well located. I highly recommend it.",,,
Luckybas,618551,"Spent five nights. Clean quite rooms. Breakfast average and expensive. Newspaper took three days to arrive. Expensive Internet. Helpful reception people. Location in Rigga st good in city center. Dirty rooms, lobby with photos of girl dancers. Smell is bad. Room is filthy. Furniture looks old. I had to cancel the reservation and run with my kids.","Ramee Guestline is a Hotel in Deira with a good location but nothing else to recommend. With loud Music playing out at night ( 3 night clubs !!!) , shady ""nightlife "" activities , bad room service and NO soundproofing this place is a complete nightmare for a business traveller. Highlights of this sleaze bag of an hotel were an Unfriendly staff that insisted on retaining passport ( since I booked thru a web portal - but had guranteed thru a amex card ) , Staff that would ask me to make partial payments since the payable has extended 500 AED , Room service that insisted on cash against delivery & had to be told the same order thrice . Horror of horrors , someone enetered my room thru a side door at 130 AM in the night !!!!!!!!!! The staff looked numbed to such minor inconveniences faced by the guests. I suggest please avoid this place. I stayed 3 nights there alone. Pros: + good location, a lot of restaurant around. AL-ghurair in near. + rooms are clean. Cons: - too laud noise of night club that u cannot sleep until 3am. - breakfast is ordinary. - staff aren't pleasant. - lobby is not a nice place to sit rest. - bathroom is not completely clean. - you can hear another room voices clearly !! The location of the hotel was perfect, and the charges of the hotel for average night was very affordable. food joints and malls were very nearby. Metro station was even close so the traveling became easy. Rooms were clean and very specious. Overall the experience was good but the pub and club thing was not very acceptable since it made too much of noise. i reckon good hotel, took care of us welll!! i would say its in one of the best location everr to say, only thing abit slow in room service overall had an enjoyable stay there Location in Rigga st good in city center. Dirty rooms, lobby with photos of girl dancers. Smell is bad. Room is filthy. Furniture looks old. I had to cancel the reservation and run with my kids.",,,
SightsAndSoul,483508,"I stayed at the Miami Airport International Hotel in Jan 2009 and in Jan 2010, and find it comfortable and convenient. The cost of the hotel is related to its location, not standard. The bathrooms are modern, the rooms small but quiet and comfortable, the beds are super comfortable and the wooden shutters block any undesireable view that they may overlook. The avvertised Wi-Fi did not work and the restaurant on the 7th floor is overpriced, but still a better option than fast food joints in the terminal. I stayed in Dragomanni in October 2010, with a small group of women. The hotel's main attribute is it's location, near the Grand Canal, off Campo Santo Stefano, but hidden on a charismatic side street. Despite the claims on its website it is NOT ON the Grand Canal. You can see the Grand Canal from one of the top floor rooms, but it is a superior room and costs extra. People in my group had nice rooms, but mine was a handicapped room, and rather akward for someone who doesn't need it, especially the bathroom. The breakfast was really nice, especially for Italy where it is usually minimal. We had some going back and forth with the management regarding the final price of the rooms which ended up costing more than the original price. The front desk staff was pleasant, and the maids were doing a good job. I am not going to bring my clients there again this fall because I didn't like the way my guests were treated, but if you don't mind that, the hotel itself is fine. The hotel, or rather a motel type property, is close to Ciampino airport and they have a shuttle to get you there which costs 8 Euro per person. We took a train from central Rome and were told to call them on arrival for pick-up. And indeed, their shuttle soon arrived, and there was no charge for getting us TO the the hotel. However, once there, you need to pay 8 Euro to get anywhere, so we felt a somewhat trapped, especially since the property is isolated with nothing in the walking distance. It does an adequate job of an airport hotel, just make sure that once you get here you don't need/want to go anywhere else. There is a full service restaurant with mediocre food and service, but the wine they serve was the worst I ever had anywhere. The room was clean and inexpensively furnished, but had everything we needed. They start serving breakfast at 7, and if you need to leave early for your flight, there is no coffee service before then. There was Wi-Fi Internet which worked in some parts of the hotel, not in the rooms, but for us it was too expensive to be worth it.","Despite the name, if you conceptualize this establishment as a ""hotel"", you are setting yourself up for diappointment. Think rooms more on par with EconoLodge or Motel 8. I checked in to a room with cheap, 20-year-old looking, K-Mart-like furnishings (i.e., pressed plywood closets and desk). Although there was nothing overtly unclean in the room, it just didn't have that feel or look of being sanitary. I actually had to be switched to a different room because my heating system was not in working order...I should have dealt with the cold because I was moved to a room that wreaked of mold. The hotel staff told me that there were no other rooms available. So, I had to endure stench that filled the entire room. The bathroom walls were cracked, had holes in them. I actually showered with my cloth slippers on because I didn't know what I might contract from stepping on the shower floor with my bare foot. Oh, and speaking of shower, the shower ""wall"", which was a flimsy piece of think plastic, fell apart from the pressure of the showerhead's water hitting it. There are some positives - proximity to the Ciampino airport and restaurant on site that serves descent food. If you only have 1 night in Rome and need to stay near the airport, then take your chances here. If you have a longer stay, however, I would suggest staying in the city. You'll find much better accomodations for similar rates. There is no direct public transportation from the airport to the city and cabs are very expensive. But, you can take the SIT bus from Rome directly to the airport for 6 Euro and it runs every 30 minutes. You can also take the subway to the Anangnina stop (last stop on the red line) and then cab it to the airport which is 4 KM from the metro stop. I stayed here with friends the night before our flight back home from Rome. Our room was very big but very basic too but we were not expecting too much anyway. Reception staff were nice and helpful. The hotel is very close to the airport but there is nothing else around the area and it is about 45 minutes from Rome. There was a shuttle bus to the airport that cost â¬2.50 per person which isn't expensive but we thought the hotel should have offered this free to people however that is just a personal opinion. We stayed the night before getting a flight home after a week on the Amalfi Coast. It was what i expected - a basic hotel near the an Airport. It was clean. The A/C was noisy. The shower base didn't drain so length of shower was how full the base got before spilling out. We had a evening meal which was very good, more than some eaten elsewhere. The breakfast was also very good which had a large selection including fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, fresh croissants including one with custard inside - Hmm! I stayed here for about the fourth or fifth time and the room was spotless and very large. The hotel is perfect for an early morning flight as it is a 5 minute drive. The food & restaurant service was not as good as usual this time but there were a couple of large tour groups. Hopefully this was a one off, I will definitely stay here again The hotel, or rather a motel type property, is close to Ciampino airport and they have a shuttle to get you there which costs 8 Euro per person.

GAguaLover,80067,"The staff, particularly Rocky and Diane, were very pleasant and helpful during our 3 week stay in January 2012. Rooms were nicely maintained by the cleaning staff.

Cooked items weren't kept warm and the coffee was pretty bad...however it was complimentary. All the employees at this Quality Inn were extremely friendly and helpful to my family and me. I stayed at this same hotel the only other time I was in San Diego. It is easy to get to and close to MCAS Miramar. I will definitely stay the next visit to San Diego. The room and bed and ambiance were very nice and comfortable. The mattress was new and very relaxing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I especially enjoyed the complementary breakfast which was 4 stars itself. The price was very modest. Free Wi-fi in the room too. Across the street is a big Holiday Inn. Checking in and out with the friendly staff was quick and easy. Though I skipped it I was informed of a free breakfast buffet from 6am to 9am in the morning. Getting to my room involved walking up three flights of stairs (no elevator located in the hotel) and I was initially concerned as the lobby, stairs and hallways smelled of cigarette smoke. Upon entering my room I was pleased to find that it smelled normal and there was no trace of smoke. The bed was amazingly comfortable (they added an aftermarket pillow top cover) and the three pillows per bed were also quite comfy. The hotel provided free Wi-Fi and satellite TV with many channels. The bathroom was normal with the average soaps and shampoos provided though I used my own. The only caution would be the surface of the bathtub/shower was slippery and I almost fell once. There are no bars or surface features to catch yourself should you slip. All in all for the price I was impressed. I had a good nights sleep in my quiet room and I would stay again. I had 3 day""s to prepare for a trip from Alabama(my home of 12 years) to my home state of California. Everything about the trip was on the fly... Through a random set of circumstances I ended up in Mira Mesa, It was late and I decided to stay near S.D. airport, instead of with the Family in Huntington beach, putting me 1 1/2 hours closer to my end destination. Once again, I luck up on a great deal. The room at the Quality Inn was cleaner than my suite at Hyatt place the previous week and $30 cheaper. The cleaning crew does what they are paid to do,they make it clean! They don't just make it look nice, right down to the dusting. Most people don't pay attention the details, Good Job Ladies! A good sized room, w/ VERY COMFORTABLE King bed and a large desk for a workplace. Also a smaller round glass table w/ 2 Fat chairs`and an television in its entertainment center. Plenty of storage space for the traveler, (i.e Closet, Drawers, and Shelves.) Everything was well placed, very effective use of space, well thought out or they just got lucky... Also the location, right off the 15 freeway, was perfect! $1.50 washed and dried a load of clothes, detergent is $1 at the front desk. The staff, Professional and friendly, just like Mr. Rocky E. Mountain. Please show this to your staff, sir. They should know their hard work was noticed and appreciated. Thank You. Jeff Scott Becker Native Southern Californian who ended up home for his 43 birthday! I stayed at the Quality Inn from September 5 till October 1, 2011. The front desk staff were very friendly from the beginniing of my stay. They are the type of staff that would give their shirt off their back for you! I was there when we had the black out - a lot of the guest came together with the staff and helped each other out by the pool. It is like a big family. They made my stay very pleasant. They were very personable and wanted to know daily how your day went. They took that extra minute in their day when they may have had other things to do like get someone to the airport, or get a guest that extra blanket or advise you were to go for good food! We only stayed one night, but the value and location were perfect for us. The front desk staff (RM) was the best, very personable and helpful and a asset to Quality Inn. The room had wifi, refrig, microwafe,and in room coffee. Not sure if all of the rooms had the same ammenities as we had a corner room. Rooms were clean, beds and linens were great. We would deffinatley recommend this Quality Inn.",,,
sanchezvilleda,91813,The staff here was great! They were very helpful and accommodating. Roger checked me in and made everything easy with his great attitude. Thanks! The staff here was great! They were very helpful and accommodating. Roger checked me in and made everything easy with his great attitude. Thanks!,"Some things I really like were things such as Linda and her great staff. They are the most helpful and considerate that I have experienced in years. Every single one of them have a great smile and great attitude to go with that smile, even when dealing with unpleasant customers who think they are staying at the Hilton. Next is the room size. All of these are two-room suites! That means they are virtually a mini-apartment with a small, but full, bathroom and they same with n they kitchen.If you need a reasonably priced extended stay facility for business or whatever, this is the best deal in town. If you or your company plan on needing housing for at least three months be sure to ask about the LTL (Long-term lease) plan, it will save you a fortune. The staff here was great! They were very helpful and accommodating. Roger checked me in and made everything easy with his great attitude. Thanks! ive been a guest at extended stay for over 3 years and i must say that the staff here has been very helpful to me. im an elderly man whos needed a little bit of help from time to time and i couldnt be more grateful to be surrounded by such a helpful staff. Manager Linda and rest of the staff, from receptionists to maintenace, are amazingly friendly and helpful..Being staying here for last 10 years off and on...Few minutes from las vegas strip...I highly recommend it... Unbelievable to find this place. Great price - super clean - so close to the strip and a very nice staff. You can't find this kind of deal in Vegas - full kitchen, living room, two TV's. My my!! I'll be back and I will tell all my friends about it. Just down the road from Rio and Bellagio is in back of it. I travel for business a lot.....and I do mean A LOT. And I have certainly stayed in my share of hotels, expensive and less expensive, good and bad. But this place is definitely in my BOTTOM 2! I guess it would be fine if you're a smoker and don't mind the fact that the carpeting, the drapes, the towels, the furniture and the bedding all smell like an ashtray or that in order to even come close to not breathing the foul smell all night you have to sleep with your head under the sheets. But, I'm sorry, for me this was the WORST. Waking up coughing 5 times throughout what seemed like an endless night and waking up with beet-red eyes are not my idea of a good hotel stay. Aside from the smoke, I also found cigarette holes in the bedspread, rips in the sheet, they don't supply you with hangers, dishwashing liquid, or paper towels, eventhough this is meant to be somewhere you can call your home away from home and I don't want to even imagine what the brown gooey substance on the inside of the windows was! In general, while things looked clean overall, the whole place just FEELS DIRTY! By the way, when I first checked into the room and then asked if they had non-smoking rooms, I was told that they do, but they were all booked up until the end of the month. In the end, I just wanted to GET OUT OF THERE! Well, once again, I checked into this place with great trepidation due to previous reviewers. We arrived late on Thursday, but the young lady in the office was very friendly, and took great care of the five of us that were checking in. We were missing a remote control for the TV an she got us one right away. I go to my room and my roommate goes to turn down the covers on his bed and finds hairs. So I check my bed...same thing...so that's a little disconcerting. We were tired and had to be at work the next day so we put the bed spreads back up and slept on top of that for the evening. So when we get back from work, I go to the office to get clean bed linens, and the young man in the office couldn't have apologized more. Other than that...the room was actually pretty nice. Bath tub needed to be reglazed, and there were some stains at the top of the tile in the tub area, but the room was clean, and once we got the clean sheets on the bed, they were comfortable enough...This particular ESH actually has a living room/kitchen combo, then the bedroom is actually another room... Four burner stove top, full size refrigerator/freezer, microwave. You could walk to Palms and Gold Coast...the Strip is right across the interstate...so plenty of entertainment in the area... Now the hair on the bed was bad, but there is also one member of the staff who really needs to go away...younger guy who looks like he might sleep in his uniform, but he is rude and pretty damn obnoxious....everyone else was plenty friendly, but it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for every one... I'd still go back, and recommend the place.",,,
Tatiana2011,89326,"My husband and I had a wedding to go to in Baltimore and we chose this hotel because of the location and outstanding price. When we arrived we were so impressed by the beautiful exterior. Upon entering we started to become skeptical. There were babies screaming upstairs and very odd people just hanging out in the lobby. I started to feel as if perhaps these people were living here. We went up to our room which was giant. It was time for my shower so I headed to the bathroom and was totally disgusted. I mean it was probably the grossest bathroom I have ever been in. I was very careful not to let my body touch any part of the shower. In general I was very creeped out and had nightmares all night b/c I was afraid we would get robbed. It's not a fact but I am almost positive that at least 2 families were living in the rooms next to us. The walls are paper thin and we heard everything. I would not call myself a neat freak and can handle a certain degree of uncleanliness but this was beyond what I would deem appropriate hotel accommodations. I have been in hostels that were far better than this! My husband and I went to NYC this weekend to be full on tourists. We stayed at the Paramount which was the perfect choice. The location couldn't have been better. Half a block away from the heart of Times Square. Block away from the Imperial Theater where we saw Billy Elliot and enjoyed a pre-show meal at Sardi's. We arrived at the Paramount at noon on Friday and got a room right away. This room had view of the wall of the next building so we asked to get a room with a view. It wasn't available until after 3 so we checked our bags and went visiting with friends until check-in. The room was exactly what we wanted! Much bigger than the first although still small, which was to be expected. VERY comfortable bed! Cool room. Friendly staff. Perfect location. Great price.

The location was perfect for my trips to the Walters Art Museum and the free ""Charm City Circulator"" bus makes it very convenient to anywhere in the city. I felt perfectly safe in the neighborhood and left my car 2 blocks away at the Maryland General Hospital ($9 total parking cost for a 3-day stay). The Mount Vernon neighborhood is filled with lovely old buildings and I felt quite safe as a woman walking alone. My room (211) was a delightful surprise. Yes, it was up 41 steps, but it had an enormous sitting room as well as a large bedroom. The furniture was a wonderfully eclectic mix of antiques from all periods and the bed was quite comfortable. Yes, it could use a face lift, but it was very clean and comfortable. The microwave, coffee maker and mini-refrigerator all worked perfectly. There were plenty of drawers and closet space to store a month's worth of stuff. There were also plenty of lights and electrical outlets. I liked the decor and the artwork. My favorite was the antique sewing machine in the corner. I loved the view of the church spire out the sitting room window. The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the silk flowers, which looked a bit tired and dusty. The woman at the front desk was helpful and friendly. The bathroom was in need of work. There had been water damage on the ceiling which was warped and discolored and the handle on the tub was loose. However, it was clean and how much time do you spend in the bathroom anyway? Overall, I would recommend this place highly to anyone who is willing to accept some minor imperfections in exchange for a comfortable and memorable experience. I am from the area and that was the worse experience of my life. It looked like the Adams Family house, the ceiling was peeling, mold around the shower and an actual cat walking around. I thought it would be shabby chic but i honestly felt as though norman bates was going to stab me in the shower. Do not I repeat don not stay there even though the price is alluring I couldnt do it. I actually left the hotel and got a refund GREAT LOCATION...close to both free bus and lite rail.room had everything needed micro fridge and 1 burner. mt vernon area which is old and very historic.could use a MAJOR update but served the purpose. shower and sleep. not the ritz but not the ritz prices either.would stay again. Being a frequent traveler to Europe, this hotel made me homesick for the quaint, bed and breakfast-like hotels in London. Although, this place seriously needs an elevator, it was an amazing, historical journey back to the Victorian 1800's in the heart of Mt. Vernon, Baltimore. Yes, this place is homely, but there are so many things to see and touch and has a museum-like quality. The lobby is an wonderful place to have coffee/tea and relax. Mr. Patel, the owner, was a joy to work with and very responsive to our needs. The bedroom suites were like real parlors and bedroom combinations. I found myself wanting to see each room out of curiosity as they were all decorated differently. If you can get the Biltmore Suite, Room 101, ask for it! The location is perfect and in close proximity to food, coffee shops, theaters, natural food stores, ethnic food places, bars, and museums. Hop on the Charm City Connector (free) and tour the city. Parking at the hotel is only available on the street and it can be hard to find a space at night since residents have priority, but if you find a space, stay in it and walk around. (Read the meters!) Look, if you are looking for a modern, sleek hotel (and one with an elevator), then avoid this hotel. You will look immediately to the cracks in the walls and the lived-in furniture. But if you are looking for a place that has a bit of Baltimore's historical charm, has a friendly approachable staff, and has a warm, shabby-ish decor, themed rooms, then this place is a gem! This House ist unbelievable dirty and run down. No Elevator. The bedsheets had not been changed for some time. Dust everywhere. Wallpaper hanging down.

I would not call myself a neat freak and can handle a certain degree of uncleanliness but this was beyond what I would deem appropriate hotel accommodations. I have been in hostels that were far better than this! I booked this room online because it was the cheapest place in town and there was a convention in town that week. I was a little weary because I had read some reviews about it being in a bad part of town. I was very pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the actual hotel. It was an old beautiful building that I later found out was over a hundred years old and used to be a boarding house an a dormitory among other things. The staff was very helpful and kind. We booked a smoking room and were given a non-smoking, but were given a new room as soon as the clerk was informed of the mistake. Each room was unique and included a small kitchenette with a fridge and stove top. The rooms were old fashioned looking and had old fixtures in the bath but all was very clean. The section of town it was in was not as bad as I anticipated and we were directed to park in a parking garage about a half a block over. The clerk was extremely friendly and talked to us an answered questions for about an hour. He directed us two blocks over, which is really the heart of the city. I know that people usually want to do touristy things in the harbor, but the Biltmore is for those who like to explore the real Baltimore. There were lots of little local stores, art galleries and cool shops. There are no elevators in the Biltmore but that was not a discouragement for me at all. The building is unbelievable lovely. The rooms are nice and homey. It is a lot more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel. I really am hard pressed to believe the bad reviews on here. I absolutely adored the place. The common room had sofas and a bookcase and even a cat! We were traveling on a small budget and the night clerk allowed us to used the microwave in the downstairs kitchen to prepare our meals. I am planning a trip to Baltimore specifically to stay there again. I read all of the reviews that were on here before I booked a stay. At first alittle discourage but I went with my gut feeling and booked a stay anyway. And glad I did the attendance were awesome. The room was beautiful Living room, kitchen, dining area, Im from baltimore and i stayed at some horrible places that was suppose to be nice but the Biltmore Stood past its expectations to me and my wife. when we visit baltimore again I know where we staying.. BILTIMORE BABY..... I almost hesitate to spill this secret...I needed to go to Johns Hopkins and my budget dictated this or the ""seen 'em all"" Microtel. Glad I ventured off the beaten path! Locted in the Mt. Vernon cultural district, this is the real deal, a once grand, now good, all suites hotel, with a salon so large you could have a party or sleep a girl scout troop in there. Biltmore bows deeply to its Victorian past in decor. Woodwork is in 1870s Stick-Eastlake style, both in the ornate banister we caressed as we climbed the twisting staircase and in the two fireplaces in our suite. Sure, the furniture was a bit scuffed, but for $80 a night, microfridge, coffeemaker, ample towels, completely comfortable. My only regret was I couldn't live here a week. Next time I'll bring my own hairdryer and drive past the hotel to the hospital parking garage in the next block for their co-op parking at $3 with validation. Before I booked the room at this place, I saw all these reviews here, and was making me double guess whether I should stay here or not; I took the chance. You pay for what you get, I donât really have any complaints other than there being no elevator. The bathrooms were clean, the rooms were descent, good customer service. The Hotel is in a really good spot, close to the Inner Harbor (about a mile away), and close to downtown. I had a good experience, will totally stay again if visiting Baltimore some time again in the future.",,,
FrancescoR,1159908,"This hotel is a 2-star so I didn't expect any luxury.

I recommend this hotel for short stays like stop-overs if you don't want to spend too much. Geylang is the so-called ""red light district"" but I wasn't disturbed at all. I've been in this hotel for three nights during a short trip as tourist in the city. I was traveling alone so I booked a single room. The position is very good not very far from the center even if the MRT station is quite far away. Rooms are confortable and clean, even if very small. But considering the normal prices for 3-star hotels in Singapore, they are good enough. There is a flatscreen tv but just with local channels. Internet wifi was available for free, but during my stay was very slow and sometimes it didn't work at all. Breakfast was not provided during my stay. Anyway, Aqueen is a good hotel that I can recommend to everyone that is not disturbed by very small rooms.","This hotel is a 2-star so I didn't expect any luxury.

I recommend this hotel for short stays like stop-overs if you don't want to spend too much. Geylang is the so-called ""red light district"" but I wasn't disturbed at all. We Check in late (20.00). The receptionist was very nice and helpful. Room a little bit small but enough for us because we didn't bring large baggage. At the end don't expect too much. It's a tour hotel but two nights stay nothing ill manner happened. Quiet and peaceful. Besides the eateries corner nearby are selling cheap. Located in Geylang, near the Aljunied rail station, which in turn is between downtown Singapore and Changi Airport, the Santa Grand is outside the zone of skyscraper hotels to be found in much of Singapore. Accommodation in Geylang is much less costly, and, despite the name of the hotel, much less opulent and over-the-top. The Santa Grand has clean rooms with adequate space, a comfortable bed, and very good shower. The air-conditioning is efficient, without being aggressively cold. The reception staff are very helpful and obliging. No breakfast is available at the hotel. but a couple of 7-11 stores are nearby, as well as a large food court, and for later in the day, some fine restaurants but a few minutes away. A kettle, plus tea/coffee, are provided in the room. i reach in singapore early morning about 10am , when i reach hotel request for early check-in , the staff is very not helpful and not polite , and direct reject my request . reason being is not enough staff to clear the room , and i asked for a bit early check in about 12pm , also cant get it , the staff not polite ask me come back after 2pm . and i asked for leave luggage at the hotel , the staff just point the store room ask me put myself at there . location wise is ok , not really convi , its about 15mins away from MRT station . Room is not clean , a bit dirty , room is smelly , toilet is very dirty . not recommend to stay . booked through an agent, this hotel was perfect for what we needed. Great location ( red light district is hardly noticed), only 10 mins from MRT statiion. Room was cozy but clean and had everything you needed including BBC News and a film channel! I would use again for 1-2 night stays in Singapore! Allowed us to store bags which was really useful and also reception staff helped answer questions. Free Wifi a big plus! I checked in late(2am) with no problem. This was my second stay at this hotel and probably my 10th time staying in the Geylang district. Singapore can be very expensive, so I stay in Geylang on a budget, while waiting for connecting flights. The other hotels in the area are dirty, noisy and constant targets of the immigration police raids, due to the short-time room rentals(Red-light district). Pros: The Santa Grand is very quiet, with a convenient location. Area is safe. The MRT station is about a 5 minute walk. There are a wide variety of restaurants and food stalls with fair prices here. The bed is hard, but that is how I like it. Hot pot for coffee and small fridge provided. Small flat screen TV good. Cons: The room is a bit small and there is no personal lockbox/safe for your valubles. I stayed for 3 nights at Santa Grand Aljunied: the hotel is in Geylang, one of Singapore ""red-light"" district. Notwithstanding this, the area is absolutely safe, quiet and full of nice restaurants, some of which are open all night long. Though the area is a bit out of the city centre, you can easily reach any place by underground, the MRT station being just a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The room I stayed in (standard) was quite small with a french bed (beware:hard mattress! but I slept well anyway), a fridge, tv set, aircon and free wireless. Cons: a bit noisy due to road traffic, and no safe deposit either in room nor at reception. This hotel was evidently refurbished from an earlier old dilapidated establishment. As a result some parts are new and modern while others show its history. For example the room was very modern and nicely furnished, but the bathroom was very ugly and old. This is an economy hotel with very small but adequate rooms. Staff are helpful but English is poor. For some reason I could not access the free wifi -- works in other hotels. The location must be the worst aspect. It is quite a long walk from the nearest MRT station and that dirty part of town is highly unattractive and full of migrant labourers. We booked this hotel for four nights at SGD 85/night, and well, you get what you pay for, and in Singapore this doesn't get you much at all. At least not when the hotel bookings are tight and there are no ""deals"" to be found. Its not in a nice neighborhood, not really close to much (although the metro stop is walking distance), and abuts a very noisy four-lane street. But the room... ugh! It reeked of clinging smoke, all of the furniture was falling apart and cheap and the bed was lumpy. But real the clincher was the cigarette burn holes in the bottom of the (plastic) tub/shower. I could imagine a family of five in the tiny room, with chain-smoking dad sleeping in the tub, abandoned cigarettes slowly burning down to the filters. We ate our first-night deposit and fled to a significantly more expensive place (220 SGD). Sometimes you just have to suck it up and pay the price. To be fair, if we absolutely had to stay on budget, this might have been the best we could find, a truly depressing thought.",,,
ajcloward,123029,"One would think that a Motel 6 near the airport would be for guests who have missed a flight or are connecting somehow. This did not appear to be the case. All night long there were people coming and going. The couple next to us were fighting and screaming at each other (which I suppose could have been a traveling couple). The most annoying was someone with a loud muffler on his truck and he would just sit in the parking lot and rev his engine over and over and then he'd tear out of the lot. About 1/2 hour later he'd tear back into the parking lot and rev his engine some more, go back inside and the the whole process would repeat itself over and over till about 6am when it finally stopped. The front wall (with the window and door) of the room felt like it was being held on with masking tape because we could hear everything that was going on outside. Every drunk person throwing up, every drunk couple stumbling up the stairs, everything! The rooms themselves were standard Motel 6 fare (retro blue/yellow/red bedspread) and an old TV. We tried to plug in our cell phones and lap top in the only outlet in the bedroom area and the wall plate fell off the wall with plaster crumbling to the floor. The only time I would recommend this place is for an emergency situation and you have nowhere else to go or you are on such a tight budget that the things I mentioned above don't really matter to you. This place saved me from a horrible experience at a hostel. I only stayed there one night and had to get out, and found this hotel on priceline. Although using such sites won't guarantee you this location. I was amazed that it was actually CHEAPER than a private room at the hostel. After staying at the disgusting hostel, walking into the Courtyard felt like a palace! I gasped when I opened my room and saw how enormous it was and absolutely beautifully decorated. Fully stocked ""mini store"" in the lobby that could have almost anything you would ever need at all hours. Reasonably priced adult beverages at the Bistro as well. I was also shocked that the internet was both wired and wireless (your choice) and it was free. Not many hotels of this caliber offer free internet. I highly recommend this place, especially for travelers. Rent a car and then stay here no matter where your vacation or business takes you into the LA area. When you're ready to fly back home, you're within less than 5 minutes from the airport...and as busy as LAX is, you need to be there AT LEAST 2 hours before your departure. Being so close will give you extra sleep on the amazingly comfortable beds. This is my new regular hotel for every future visit to LA. The rooms were quite large and very comfortable. I had a view of the stratosphere and even on the 8th floor, the view was awesome. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were very quiet. Unfortunately internet access is a whopping $14 a day! I was taking online courses at the time, so I had no choice, but this is outrageous when other hotels offer it for free. The other pain is parking. If you self-park, you while walk FOREVER to get back inside the building and then another FOREVER to make it to your room. Not a place you'll want to stay if you will be doing a lot of ""coming and going"". All of the Star Trek stuff has gone away, but a lot of the structures still remain which kind of seem out of place in some areas. This is definitely a place to stay if you want somewhere off the strip (maybe a good spot for families). The rooms were quite large and very comfortable.

The biggest shortcomings would be the limited number of towels and pillows provided and the ancient TV. The big plus other than price is the epic water pressure in the shower. Location is just a few exits from Seattle, which works well if youÃ¢â¬â¢re driving but if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have a car donÃ¢â¬â¢t even bother considering this location. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s nothing really in the area and itÃ¢â¬â¢s not the easiest place to find but if youÃ¢â¬â¢re just passing through on a road trip or just donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to pay hotel prices in Seattle this is a pretty good place. IÃ¢â¬â¢ll probably return if IÃ¢â¬â¢m in the area and looking to save a bit of money.",,,
SarahMckSingapore,1235790,"I visited New York for the first time on business and stayed at the Millenium. It was incredibly convenient for me in terms of location and everything about the experience was ... ok. I arrived in advance of my trip and paid for one night myself and as I am travelling from Asia-Pacific, I found the price very high for what the place offered - I've no doubt this was in keeping with normal New York prices. The location of the hotel is great and is right next to a subway station, which is excellent news for amateurs like me. I had read reviews that said that the noise from the 9/11 memorial being built next door was intrusive and luckily I had a room on the 29th floor, so this was not an issue for me. The hotel is older and obviously a classic from it's time, but it's looking a little dated now and the rooms are incredibly small - again, this is likely in keeping with most of New York. As with most US establishments, the staff were adequate, but wanted a tip for simply performing their job. I don't mind tipping the guy who lugs your cases up to your room and gives you an overview of the hotel and surroundings, but I do resent the long face when you don't hand over a couple of dollars to the guy who opens the door. However, for the most part, the staff were friendly and polite - especially the Concierge desk. The food was fine and the selection pretty good. Overall I was not unhappy with my stay in New York, but it doesn't really compare in terms of value for other places. It is a wonderful town though and the 9/11 memorial next door was amazing.

Last time I stayed in Hong Kong it was a less than pleasurable experience, but my 3 day business trip at the Marriott was the exact opposite. I felt welcome from the moment of my arrival, unfortunately close to midnight on a rainy Sunday. The staff were polite, professional and attentive. In addition to checking me in, the young man on the desk signed me up to the loyalty program and took me to the lift and selected my floor. My bags arrived mere moments later and this was quickly followed by some complimentary Chinese tea and fruit; the tea was a lovely antidote to the trip. Every interaction from then on was spot on, right up to the moment of checking out, when the front desk person genuinely enquired whether I enjoyed my stay. The answer was an emphatic yes. I only ate breakfast at the hotel and it was lovely. I didn't use any other services, but the rooms were spacious and very well appointed. The amenities were great and I made good use of the free WiFi. The hotel is in a great office / shopping complex and well serviced by taxis. It's is a relatively short cab ride to the international check-in at IFC/Central and close to Admiralty MTR. I hope to return soon. We stayed at the Fraser Suites in Wan Chai for 2 weeks after relocating to Hong Kong. We have had a few different hotel experiences in Hong Kong and this was an easy to stay place in a good location. Regardless of how good the hotel, I get sick of not being able to do the things I would at home and a serviced apartment gives you the best of both worlds. The apartment is very small but well laid out with a separate kitchen, bathroom, sitting room and bedroom. Some of the extras like a medicine cabinet in the bathroom made life a lot easier in a small space. You can do your own cooking and washing, watch one of two televisions or go out into busy Wan Chai and check out the vibrant night life and restaurants. The property seems fairly new and everything was clean and in good shape - fittings were quite stylish. There were a few minor hitches that were annoying and hard to fix; the WiFi in the room was down constantly and the helpful staff installed a router in our room to boost the signal, but it took several tries with the staff to get it up and running. I struggled to have a decent shower when I was there (this is a pet peeve of mine) and I was either freezing or burning myself as the waster temperature went up and down. The air con has two fans, one in the main area and the bedroom, but it's pointed directly down at the bed and could only be switched on for minutes at a time or you would freeze - frustrating in hot weather to get the temp right and made for warm, sticky nights. Free breakfast was provided in the downstairs reception each week day, although I did not partake. There was always someone at reception and they were friendly and responsive with requests. We were on the 3rd floor and I would suggest asking for a room on a higher floor, as the traffic noise can be significant. There is a bus stop and tram line stop literally at the front door and the MTR (train stop) a few minutes walk away. Overall a good and recommended experience I'd you're staying on Hong Kong Island.","I'm staying at the Fraser suites for a month and decided to share my impressions after the frst two weeks already. This is definitely a good choice for business travellers and for those visiting HK on holidays as well. It not only offers very good value for money because of the competitve rates and great location (right next to Wan Chain MTR station and with plenty of shops and restaurants around - and still so quiet inside !!!), the quality of the staff is impressive. They are flexible, customer-minded and always able and eager to solve your porblems effectively and with a smile in their face. This is my preferred choice for future stays in HK, no doubt !! The building is in a very good location, close to central, across the street from the Metro and right on a tram stop to take you into the financial district. Rooms are very nice, well furnished, extremely clean with very nice bathrooms. The kitchen is a perfect size and has all the amenities needed to be able to cook dinner on a daily basis. Also includes a washer/dryer which was not expected. Perfect executive type apartments for both short and especially for long term stays. I am here for three months and am perfectly happy. Good location and very clean and quiet. Husband has been here for about three months on business, and I came for a visit.

I had a month at Fraser Suites this year. While working in Hong Kong. Firstly the good: The rooms are much larger than they look on the website. The reservations manger is very lovely. Bose IPOD doc is great. The kitchen is well equipped. Both a Marks & Spencer plus a Welcome mart nearby. Washer/dryer in kitchen (see below) lots of wardrobe space so you can up pack Trams are out the front as well as the MTR Good Gym Not so good. They have a policy of keeping your deposit for 30 days after you check out so if you stay a month you don't get your deposit back for 60 days and your credit card's refunded. Beware the FX rate can move a lot in 60 days. It also meant my company credit card was over it's limit. Big construction site nearby (just underway no sleeping in on Saturday). Pool is open weird hours. Very basic cable TV channels Taxi's cant pick up or drop off at the hotel. On arrival you have to drag your bags for 3 blocks. It also makes checking out interesting. Washer/dryer - the people above me put on their washing machine every night. I had to buy ear plugs because of the noise. The floors are floating floor boards, so you hear every step the people above make in shoes. McDonalds in the basement - a bit too handy. There's 4 rooms per floor, A,B,C & D. I had an A. C & D seem like the best. If your in an ""a"" room you have an office block a few metres away looking straight into your room and the ""B"" room looks straight in as well (building is ""t"" shaped."") If you get a B or C which are smaller you have a little more privacy as the football field is across the road. If you like to have the curtains open at all make sure you don't get an ""A"" room. Compared to other serviced apartments in Hong Kong, many with harbour views, the Fraser Suits just don't represent good value for money. They're a little claustrophobic, even by Hong Kong Standards. A photo showing how close the offices are to your window and the ""B"" room are below.",,,

Tip- Buy a Berlin Welcome card for 25 Euros, it gives 3 days unlimited travel on buses and trains right out to Potsdam and the airports, also gives great discounts on Berlin attractions. The hotel staff were very nice and spoke good English, breakfast was excellent, cold meats, cheeses, salad, breads etc, all served in spacious dining room. Our room was very large with a beautiful ceiling and chandaleir. It also had a seperate couch and work table. The room was not modern but was tastefully decorated and very clean. The room was well heated despite the freezing tempratures outside. We had a large corner bath in a seperate bathroom, which was very nice but took about 30 minutes to fill. The bathroom also had a hair shower attached to bath with a short pipe. As the bath took so long to fill, in the mornings we had to hold the hair shower over each other to get a shower. All good clean fun and it made for a memorable hoilday experience. If you didn`t know your room mate too well before your stay, you will afterwards! A very nice hotel full of character and charm that you don`t get in the big chain hotels. we had made reservations at the Comet Hotel. upon our arrival we were informed that they did not have a room for us but would transfer us to the Wittelsbach. Elizabeth, the receptionist at Wittelsback, was waiting for us and did everything possible to make us comfortable and welcome. we were in a rather small triple room the first night, but were up graded to a suite for the rest of our stay. the breakfast was much better than in most places. a good, well-located hotel with excellent personnel. an extra thank-you to Elizabeth! Excellent staff. VERY friendly and helpful. Rooms are outdated, but adequate. It was hot in Berlin (90's) and very hot in the rooms. No fans available. Breakfast is good for most people. If you tend to be vegetarian, there is a store around the corner with soymilk, fruits, vegetables, etc. They require all CASH up front.

RoadrunnersNewMexico,119314,"I booked a non-smoking suite SEVEN weeks in advance, yet they had none when we checked in. They had no other rooms and this was close to our meeting, so we had to stay in this smelly cave. The management refused our request for a refund for our inconvenience. They had a take it or leave it attitude. The clerk said just because we reserved a non-smoking room didn't guarantee that we would actually get one. What??? Then why offer non-smoking rooms? The bathroom floor was sticky and dirt was in the corners. There was no lock mechanism in the bathroom door, just door knobs. Blue nail polish was splattered on the bathroom wall and waste basket. The kitchen had one skillet to cook in -- no sauce pans. The upholstered chairs were frayed down to the stuffing, and the carpet was dirty. Don't stay here or any other brand that this corporation owns. We travel to Phoenix once a year to attend a meeting and catch up with colleagues. For several years, we enjoyed staying at the Homestead Suites on Dunlap, but our experience was so bad last year that we vowed never to stay there again.

We were âgreetedâ by baggy-panted and gothic hotel guests smoking outside the front door. The check-in area was cramped and the elevator floor was very dirty. There was an air of dinginess everywhere â¦ down the darkly lit hallways â¦ dusty-leaved fake trees by the elevators. The spa was broken and both the spa and the pool had sand in them; the pool chairs were grimy. So, we had just taken our bathing suits for a ride. Our suite smelled âoff,â like a very sweaty person had stayed there. We found trash still in the kitchen trash bin, a used coffee packet was still in the coffee maker, and someone had left behind a pair of jeans in one of the drawers. The carpet was threadbare, and the bathroom vent had been removed and the wires were exposed in the ceiling. Even after taking a shower, we felt dirty, just because the room was such a downer. We kept our shoes on while we were in the room because we didnât want our bare feet to touch the carpet. This property is surrounded by three Marriott properties. We stopped at one of them to check it out for next year and it was so clean, well maintained and well lit, that we didnât want to leave.

There is no way management doesn't know what is going on and they just don't care.

Well located near highway 17 but hard to find. The cars, heavy gold chain jewelry, tattoos, scary people, foul language from many different people in various places in the hotel tell me that the place is a pimp, drug using, prostitution business. The place smells bad with smoke and mold. The carpets are filthy. Exterior looks and photos are deceiving. Don't let your kids out of the room alone. I stayed here several yers ago when the plac was brand new and the paint was fresh. You were served Chocolate Chips cookies at the front desk in the evenings and the staff was ready to help. it's years later (about 5 years) and the place is already run down and having problems. I travel to Phoenix for business from time to time and always love to get a suite where I can make my own meals, but th kitchen was lacking, the sink in the bathroom was backing up, even after alerting the front desk the matter was not taken of. The air conditoning system wasnt working properly and there were crayon marks all over the furnture.I highly do not reccomend staying here. we stayed on the 3rd floor at Mainstay suites which absolutely reeked of cigarettes. our room was a ""nonsmoking"" room but it still smelled like an ashtray. the other floors were not too bad. The carpets are disgustingly dirty throughout the hotel. I would not let a small child crawl on the floor of our room. That said, the rest of the room was clean, the rooms are spacious, the bed was actually surprisingly comfortable and the plumbing and AC worked great. It does have free WiFi and an adequate free breakfast. So overall it is a good deal but I won't be back- will spend another $40 a night to stay at a place that doesn't stink. Room was nice stayed 1 night. Got my credit card bill a month later and found two charges - one for the $86 for 1 night and another for $602.56. When I called I was told 3 times I would get a call back and never did. I called & called and finally I was told that we were there for 7 nights! Not! I explained to 2 different people & a manager that we were not there except for 1 night and basically was told I was lying. Mgr called me back & said housekeeping cleaned on the days they were supposed to. Obviously they were covering their behinds for ""cleaning"" a vacant room. Finally I offered up the bill from the hotel we DID stay at to get them to reverse the charges. Just faxed it to them - let's see if we actually get refund!? Don't know if an employee is ripping them off somehow or they are just stupid. Watch your bill if you dare stay there. This place could be in a horror film. By far the worst staff no maids down to one only i was told by the front desk man. They clean the rooms every 3rd day! Breakfast no attention always having to ask for things. I truly felt like all they wanted was our money and the rest was up to us. We had to take out garbage take down dirty towels ect. for new (cleaner) ones. I got the impression that it was a family that was running things. The bottom line was there only concern$$$$ . Never will even stay near this place, Stinky ,dirty filthy. And I am not that picky really! I am a Camper ,Hunter. But I have my limits. Terrible.... The hallways stink of smoke, and even if your room is non-smoking the smell inevitably seeps in. If they are going to allow smoking they should segregate by floor. The room was a little tired but ok, with a kitchenette, in-room coffee, comfortable bed, and good wifi. The hotel's address is on the interstate frontage road but it's actually set back quite a ways by a long access driveway so was pretty quiet. Breakfast was the usual waffles, bread, and yogurt. Nothing special but adequate. It's the cheapest option I found in this part of town, and ok for a couple of nights. I traveld to Phoenix for a meeting at a convention center close by. Terri and her staff were very friendly and helpful and I had a great stay and I am on my computer a lot and the internet worked great also. There is a huge mall close by with lots of restaurants so I did not have to go far for dinner.",,,
afshan m,1828529,"Negatives â¢ When I called to confirm I had requested a free upgrade but was told it wasnât possible till I got there. I did inform them that I would be an early check in.

GOOD: The hotel was very clean The rooms are very confusing but the signage is good. The location is pretty safe and as a single traveler that was very important to me The staff was VERY helpful.

The ONLY best western on my spain trip that did that for me. THANK YOU! The breakfast is 8 euro and is a continental breakfast. Instead I went to the shop next door and got fresh bakery stuff that I wanted. With nescafe instant sachets that were also available there. The toiletries were awesome too. My room didn't have a view, but that was fine since I just went to the hotel to sleep The staff helped me chose between different places to visit BAD: i really dont have anything bad to say except that it's a walk to the ramblas, but that was okay. BAD My Reception wasn't that great. I didnât feel quite welcome bath tub utterly small! I could barely turn around. There was a sign that said save water and shower instead of taking a bath. I couldnât do either. Either the shower curtain would stick to me or I'd get bruised by the rod on the tub. No extra soap, just 1 small bar. It was very hot and there was no fan available. All controlled by central heating. Wen its 25 degress outside, the hotel considered it âwinter.â Only 1 power outlet in the room and its socket was loose. Had to use Room service for hot water and milk. I would have preferred some machine in the room, so that I wouldnât have to call every time. the wireless was HORRIBLE! I had to go to the reception twice to have it set up. Someone was supposed to get back to me about an Upgrade. No one did. No wakeup call on day 1 (mar 25) No tissue replacement There was residual music playing for 3 nights. I had to call the receptionist everytime. There was construction till 9 pm mar 28. There was smell of paint and thinner, plus the constant noise of drilling and metal cutting. The noise started again at 830am On mar 29. Paint smell started on mar29 around 6pm. It was horrible. I had to open my room door to let some air in. I actually felt dizzy after a while because of the fumes. Horrible shower head. GOOD The room was very small but well organized.

Close to the Metro station Diagonal. 5min. At the corner of the street is also a bus stop. 2min. Next to the entrance to the hotel is a supermarket. 2) Accommodation Friendly at the reception and also the hotel bar. Clean room and bathroom. We had a room next to the bar so it was a bit noisy. Windows were located towards the garden and there was no sun. Most of the time we were exploring the city so it fulfilled what we expected. A positive thing was the machine with free coffee and tee. Have a nice stay! GOOD: The hotel was very clean The rooms are very confusing but the signage is good.

Pretty decent little hotel for the price! The staff is friendly and speaks English which is rather helpful. You're about a 7 minute walk to the Metro and its in the middle of many of the major attractions. The supermarker next door is a GREAT place to grab a coke and a snack. The only downside to this hotel is that there's a lack of carpet so the mornings are a litte loud This was our first time in Barcelona and we were a little nervous when we booked the hotel not knowing anything about the layout of the city in regards to the location of the hotel but the place was located within walking distnace of everything (las ramlas and metro) and the staff was willing to help with navigating our daily activities. The place is nothing fancy but it was safe and clean...we would stay there again. This is our hotel in Barcelona. We stayed here twice in 2011 and will certainly return. Good rooms, very clean, helpfull staff. Location is perfect. Busstop around the corner. Bus 17 and 16 to Pl.Catalunya and bus 17 even to Barceloneta. Bus 27 to pl Espanya The neighbourhoud is full of nice little shops, restaurants and a market where you will find the normal daily life - Tip: Ask a detailled bus map at an TMB office. We stayed two nights at this hotel and we enjoyed every minute. The staff was extremely helpful and responsive. The hotel is centrally located with in walking distance of all. The room was clean and fresh and the breakfast was good. We highly recommend it... Every space counts, golf course in the rooftop.. its ok.. Not too convenience for transportation, the only one near the hotel is a bus, if you want to use the subway, use the Ferrocarrill first and then the metro , if not walk, walk, walk.. I have never given as negative a review as this (it is not all that bad...) but I think it is justified. The 1st thing is the name should not apply. The golf area was closed when we arrived for check-in and they said that anyway the golf is only as lessons over the weekdays (no good for the weekend guests like us) Then there was the complementary tea or coffee which was in the corridor of the Hotel single floor. Early morning at 7 we thought of helping ourselves only to find that all the glasses had been used and not replaced with new ones. A similar situation in the evening was promptly informed to the Main desk and they got it replaced in 20 minutes! I would not mind then telling us the timing of the complementary coffee over the day! We booked two rooms one across the other which were not identical with one being quite small?! The free wifi is a great plus point & cleanliness is good otherwise... would sadly not recommend again. Get ready for the rudest *word that rhymes with fitch* on the planet running the front desk. She's got brown hair, black glasses, and two horns coming out of her head. I've never actually been to a hotel where I felt like the overall feel was this snooty! Literally, walked in with our luggage and got a nod... minutes pass... sarcasticly how can I help you. The extent of their hospitality was about as classy as a morning dump. Asking for good places to eat or directions and you might as well be asking for them to give you their liver. When I had a problem connecting to their wifi and asked about it, it was ""oh obviously you are a dumba$$"" with no hint of caring if they could just help me figure it out. I would say the rooms were just OK but when you have a devil who works in the lobby, it's hard to enjoy your time. Flash forward to check out - I paid in cash and asked for a receipt. pretty reasonable request right? WRONG. The bimbo at the front literally explodes and has a melt down. ""Why do you need a receipt?!!? The bill is your receipt!!"" ""Uh no, that's a bill"" I answer back. ""If you could just sign it and say I paid, it would help a lot"" NEXT SHE BEGINS HYPERVENTILATING. This chick starts slamming her first on the front desk, panting from apparently was the busiest request of the day, trying to sign her name. And the whole time, the ENTIRE staff has the attitude like ""what, what the hell do you want"". UM I JUST PAID YOU $150 for one nights stay, how about some damn customer service! Good luck if you stay here, give Satan my regards. Very modern, stylie and cheap according to the other hotels in same category. A little far from metro but its easier to travel with the busses if you learn the numbers as the bus stop is @ front. Also a market next to it which is a plus i think.",,,
ChiTDI,73859,"Hotel shares the mountainside with larger hotels and upscale restaurants. Cafe within walking distance. Pool, breakfast and hot tub were fine and the appointments in the rooms were a welcome addition to the comfy and clean beds. Located right off I-8, the location was close to the airport and harbor, and offered access to the interesting Mission Valley neighborhood.

I stayed two weeks to cover the NCAA regionals and some spring training games. The hotel's location gave me proximity to downtown and very easy access to the entire metro area. Public trans if I needed it and many fast food locations to safely walk to and from. The hotel is old but remodeled and very clean. Two story cinder block construction with your car parked right outside your door. All entries are outside. Minimal hotel common areas. They have a good, clean basic breakfast and an operating coin laundry. There is a Denny's and a Starbucks in the parking lot. Well lit, and the rooms are roughly 20X15 with comfortable beds. I sleep soundly so can't comment about noise. Great value if your stay is over a week.","I stayed on two occasions. The first time I found the carpet dirty and smelly but the room was clean otherwise. I let the management know that the carpet needed cleaning and was ensured that the room would be taken care of. I stayed a second time a few weeks later and this time the carpet was clean. However, there was half eaten food in one of the drawers. There seems to be a problem with the staff not doing a thorough job or not caring enough to do a proper cleaning and check of the rooms. Otherwise the rooms were clean. The outside maintenance could be improved but the location was good for me. I stayed two weeks to cover the NCAA regionals and some spring training games.

I sleep soundly so can't comment about noise. Great value if your stay is over a week. We have to go to Phoenix for business fairly often and have found that this LaQuinta is perfect for us. We have tried a few other places but they are just too expensive and although the LaQuinta may not be the fanciest, it is very nice! Lots of pillows,crisp clean linens, nice big screen TV's, friendly staff...we really like it and recommend it to everyone! I've been happy with past La Quinta stays and I understood the kind of hotel I was paying for. But other than the bed, this was a poor experience that I won't recreate. Dirty bathroom. Missing a chunk of wall. I actually didn't take a shower the next morning because it made me uncomfortable. Bad location, sharing a fence with the freeway. Awoken in the middle of the night--several times--by loud other patrons right outside my door. Based on the skeezy location I was afraid my car was being stolen and was pleasantly surprised to find it there in the morning. Also, no business center of any kind though one was advertised. I had a free night with the Rewards program, which is good, otherwise I would be MUCH more upset. I also attained ""Elite"" status before this stay. The rooms were nice, clean and had HDTV. I had virtually NO connectivity to the internet even though I was told the router was 3 rooms away from me. I called the front desk to see if I could get another room and was told they had none available. I hesitate to say this was a lie, but there were about 7 cars in the entire lot so....I was force to tether to my smart phone, which burned through my data plan with surprising speed. I now must wait until Feb 8 until my data plan renews for the month. I always stay at LaQuinta because of the rewards program, but if this is how you are treated when you are ELITE status, I'd rather go back to gold. I usually stay at the Arcadia location and will begin to do so again as I will never stay at this LaQuinta again. At least at Arcadia, I can check my email. Hopefully they will reach out to make this right. If so, I will update this review This is an older property with exterior doors. OK if that's your cup-o-tea. I happen to like parking in front of my door. This was a one night stay on halloween, to take a flight the next day. The area didn't look all that great for walking around - not somewhere I would be outside alone at night. The hotel room was clean. Check-in went well. Walked into the room and the TV was playing a hearth scene. Left too early to have breakfast, but the standard La Quinta fair looked available. Had a good night sleep and an easy drive to the airport in the morning. To keep this short, there was nothing wrong with this hotel, its close to downtown (7mins) and if you're driving has tons of parking. It has food and gas around it, shares a parking lot with Denny's. Helpful staff and a great manager. Cleaning staff....well that's one area they could improve on, the bathroom wasn't cleaned for my 2 night stay since i got there. Everything else was okay. I would recommend staying here for up to a 3 night stay, but anything more i would move into a more comfortable place. We stayed for 9 days while house hunting. The room was clean and beds very comfortable, even after recent back surgery. There was some road noise from the highway, but we ran the fan at night so it was not a big deal. There is a fire station on the back side of the hotel. We never heard sirens. The hotel provided us with a refrigerator and a microwave for our stay. The cleaning staff was friendly and put in long hours. The pool was quite cool, but didn't stop the kids from swimming. They welcomed our dog and had grassy areas for exercising her. The hotel is centrally located. We traveled away from our hotel in the mornings and back to the hotel in the evenings, always in the opposite direction of rush hour traffic. There was a Denny's, Starbuck's, Arby's, McDonald's, Jack-in-the-Box, and a WONDERFUL Italian restaurant within the same block of the hotel. The only negative was that the showerhead in our room was about ear height. We had to duck to shampoo hair. Overall, it was a very good choice for us. We will definitely stay there again.",,,
Sarah W,564338,"This hotel lived up to all the reviews. Great value in an expensive city. The location was ideal to walk to most of what Rome has to offer. The vending machines, which were incredibly reasonable, and the roof terrace were both an added bonus! We arrived 2 hours before official check in and were given the keys to our room with no hesitation. We had previously requested a high room when we made our booking as we had heard the views were great from this hotel. When we arrived at our room we had been allocated a corner room - the views when we opened the bedroom door were amazing. Two whole sides of the room had windows looking out across the whole of Manhatten. We spent 5 nights at this hotel and will stay here again. The location is fabulous to expore on foot. The staff are really helpful. Being honest the bathroom's are a bit dated and could do with being upgraded but considering what we paid it was ok, they were very clean just old. The drinks in the bar were expensive but this is to be expected of a hotel bar, if we wanted cheap drinks we walked to 2nd Avenue where there were a wide selection of bars most with offers on. I left my cell phone there and they sent it to me at santa monica but they put there own zip code on it and I didn't get it before I came back home in Australia they refunded my $30 but I'm still waiting for the $168 that it cost me to get it sent back to Australia, when I was told that it will be and its been 3 to 4 weeks now I've left lost of messages and I haven't heard back. Not happy when we tipped a lot, I will write a better review when I get my $168 back that I was told that I will! We stayed here for three nights at the end of March 2012. Tucked away in a side street but only two minutes walk from San Marco, this is a quiet hotel. Warm, friendly welcome and very helpful people. The room was large and spotlessly clean - good, crisp bed linen which which was changed daily. The bathroom was newly refurbished, spotlessly clean with a good shower. The breakfast area is small, only 3 tables, and a bit of a tight squeeze, however, the breakfast choices were good. All in all a very positive experience. We would stay here again and would recommend it. Just returned from a two night stay here. Thought the location was great, a few blocks from las ramblas and in the shopping area. Rooms were a little sterile and didnât particular enjoy the rain shower head. With that said the room was fairly quiet and the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. I stayed here in July for a week for my honeymoon and would highly recommend this hotel. On arrival, the staff had noted on the system that it was our honeymoon we were presented with gifts including free bottle of wine at the hotel restaurant plus a room upgrade with a beautiful ocean view. Throughout our stay, the staff were extremly helpful. Included in the room prices was the buffet breakfast which had a wide selection of food. The rooms were spacious and cleaned regulary. We will defiantly be returning here in the near future! Just back from 3 nights at this hotel. The location was perfect, 10 min walk from St Peter's and in amongst really pretty cobbled streets. Lots of great, reasonable restaurants in walking distance. Hotel ticked all the boxes for us, clean, reasonable, nice room. You order breakfast the night before from a tick list which included the most fantastic croissants and it was delivered to our room at our chosen time so breakfast in bed every day, including fabulous coffee. Would definitely go back. Beautiful, luxurious hotel - but it is the exceptionally pleasant, professional, courteous and helpful staff that puts it over the top. I would also like to mention that I am very sensitive to odors, and this place smells great! I detected NO odors in our room, and the pleasant aroma of white tea and thyme wafts subtly through the lobby - where we throughly enjoyed complementary glasses of champagne in the evening. We were so comfortable and pleased with our experience here, we will switch from the Taj as our new ""home away from home"" in Boston. Bonus feature: Island Creek Oyster Bar, adjacent to the hotel, is outstanding for dinner or brunch. Enjoy! I stayed at Hotel Claude Bernard during a solo vacation to Paris last week. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan on staying there again. This was my third time to Paris (it is my favorite city), but the first time I truly felt at home in a hotel and neighborhood. You are just minutes away from the metro, cafes, Notre Dame, bookstores. There are some very nice bistros right on the same street. The staff are friendly and helpful and did not make fun of my horrible French. :-) I had a single, which was perfectly fine for me and very clean, though I realize some people would have trouble with the size of the room and bathroom. I don't know how the other rooms are, but I imagine they are all fairly typical of a Paris hotel. The lift is a major plus as well. Good internet connection too.

Loved the location of this hotel and I believe it was a great value. It is located in a quiet square only a few short blocks of Puerta de Sol and close to many attractions and restaurants. Rooms were clean and we had a cute balcony overlooking the square. Had no trouble with noise with at all. I would stay again in a heartbeat.","We stayed here for three nights at the end of March 2012. Tucked away in a side street but only two minutes walk from San Marco, this is a quiet hotel.

It would be difficult initially to find the location from my point of view,but it had good service the hotel sent someone to pick us up in front of the water bus stop. excellent and helpfull personnel and owner, very clean and tidy, good prices, near to main tourist areas. Would definetely go again and suggesting to friends Very close to San Marco's square, and the hotel staff were absolutely a delight to deal with and were very helpful, I especially thank the gentelman who waited for us at a location which was easy to reach from the boat station even though we arrived late that night, since in Venice it could be a nightmare to reach some hotels. The room and bathroom were nice and clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable, and they have a nice coffee machine at breakfast. The amount paid for the room I think is a little high concidering this time of the year, and there supposed to be a central AC unit but I dont think it was running even though the weather was a bit warm during the day, but thats ok. Also, the bread selection and cheese at breakfast can be better. I do recommend this hotel and I would not mind staying there again. We were happy with the room and the location. They now offer to bring breakfast to your room if you feel crowded in the breakfast room which I thought was a nice touch. The owner is only there part of the time so if you want someone there to ask questions- make sure you catch her when you see her. The room was clean, had a fan - no air conditioning and a nice bathroom. Most of the luxuries you would see in nicer hotels.",,,
travelwhenwecan5960,1149316,"The Omni Chicago has one of the best location for seeing Chicago. Right on Michigan and we were able to walk to Rush St. restaurants as well as down to millennium park for some great sight seeing. The staff and service of the Omni was outstanding in every area. The beds were great for a good night sleep and the bathroom was very nice. The only minor concern was some of the sitting area furniture was a little worn but still fine and very functional. The Omni's breakfast buffet was outstanding and a must if you in the area. We stayed at Beau Site in a superior double room for three nights in late May and very much enjoyed our stay. The hotel on the 2nd floor (third by US standards) in a beautiful building. The rooms was very clean with a firm but comfortable bed and quality furnishingsand we were able to sleep very well . It was very warm during our visit and the AC worked great allowing us to adjust the room temperature to our likeing. The bathroom was updated with modern fixtures but the shower stall was a little tight. Breakfast was fine with yogurts, pastries, juice, and good coffee choices. The area was nice to walk around at night really enjoyed restaurant Vladimero around the corner from the hotel. The staff was helpful and professional especially the young lady who worked the front desk at night (forget her name).","My wife and I just returned from Rome and thoughly enjoyed our time and experience. Max and Linda were very easy to communicate with (English) and helpful during our stay. They directed us to some excellent authentic Italian resturants. The location is convient and the room was larger than we expected. Excellent location as all major attractions are within walking distance of the hotel. We just came back from Rome, and our stay at Beau Site was wonderful. Thanks to Fabrizzio and Linda who made us feel so welcome. The hotel is a small place but with all of the amenities that you would need, minibar, WiFi, clean room etc.. They were courteous and helpfull, made lots of suggestions for great places for dinner and places to go. Would like to thank them for making our stay part of a wonderful experience. Just back from Rome, we were there for two nights. Good: not a bad location, very close to Metro Spagna station and spanish steps. Room was clean and bed sheets were in good quality. Bad: Hot water ran out of me in the middle of my shower. I had my shower done around 8:30am and guessed other customers used all they had. Breakfast was below average compares with other places we stayed in the same trip in Rome. Coffee taste like something from dollar stores here in US. ""Aged"" fresh fruits were served. You can see small flies around the breakfast area, they were probably from the ""darken"" bananas. I had diarrhea that day, not saying it was from the breakfast but probably a candidate. Also Just downstair at the corner of via Cadore and via Via Ludovisi there are two bars/restaurants. If you stay there over Friday/Sat nights, be aware they have loud music and customers all past midnight. To aware there are steps to use their elevator up or down stairs. If you are single female and carry a heavy luggage, this is a concern. We stayed in Beau Site in July for a week. It was great time for us first of all because of our wedding. And I'd like to tell thank's a lot to all staff for great service which we had there. Especial thank's to Violetta for hot tea and coffe in the morning, for advice in restaurante choise, for organisation hairdressers for our friends and of course for welcoming at atmosphere in our wedding day for all our guests. Thanks a lot to Slava and all reception staff for made us feel like at home, for good advices and for your help. We definitely come back. )))) As you don't undestand - rooms clean and very nice. Location is perfect. Here everything is perfect! )))) And ones more - THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH! We have just returned from a weekend at Beau Site and we had a great time. Our room was very comfortable and beautifully clean. We had a huge bed - which my husband thought was more comfortable than our one at home (praise indeed!) The staff there were very friendly and although they don't speak much English, and our Italian is non existent, they tried their best and were very helpful and welcoming. They looked things up on the internet for us to give us opening times of various places etc. The residence is close to the Spanish Steps - and there are lots of restaurants in the locality if you don't want to go too far for an evening meal. Stayed here with my husband for 3 nights over a weekend. The place is perfectly OK. On the plus side the building is impressive and the staff are very pleasant. The residence (for that is what it is) is scrupulously clean, the beds are quite comfortable and the room we stayed in initially (one of 6) was quiet despite overlooking Via Ludovisi. We were required to move to another room on our third night as our room had been requested by other guests. This was explained to us on the basis that 206 was a superior room to which we had been upgraded at no extra cost, and on the third night we would be moved back to a classic room (202). There was in fact very little difference between the rooms, 206 being slightly bigger, but I suspect the reality of the situation was that the new guests had read reviews on trip advisor saying that 202 was noisy and didn't want to stay there! It was a bit noisier being near the reception desk and we were woken early by an alarm clock and footsteps in the room above, but it wasn't so bad. On the down side, I cannot really understand the glowing reviews this place has received. I perhaps expected too much from the 4 star rating. The decor is, to me, dated and bland. The shower cubicle (in rooms 206 and 202 at least) was extremely small. My very tall husband couldn't really reach his feet! Stick to tea at breakfast as the black coffee is instant and the cappuccino from a machine - a bit disappointing in the barista capital of the world! The lovely Italian lady on the desk in the evening, who didn't speak English, was unable to suggest where we might be able to get a good pizza, which you might have expected, though she did at least tell us about an area where many restaurants could be found. I would think the proprietor himself might have been more help in this regard but he was off duty all weekend. In short, whilst the Beau Site was basically fine it in no way enhanced our stay in Rome. If you are looking for just a clean quiet bed, great, but if you want somewhere with a little quirkiness and romance, this definitely isn't the place for you. This place is a little gem! Perfectly situated in a lovely central neighbourhood- easy walking distance to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the metro which means anywhere is easily accessible. Massimiliano, Maya and the other staff made us very welcome and nothing was too much trouble for them be it recommendations or directions. A really comfortable and relaxing base- don't miss this place! Thanks very much for a great stay!ps- don't miss the wee bar/cafe opposite the hotel too, Bar Ludovisi. I stayed at the Beau site for only one night, with my six year old daughter. I could say nothing bad about this hotel: extremely clean, wonderful staff, marvellous position, it made our stay in Rome perfect. I highly recommend it to those who search for a different type of accomodation. Fair priced accomodation for a spacious room, in one of Rome's best neighborhoods. Really close to Via Veneto, Trinita dei Monti, Piazza di Spagna, Piazza Barberini and Villa Borghese. The director of the hotel - Massimiliano, his parents and the staff were all very kind and helpful, even if they could not all speak english very well - special thanks to Maya for her help and advise in what to see and where to eat. The room was really clean and comfy. We had a general feeling that we stayed in a friendly house and not in a hotel. We would definitely go back next time we are in Rome, we do recommend it without a doubt - but have in mind that you stay in a small ""hotel"" with only 5-6 rooms, which means you don't have all the luxuries or the formalities of a huge tourist hotel. We stayed at Beau Site in a superior double room for three nights in late May and very much enjoyed our stay. The hotel on the 2nd floor (third by US standards) in a beautiful building. The rooms was very clean with a firm but comfortable bed and quality furnishingsand we were able to sleep very well . It was very warm during our visit and the AC worked great allowing us to adjust the room temperature to our likeing. The bathroom was updated with modern fixtures but the shower stall was a little tight. Breakfast was fine with yogurts, pastries, juice, and good coffee choices. The area was nice to walk around at night really enjoyed restaurant Vladimero around the corner from the hotel. The staff was helpful and professional especially the young lady who worked the front desk at night (forget her name). I stayed at the Beau Site with my 2 teenage sons and my parents from Dec 26th 2009 thru Jan. 2nd 2010. The accomodations were amazing. We felt very safe and the block was quiet. The rooms were immaculate, spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were state of the art, although the showers were a little difficult to navigate at first. The location was within walking distance to many restaurants, the Metro, the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. When we wanted to go farther, Luigi called a cab for us. Breakfast was more than enough and included cakes, yogurt, cereal, milk, fruit and juice. If I am fortunate to visit Rome again, I would definately stay at this hotel.",,,
GMI54,309919,"The Fairmont Hotel Waterfront is located next to the harbour in the centre of Vancouver. The Convention Centre is next to the hotel. My room was spacios but it sould be refurbished in the next time! One can see everywhere that the hotel is not any more the newest. Furthermore, the quality of the breakfast was only standard and it seemed to me overpriced! This hotel is absolutely horrible! The accomodation was that run down, that even rainwater from the roof trickled into my room. Though having claimed immediately the managing director did no efforts for a room change. Furthermore the shower in the bathroom was full of mildew! I never will sleep here again! The Hotel Palace is a perfect choice for a luxuriuos stay in Berlin. It is located next to the Zoo Station. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was a little bit small but excellent cleaned. The nice little gift present was a really good idea.

We stayed here is the second hotel.that one not really good as we expected but for us we think OK. One thing we did not like at this hotel , We felt the room very old and all sheets and pillows are so old and Long time been used. We hope net time come back the hotel will be changed much and have a lot of customers. The hotel is pig but service need improve Swimming pool is nice and the price is suitable not very high for the room.",,,
angela7,306624,"Although this hotel is in Wanchai, in the red light district of Hong Kong, it was good value for money. It is a modern hotel and the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant,,The rooms were spotless, and best of all it is five minutes walk to the tram and the metro. There is a Pacific Coffee a few doors away and in the immediate area are all sorts of decent restaurants. The one thing that sticks in my mind ....the exceptionally helpful and pleasant staff from check in to housekeeping. Very competent. No complaints at all. I have yet again stayed at the Al Khaleej Hotel, and as usual it is absolutely perfect for a stopover and so close to the souks, you can walk to them within five or ten minutes. The staff are absolutely lovely, all very pleasant from the doormen who are keen to help carry the luggage for you (often with no tip!) but pleasant anyway, to the girls on the Reception (thank you Irene!!) to the staff in the restaurant. They have an excellent breakfast which is included in the price most times, and their menu, particularly the lamb chops and the pizzas are wonderful and a good price. I travelled alone, and they make it safe and welcoming. This hotel is does not have a swimming pool and so it is better for business people and shopping. Thank you Al Khaleej Hotel for your wonderful hospitality. I have stayed at this hotel for many years, and each time I always find the staff extremely pleasant to deal with (thank you Irene!) and the breakfast is certainly enough to feed an army. Fresh rolls, fruit, omelettes, etc. The rooms are adequate with a balcony most having views of the creek and within two minuites walk. This hotel is in an interesting old area close to the souks (walking distance ten minutes) and markets. It is not a tourist hotel as it does not have a pool, but if you are interested in shopping and want to see the old part of Dubai go for it. There is also a great little place just around the corner that does reflexology and massage for ladies only. They do serve great Italian food in the little restaurant and the most lovely chocolate cake (thank you Chef!). Good value for money considering the outrageous prices some hotels charge in Dubai. Thank you Al Khaleej !! You might think this is a hotel, but it clearly states on the door of your room that in fact it is a guest house. Plus points, very helpful and friendly staff, from the cleaning ladies to the girls on the front desk and the polite and helpful manager Henry. They will help you with any questions you may have. Even the guys carting your luggage up those stairs are kind and don't complain. I must say the room was spotless, and cleaned extremely thoroughly every morning. The area is very interesting and it is handy for taxis, trams, etc. lots of little cafes and restaurants around. The restaurant adjoining the Mingle has wonderful and very fresh Chinese food...again, the staff are lovely. Negative point...room is absolutely minute! But I did have a little patio all to myself with table and chairs which made it more bearable. I do think it was overpriced, but then, you are on HK Island And HK is notorious for highly priced hotel rooms.","I have yet again stayed at the Al Khaleej Hotel, and as usual it is absolutely perfect for a stopover and so close to the souks, you can walk to them within five or ten minutes.

Located on Nasser square - shopping paradise for former soviet union shoppers - electronics, cheap clothes, leather and furs - all in one place and for cheapest prices in the world, 10 minutes walk from metro station, taxis all around. Hotel staff was very nice, russian-speaking-client-oriented), prolonged our stay without problem, though they were overbooked. Room price 350dhs for double, 300dhs for single. Also, for the Valentine's day they decorated lobby, restaurant and outside with baloons, hearts , gave out small presents to couples which was unexpected and neat. On the whole it was a very nice stay, I would definitely stay there again. Why pay more if it is used only for sleeping and storing purchases? Also you may save on internet, because wi-fi is free in the hotel, unlike many others of this price range.",,,
nizsat,2100663,"just went recently on 7th march, no cot for the baby, the answer was they only have one and its in use, tiny rooms and very very tiny bathroom you will struggle to get in, rooms very cold as they switch the central heating off through the night so they can save some money. breakfast ; you need to pay additional fee to get the full english however the rest of it is just toast ,butter jam and cereal no variety at .I was really surprised to such a hotel like this withinthe united kingdom and especially in london????????????????? nice hotel in a central location to all major attraction, good customer service , beautiful and tasty food( went half board) rich breakfast , free internet use and wifi","Do not stay here. Had my camera stolen out of my room and the manager did nothing, and neither did the Police. I was there with Gate 1 Guided Tour of Turkey Days Oct. 2011 nice hotel in a central location to all major attraction, good customer service , beautiful and tasty food( went half board) rich breakfast , free internet use and wifi We were moved to the Amethyst Hotel by Virgin Vacations at the last minute...with no option from Virgin to cancel the trip (even after purchasing their 'for any reason' trip insurance!). Uggh. Our original hotel was located in the very convenient and desireable Sultanhamet area of Istanbul, and they let us know just a few days prior to our departure that our new hotel, the Amethyst, would be over two miles away from the historic sights of Sultanhamet. I have no complaints about the Amethyst, though it's a different story for Virgin Vacations! The hotel itself is lovely...clean and modern, with a friendly and efficient staff. I especially recommend the hammam and gorgeous grotto-like swimming pool. I'm a huge fan of Turkish massages, and had two unforgettable ones by a masseuse named Vienna. I highly recommend her, even if you aren't staying at the Amethyst! The downside of the Amethyst is that it's located in a down-scale commercial area, with few restaurants nearby and no tourist sights for miles. Unfortunately, we did not feel especially safe walking in this area at night, even from the nearby Aksary tram station. Be prepared to take a taxi at US$10-$30 per ride into the historic Sultanhamet area of town. Again, I loved the Amethyst...if only it could be dropped into a different neighborhood. Having stayed in a supposed 4 start in Turkey before, and having to book this hotel last minute, I wasn't expecting much. How pleasantly wrong I was. The Amethyst is a really comfortable, well equipped hotel just 10 minutes walk from the Grand Bazaar,and maybe a further 15 mins to the Blue Mosque and other main sites in Sultanahmed. A very good and cheap tram line is just 2 minutes away in Aksaray, so again a well placed hotel. It's a quiet hotel, just off a main road, but right in the hearty of the hustle and bustle of street life in Istanbul, with its street traders, shops, cafes and restaurants. The reception staff speak good English and are ever helpful. There is also free wifi. For breakfast there is a very decent set of choices and we didn't have to wait during any of the 4 mornings we stayed. I would deifnitely stay there again on a return trip to this truly unforgettable city. The only downside is the poor exchange rate at reception. This is not a probem since you can shop for money elsewhere,but be aware that if you haven't paid in advance you will proabbly be paying in the local currency. We stayed at Amethyst for 4 nights while on holiday. We arrived at midnight only to be told that our booking not confirmed and that we should find another hotel! Not a great start! The hotel reservation staff did not inform us that the rooms are not available until we arrived at their doorstep! However, the manager and all other members of the staff were very courteous and helpful, and they somehow managed to give us a room. They were also extremely apologetic and even offered us tea/coffe while the room was being prepared for us. The front desk staff was very friendly, warm and helpful. In particular, the man at the reception called Mehmet who went out of his way to help us with anything we needed. The hotel is in a very good location and is only 10 mins away from the main attractions. When we checked out at 3 am, the staff packed breakfast for me and my wife for our onward journey even though our package did not include breakfast. There may be many other similar hotels in town, but whats makes Amethyst special is the friendly and helpful staff.",,,
arnsch,1308958,"The location is a bit off, even though it is right in the center of Berlin. Within 10 minutes you can walk to Potzdamer Platz or 20 minutes to department store KaDeWe. The room was nice, good view and quite location. The ministry of defense is right across the street. The size of the hotel surprised me, especially when you walk into the lobby. They have huge conference rooms and the hotel was bursting when I arrived. The pool area is nice - large pool and the pool is open late until 11:30pm, which I found very convenient. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful ! Will come back, especially at this price via Priceline. We stays at the nu-hotel and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The location is in a very quite neighborhood. Acess to public transport is an easy 10-minute walk. Supermarket (open until midnight) also very close. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. The room as clean and perfect for our needs. Breakfast was good, nothing special, but perfect for a city-tour and included in the room rate. Will definitely come again !! Very good value for money. The hotel is located in walking distance from Zoo train station - even with a bit of baggage. The trip from the airport by public transport was very easy. The location is right next to the main shopping area, but very quite at the same time. Breakfast was very good, though hotel-price expensive. The pool is a bit small. Almost the size of a big jacuzzi. Would come back. Nice experience. This hotel is huge ! With this comes a great level of efficiency and service. Located in walking distance to a subway station and next to a bus stop (convenient line 100 which passes by lots of sightseeing points), the hotel occupies a whole bock. It's easy to get lost in the hotel due to the size. The room as very clean, flatscreen TV, nice bathroom. Even though the room faced a buisy street, noice was okay on the 6th floor. Breakfast was very good with lots of choice, hot&warm, German rolls and fresh orange juice. Only negative point: no swimming pool.","Reading some of the reviews you would think we should never book his place. But i did anyway. We stayed 4th to 7th December 2011. As mentioned its a short walk to both the U and S bahn train services that can get you to all the main places quickly. Breakfast was fine with a good selection of cereals, cold meats and bread, eggs and sausages. Staff, we never experienced any of the poor service mentioned in other reviews - perhaps its all about what attitude we as customers have as well!!!! The room had all you need, a bed, a TV, a shower and toilet - its a room folks, you sleep there! We could have done with another two days to take in more of the city and will probably come back in spring or summer - and no reason not to stay here. One tip. We did teh bus tour the first morning which is fine but on the second day we did a walking tour with www.insidertour.com its a 3 1/2 to 4 hour walk with a break and gave us so much more information and knowledge. Its not hard work and i can guarantee your interest will be maintained, plus of course you can ask questions as you wander. They do a number of tours and if we had extra time we woudl have done a couple more - try it instead of the bus and see it all up close. We arrived earlier than check in and the very friendly staff were more than happy to look after our cases. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from the train station and if anyone is going to the O2 Centre it is about 15mins walk away. The bedroom / bathroom were very clean and tidy and because bedrooms face on to an inner courtyard, a totally silent night was enjoyed. The breakfast at 6euros was probably the best we have experienced for a while. Lots of fresh fruit / yoghurts / cereals / eggs and sausages plus continental breakfast choices. Lovely choice of hot drinks, which were topped up as required by the very attentive staff. Supermarket a few mins walk away and plenty of cafes / restaurants locally. We liked very much the staff of the hotel, their hospitality and kindeness. They gave us a very good homefeeling. The hotel is equiped with all the facilities needed. The rooms and the public areas ars very clean. We liked our stay at the hotel and will come back on our stays in Berlin We stays at the nu-hotel and enjoyed every minute of our stay.

We enjoyed our stay at this small hotel that largely caters to students. It was quiet, safe, clean and the staff was very helpful in replying to requests, giving suggestions, etc. We felt very lucky to have found a such a good value ... we didn't spend our whole trip budget on accommodations. I liked having a small frig and microwave in the room so we could eat breakfast at the hotel. There are good restaurants, coffeeshops and groceries nearby ... City Diner was a favorite spot with excellent food and service. It's New York City, you never get what you pay for. Im 40 yr old female who took her 65 yr old mother. The room and bathroom was clean and, it's not like your hanging around in your room 24 hours a day. We left by 0900 and returned around 2000 give or take. I had a bed, shower, TV, mini fridge, and a microwave, good enough for us. Down fall-last night I was there I had to call them because I didnt get any clean towels. They sent someone right away. We wanted coffee for the morning but the rooms have no coffee pots. They gave us a electric pot to warm water in and we purchesed instant at the local store. They were also nice enough to round up a couple coffee cups for us to use. The day crew at the front desk were nice, the evening crew, not so much. My biggest complaint would be, I called for a 0520 wake up call to make an early morning flight. It was a good thing I set my phone alarm because I never received that wake up call. I also had arranged the night before to have the car service pick us up at 0600 and when I got down front he told me it was for 0630. He did however call and the service was there within 10 min. Would I stay here again? Yes I would. Its a clean safe quiet place in a good location. If you are looking for plush, go to the Hilton. This is a inexpensive way to stay in New York. We had 2 small rooms, private bathroom in-between rooms. The view of the Hudson was beautiful, day and night. 3 blocks from subway, 2 blocks from H & H bagel and Zabars deli. Very quiet neighborhood. Hotel was quiet as well. They held our bags the day we checked out until we were ready to leave that night. Night clerk was very helpful in getting us extra pillows and towels. Fridge and microwave in room were added bonus, although there was no coffeemaker, that was a slight disappointment. Would be planning on staying here again.",,,
moeniddo,1109404,"our travel agency recommened this hotel near istiklal street. i went with my fiance' and friends. i saw the pictures on the brochure before going their but i did not keep the high expectations since hotels put their best rooms in their best conditions. i have read lots of reviews and i was not incouraged much. when we arrived there, i realised their cleanliness, the rooms where big enough and the food was good. i had in mind that the staff will be rude but at the end we became good friends with them and they where very helpfull. i highly recommend this hotel but you have to keep in mind that you need to have good attitude before you reach it. the staff are really nice if you are nice to them. the only thing about this hotel is that it does not have views from the rooms. but if you are going to istanbul for the fun and business, who needs a view of the hotel where you can find best views from cafe's and resturants near by. it is a great place to sleep at. i have chosen this hotel after reading the comments... the location was just perfect and the view is awsome and breath taking.... we really enjoyed turkish coffee on the terrace at night ..u have to be careful during breakfast if you are having it on the terrace, the seagulls might steal some of your food as it happened to me ... but it was funny.... it was great... the staff are more than great too .. they helped us a lot around and gave us lots of useful advice... the only missing thing is that the rooms are small but who cares to sleep, we wanted to enjoy istanbul to the max... I will be going to Turkey this month but unfortunatly i will not be staying at this hotel bec my friends already booked in an hotel in taksim .... but definitly i will pass by the hotel to have the turkish coffee on its terrace...","Double room there was only one drawer by the bed. Towels had holes in them & were not always replaced with clean ones Could not open the cupboard to hang your clothes up as the doors hit the side of the bed only 4 hangers. Also could not use the safe. Used cups & glasses were not replaced with clean ones.. Bathroom fittings were loose & falling off the wall, shower taps did not work, showers had very slippery surface Did not have rubber mats for their guests. Breakfast buffet very poor with not inviting & healthy choices As for the room service menu they only seemed to have pasta dishes. dear sir after challenging a lot finally I arrived to the hotel and I found that they are very impolite and they act like a thief!! because of hotel problem with my credit card I should pay all of money at the beginning and despite of my booking reservation they asked me 880$!!! when I told them I should pay 824$ and they found that I knew the price I gave them totally amount!!!!826$! the sauna, Turkish bath and even if Jacuzzi is not free and we should pay money to use them !!! They didn't clean my room and in my bathroom the trashcan was not empty at the arriving!!!!!!! I think it is the worse hotel you can stay If you are planning a trip to Istanbul it would be better to sleep in a park but not golden park. it's a creepy one, they will charge you for everything. they would steal from your minibar as long as the can. Except one of the receptions -i wish i knew his name-, others are horrible, they are everything but not friendly,specially the bigger one with eye glasses, the pool is about 3*4.5 m^2 but when it's as cold as the north pole ,the size is not a matter. each day we experienced several electricity problems. i was taking a shower and the electricity went off . i was asleep and it happened again, so then the air conditioner turned off, and now i have a cold. it's really dirty. it's located in a good place, near taksim square. the breakfast is delicious. but the orange juice tastes like hell. i never recommend this hotel to anyone. it was full of arabs . our travel agency recommened this hotel near istiklal street. i went with my fiance' and friends. i saw the pictures on the brochure before going their but i did not keep the high expectations since hotels put their best rooms in their best conditions. i have read lots of reviews and i was not incouraged much. when we arrived there, i realised their cleanliness, the rooms where big enough and the food was good. i had in mind that the staff will be rude but at the end we became good friends with them and they where very helpfull. i highly recommend this hotel but you have to keep in mind that you need to have good attitude before you reach it. the staff are really nice if you are nice to them. the only thing about this hotel is that it does not have views from the rooms. but if you are going to istanbul for the fun and business, who needs a view of the hotel where you can find best views from cafe's and resturants near by. it is a great place to sleep at. The location of this hotel is good, situated near the Taksim square in a guarded area with limited traffic. However, this is also the only positive to be said about the Golden Park Hotel. The staff is rude and do not offer any service. In addition, the enter occupied rooms at all times of the day, including in the middle of the night when hotel guests are sleeping, supposedly to add to the mini bar, change towels, etc. without having been requested by the guest. The breakfast buffet is primarily sweets, which makes it difficult for anyone not eating sweets for breakfast to find something. The rooms are big, but the interior is bashed and not well maintained and the air condition is not functioning. My room was 40 degrees Celsius despite that I turned the air condition to lowest possible temperature. Upon request for help from the reception, I just got an angry answer that they cannot do anything, and that I should open the window. In addition, the wall are very thin, so if you are a light sleeper, you will hear when all the party people are returning from the nightlife throughout the night. Finally, if you have Turkish friends of business partners, do not invite them to your room. The front desk will start to call you after 5 minutes upon arrival that they should leave or you will be expelled from the hotel. All in all, the Golden Park Hotel was a very interesting experience that I will not like to repeat or want anyone to experience. DO NOT STAY HERE! This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. This hotel is dirty; there were bugs in our room. The staff was very rude and never helpful and the AC did not work. Staying at this hotel ruined our stay in Istanbul. Traveled to Istanbul for the Grand Prix in May and wanted a hotel near the Taksim nightlife/bars. Hotel location is in a quiet side street and the hotel itself is clean and modern. Breakfast is included and is varied enough for most appetites although it is pretty much the same selection every day. We had a triple room, which has en suite,air-con, TV minibar (highly priced - not surprising really). Hotel has a free pool and pay for services (sauna, Turkish bath, massages etc). Rooms have a button to request do not disturb or to clean the room rather than a hanger on the door - just remember to press it if you want your room cleaned. Most people would probably recommend staying in the Asian side of Istanbul if going to the Grand Prix but the public transport is top rate so its only 1 hour and 4.50 TL to get there and you are closer to the bars and restaurants of the more modern Eastern Istanbul I have been there for 7 nights with my family , we were 9 with 2 under 6 year old children. It was a pleasant stay. I always have stayed in 5 stars but this hotel was very good for being 4 star compare with other 4 star taksim hotels.we had 1 double and 2 triple rooms. double room was small but very clean and in modern style ,flat screen LCD was also available.it was an ideal location 2 minutes walk to taksim square , bus terminal and metro.there was plenty of Turkish and also fast food restaurant nearby. hotel staff weren't friendly but if you ask a question they will help you.breakfast was the same every day and it was not special . I can say in overall it was a nice stay.",,,
TatilSeverUS,2515731,"The hotel looks a bit old from the outside, but the room we stayed at was very clean and fairly large with a nice sofa. The furniture was old fashioned, but in good shape, with just a few nicks and scratches here and there. The room got a good amount of daylight thanks to the sliding door into the little balcony. (Not every room has the same floorplan though. I saw one with a small living area with the daylight perpetually blocked by the bathroom.) No dusty or moldy smell that I sometimes get even in some well known chains. The road noise is quite loud, but it was acceptable if I keep the sliding door closed. I can stay here again, but I cannot say I loved it. We definitely prefer the Hilton Garden Inn on the other side of the freeway. It is definitely more elegant. The furniture there is more modern and they have a nice reception area with high ceilings, a fireplace and comfy couches.

Only delivery to the hotel is pizza. But the staff are very friendly, comfortable rooms and beds and no complaints about the hotel itself. We stayed here after spending 4 nights in a Holiday Inn downtown San Diego and found this far better value (free car parking, free breakfast, nicer room). The bed was comfortable, the room airy and clean and the shower had good pressure. There was free wi-fi available also, which was useful. We were happy here and would recommend it for anyone visiting San Diego on vacation as long as you have a car. This is a very convenient location with a excellent restaurant and bar next door (Elephant Bar). This is now a Holiday Inn Express, no longer a Holiday Inn as of January 2012, even though it is still listed as a Holiday Inn. The property has been recently remodeled and the breakfast only restaurant, has been converted to a HIE eating area. This is a new conversion so not everything is to HIE standards, namely there were no cinnamon rolls or the new pancake machine. The staff is good, and they made the effort to bring me a new room key when mine didnât work. I didnât have to slog up to the desk or wait long for the bell man arrival. The rooms are average, and the TV has poor reception on some stations, but they have been upgraded to flat screens so it was acceptable but not ideal. The bathroom had two lotions and shampoo instead of conditioner, shampoo, and lotion. I didnât find this out till I was already in the shower. Just a little disappointment, but a easy oversight by the staff. Again I have found that the bathroom central exhaust is not functioning. It leads to steamy showers, and in wet climates mold. But in this area since itâs so dry the only downside is steamy showers. Good property and will improve after the complete transition.

Fortunately, we did not hear any construction noise, except in the reception area. This hotel, if you can call it that is interesting. I have stayed here on business and can say it is the worst POS hotel in the US. Yes, its bad folks. WHy? 1) Horrible Service 2) Overcharges 3) Incompetent Staff 4) Noisy Rooms 5) Outdated 1960's decor 6) The list goes on and on. This hotel (motel) might be good for some people wanting a one-star hotel, and no frills, nothing fancy. I need a place to lay my head. I would recommend elsewhere. I got there and they didn't even have my room folks please. I could really rip this hotel apart for the stuff that went down, but I'm warning you if you're coming from out of town, don't stay here. Staying on the street would be about the same experience. It's horrible. No one can actually justify giving this more than one star. The price is the only thing saving it, and even that's not a consolidation. We had a Lacrosse tournament in Rancho Bernardo and waited too long to make reservations. We had only 2 choices and unfortunately I chose the Holiday Inn. They had a great rate of $112 for the ""Presidential suite"". As others have said, there was little to no parking and the spaces were tiny. Check in was nice and easy. We started walking down the hall to our room and had to walk through a ""Pardon our Dust"" sign, literally walking on plywood sheets and paint tarps all over the ground. The room was pretty stuffy as the AC was off. I turned it on and set it to 70. We were there 2 nights and it never got below 76 the whole time we were there. It was not very comfortable. The beds were hard as rocks. The reason we picked this room is because it had a pull out couch for the kids. There were no pillows or blankets in the room for the pullout, only the sheets that were already on it. As it turns out we didn't need blankets because it was so hot in the room. They allow dogs at this hotel. We got to hear dogs barking right below us much of the time we were in the room. The light was burned out in the toilet room which was annoying. The shower water pressure was extremely low(hard to rinse shampoo out of your hair) and never got hotter than ""warm"". I am not a complainer and we never said anything to the front desk so I don't know what they would have done. We didn't spend much time in the hotel and I didn't feel like moving all our stuff. There are about 5 hotels in this close area. for $15 - $25 bucks more a night, I would gladly try the Courtyard, Hilton Garden Inn which are close by. My stay at this facility was AWESOME....not only did I enjoy the rest but Mr. G and his entire staff were very courteous. They went above and beyond....when I needed a ride, towels, or anything. I recommend anyone to stay here. Thank you Mr. G and the entire staff. Maurice J.",,,
TsvetelinaR,193649,"The staff did not understand English very well. No elevator, extremely steep stairs. My room was in the basement. Rooms & Bathrooms - terribly small and dirthy; Breakfast - poor (consisting of bread, jam and yellow cheese only). Location - close to Paddington Station (10 min. by walk) and Ðarble Arche (30 min. by walk) - the only nice thing about the hotel. Excellent location in Charlottenburg - very close to S-Bahn and U-Bahn stops, various restaurants and nice shopping area. A big disadvantage is that there is no internet access in the rooms (it is available only in the reception area). My room was on the fifth floor and was clean and spacious; however, the elevator takes you half storey before the level of the rooms and you should climb 9-10 stares with the suitcase before you reach your room. Pelows were very uncomfortable. The breakfast was good. The stuff (mostly Russians) was not really polite and helpful. It is overprised, even in the periods of big events (f.e. ITB, Messe Berlin).","Small room - typical for London but well worth the money as very cheap rates and great location! Clean and 24 hours reception. We have to agree that we should be subjective in our in our expectations for a hotel that you can pay GBP25 a night! If you expecting that you are staying in Hilton where you would pay GBP 220 (almost 10 times) then do not even think about it â¦ This is a budget hotel, that you pay the minimum money you can pay, in return for a privet room in amazing location in central London â¦ simply for a comfort sleep under a roof in a clean place with a privet bathroom..for only GBP 25 If you want to compare this hotel you should compare it with Hostels â¦ Iâm not expecting when Iâm evaluating a Hostel I would not do it based on a Hotel standards Conclusionâ¦ this hotel is not appropriate for families, but would be a very good options for singles and youth The staff did not understand English very well.

If you are looking for a nice cheap place to stay in paddington TRUST ME when i say this is not it very poor service ,breakfast is cold tea and toast ,broken toilet seats ,dirty sheets,doors that dont fit,hope this review helps many people. i certainly wont be staying here again. although reviews were bad for this hotel i figured how bad could it be..well let me tell you....the room was in the basement down appx 13 stairs (the lift was broken)..so i hobbled down there fore had to leave suitcase in main lobby... room was old and dirty...needed cleaning...although towels were clean and there was soap and tea/coffee available. reviews had said springs came out of matresses and they were right....springs were popping out hotel needs a full makeover I would like to let you know about the hotel that we were to stay in for three nights, first of all it was filthy,dirty, the springs in the mattress was poking out the bed, under the sheet there was a folded cover to try and stop the springs popping out, the bed spread was all stained and smelt. the nets was black with muck,the curtains was hanging down, the so called rug was filthy, the paint work was filthy, even the windows was sealed with masking tape, i have never ever seen or been in a hotel like this, we were disgusted in it , i mentioned the bed etc to the woman on the desk all she said was i can get you some more covers to put on the mattress to stop the springs, i was horrified, i have spondilosis in my spine and the expected me to sleep on that bed!! i asked for a refund as there is no way i was staying a moment more in that place, i think sleeping on the street with the homeless would of been better, we ended up staying at a travel lodge as there is no way i would of slept there, BE WARNED!!!! I seriously don't know why this place gets so much flack. I stayed at prince william for a weekend back in january 2011 n i found it very comfortable and convenient. We stayed in room G4 which was well stocked and the staff were helpful but pretty glum, its london and u shudn't expect any less. it may not b a 5 star hotel but its great value for money and the location is perfect, close to paddington tube station. don't let the reviews deter you, i would highly recommend this place as a good value-for-money hotel if your plannin on stain in town for a couple of days. a budget hotel in need of updating. Not mearly a little tired but exhusted. Cutains that were falling off their poles and very dirty, a scruffy bed throw, cheap laminate flooring, a TV with no ariel, trailing electrical leads, a kettle with nowhere to plug it in, Tea bags that looked very old and no milk. The free continental breakfast was no more than a choice of sliced white or brown bread, a small plate of sliced cheese and a toaster which sometimes worked if you held the knob down. On the up side, the entrance lounge was inviting and the hotel is central for sight seeing. would i stay there again. NO! No place to go ... not your money worth - bad room - bad bed - no service in restaurant - minimal breakfast - no friendly staff Sorry to say but I was a victim of theft at this hotel. A valuable item was stolen from my room. I found this hotel in a good location at a reasonable rate. On my first night, my room was beside the elevator and it was very noisy because the door banged and people would be coming and going at all hours. On my second night, my room was changed. The front desk clerk said my new room was not ready but my belongings would be moved while I was out for the day. When I returned home late last night, I was repacking and discovered that an item worth 500 USD was missing. I am absolutely positive I left it in the room. Yes, I know there are signs that say the hotel is 'not responsible for valuables left in the rooms' but I cannot carry everything with me all day. I didn't expect that this gave them license to steal. Super disappointed. When I asked to look through their lost and found items they said they didn't have any. I guess it's finders-keepers at the Prince William Hotel in London, UK. Was offered a basement room next to the lift, can hear the creaking of the floor above. It's a very basic hotel with the room tiny but was all I needed for my stay in London, being in Zone 1 and relatively near Paddington station. Breakfast wasn't very substantial, was offered toast by the waitress and self-service cereals and cheese, juice was running out by the time I arrived. very shabby unfriendly no bar or restrant to eat in had to go out side down staires to a indian ikea beds no duty manger on duty messages between staff not passed on spoilt our honeymoon wont go back My daugther and I want to spend some days in London, for sightseeing and shopping and musical, and we donÃÂ´t want to spend to much for hotel, but want to stay central. This hotel is just 300 m from Paddington station, clean an nice.,... good service, nice staff, ordinary breakfast inc..... But the hotel is very old and in a bad shape, the carpet is in a mess and the beds at terrible, we said to them when we left, that they should get some new madresses for the beds because they were to bad, my daugther are very thin, so we put a blanket folded in 6 layers under her, so she could sleep a bit better.... But all in all, cheap, clean an central. We donÃÂ´t hersitate to come back an other time.... I have come to london for a week, mostly for shopping! the reviews make this place look like a nightmare, although for the cost i think its pretty good. i will agree that its not top of the range, and you cant get much better. however, for me it was perfect. I spend most of my days outdoors, shopping, and just come back in the evening to sleep. I'd rather spend the money on shopping than on a posh hotel which im barely going to be in. The location is great! easy access to almost anything. some of the rooms are a bit small, while others are a little spacious. Although, they dont really have top of the range furniture. The bathrooms were clean and really nice.They also have wireless for only ÃÂ£3.99 per 12 hours. Service was good! i had a problem with the sink, when i got back it was all sorted out. Breakfast is standard, not much of variety but food tasted great. overall if your trip is for shopping and sightseeing i would strongly recommend this hotel; however, if your coming to london for relaxation and to stick around in the hotel, then this wouldn't be your best option. Put in a stuffy basement room with no windows to open. Deliveries came to the basement from very early morning the opening and closing of doors left the corridor very noisey. Next morning we went to the dining room again in the basement the staff did even say good morning we were left to fend for ourselves, the juice was warm the cereal was cheap and horrible then we asked for an english breakfast (which we had paid extra for) it too was horrible and we could not eat it, so had to go out and buy elsewhere. How this hotel ever passed the health and safety regulations I will never know, the wiring was a joke with trailing sockets everywhere. Wires were taped accross floors and hid under mats. On the plus side we were only there for 3 nights, it was somewere to sleep, the towels were fresh and clean and the location was good. Provided that you don't pay the full rack rate and are able to get a good discount on the room price then this is really an excellent place to stay when in London. Situated near Hyde Park, many attractions are within a reasonable walking distance. My room was very quiet although I suspect that may not have been the case elsewhere in the hotel. Breakfast was basic but adequate. I would definitely stay there again. I stayed here for the weekend. Very clean and staff very helpful. The room was small, but I did not spend much time in the room. The bathroom was also small, very clean and the shower was very good. Would give a thumbs up here. Travelling with a 5 year old daughter and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here, but we were pleasently surprised after arriving to the hotel. Room was clean and bathroom was nice. Breakfast ok: toast, cheese, cereals, juice , coffee/tea. I would go to this hotel again with my children.",,,

They have a bbq for you to use to cook dinner if you choose. The room was a room... Shower, bed. Nice they had a microwave, frig, and coffee maker in the room. My only draw back was the room needed a little deep cleaning... dusting of the fixtures and picture frames.... I finally took a wash cloth and did it my self... but maybe I am too picky. I loved the staff and were always friendly and kind. I will be staying here on my vacations to Hawaii in the future! Where to start. Reservations booked but when we arrived at check in time a 20 minute wait turned into two hours. Older motel but no excuse for what looks like hand me down furniture. Small room but furnishing allowed no movement when seated at desk. End table lamp on one side failed to work. Only one set of linen and promise to provide another set never happened. We paid $100 with a discount but advertised WiFi down and promises to restore never happened. Room lacked microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, and all the liitle things that make traveling enjoyable.

Took the light rail ($2.75) from airport to the West lake station (last stop) and walked with luggage the short 1/4 mile (easy walk) to the hotel. Very nice staff (we had a group of six that had a bottle of wine one in our group brought with while in the lobby visiting and they brought us 6 glasses so we could toast our trip). Service was outstanding! Rooms are very nice, quiet, eco smart design (you will see what I mean if you stay here). Great restaurants in the area and shopping (don't miss Nordstrums Rack down the street). Great bed, open shower but no tub which I guess is the norm here in Seattle.

I've been there many times in the last 8 years and to be honest never been disappointed. Avoid first or second floor rooms to the street side, and others close to the elevator on the other floor if you want to sleep peacefully. Otherwise, goor price/quality ratio, certainly in this ""arrondissement"". Breakfast of good quality, but you must enjoy having it in the basement. Excellent personnel. We stayed here for a couple of days before the Paris half marathon. Location excellent. hotel clean and comfortable, staff very helpful - allowed us a late departure for showering. breakfast simple but very sufficient. defintely a recommend Hotel clean and comfortable. Rooms quite spacious by Paris standards. Great position but not bothered by traffic noise due to the shutters. Hotel agreed to extending checkout by an hour despite claiming to be fully booked. Only complaint was the bed has seen better days. This hotel is in a great location. Stylish,spacious& clean rooms. Staff very helpful. We would stay there again...I can't wait to come back! There was a very nice gentleman in the breakfast room who noticed we had not made it down- so he called our room and said he had saved some croissants for us and he would bring them up with some coffee ect to our room. Now that was nice :). Le Lavoisier is the perfect place to feel ""home away from home"". Actually my home is pretty nice, and so is this charming small hotel. Staff are very helpful ( yes, even the new shy guy at reception did great in finding us champagne and two glasses for an early evening drink in the room : THANKS ). The rooms are average size but comfortable and very clean. We live about 2 hours outside of Paris and can recommand this as the perfect Parisien ""pied Ã  terre' : well located, nearby secure and clean parking, close to subway station. Oh, about breakfast : we LOVE breakfast during the week ( with fresh orange juice ..... ) but the Sunday team do not seem to have their act together .... we agree The Hotel Le Lavoisier is my hotel of choice either for business or pleasure. It is within easy walking distance of major tourist attractions without being a ""tourist"" hotel. The staff is very accommodating in scheduling any ground transportation as required. Suggest booking as early as possible to get the best pricing. I always stay in the hotel as it is very close to our office in Paris. Good option for 1-3 nights, altough I found the rooms quite small for the price you pay (200 Euro for standard room). Rooms are nicely furnished with a somewhat smallish flatscreen (maximum 26 inch I think). There is a small sitting-area and a library where you can use the bar. Breakfast is very limited in my opinion, some baquette, a croissant and a pain au chocolat. Some confiture, but no cheese, ham or anything. Breakfast room is in the basement. Overall ok for a few nights. I will stay there because it's so close to the office, otherwise I would prefer another more airy hotel, with a better breakfast when you pay 200 Euro/night. Just back from Paris and stayed at the La Lavoisier Hotel in the Opera district for 3 nights. We struggled to find a good hotel as many reviews had scared us about the poor quality of hotels at extortionate prices in Paris. We came across this hotel on ulookubook and due to the good reviews we thought we would give it a go. It was immediately a good impression, lovely facade and reception area. Bedrooms were also nicely decorated and quite large for Parisien hotel rooms. The rooms were clean with mostly everything you would need. Staff were quite friendly with good english. I would have liked to have an in room safe and tea/coffee making facilities as it was a 4 star hotel. The price was reasonable for Paris at just under Â£300 for 3 nights. The location was safe and close to some lovely restaurants and the metro. It was within 15 minutes walk from the Opera and Place de la Concord. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I stayed at this hotel 3 nights with my wife and my daughter Very nice and clean room, also quite large compared with other hotels in Paris. Helpful staff and good breakfast included in the rate. Located at walking distance from most important Paris beauties and shoppings. I highly recommend it. This was our second stay at this hotel. We love the location, price, decor and the friendly and helpful employees. Fabienne (absolutely adorable) has been there both times. Our grand-daughter who was with us on our first stay about 4 years ago, still talks about her. The Hotel was exactly what my fiance and I had in mind for our first trip to Paris. Located in a great location, on a quiet side street, near the main tourist sites and within walking distance of many shops and boutiques. The staff were all very accommodating, and breakfast was perfect, set in a cozy subterranean vault. We highly recommend for any reason or length stay in Paris! Huge (for Paris) room, great price, wonderful, attentive service and perfect Right Bank location for exploring. We were surprised how spacious and comfortable the rooms were for a boutique hotel in Paris! The rooms were clean and cosy. The staff from the reception to the breakfast room were exceptional, friendly and extremey helpful. The breakfast wasgood, but nothing special, cheese, fruits and pastries. The location was great, lots of restaurants and cafes right outside and only about half a block to the Metro. Trying to choose a room in Paris was surpriningly scary. We looked at all price ranges from $190. to $600., and alot of the higher priced ones had very negative reviews. My wife found this one and we were so happy with our choice. The rooms were not large but very tasteful, and plenty of room for my wife's excessive luggage! We were not looking for an ""american"" style hotel we wanted a Paris experience. We paid around $250.US and were very satisfied with the experience. The location although perhaps not perfect was great for us, we like to walk, and when you get tired the ""M"" is very close by. Don't be scared, the Metro is very easy to figure out, and will take you anywhere-quickly! If you like Italian food there is a great spot acroos the street around the corner!! If you can find it try ""Bugsy's"" for food and drink! It is close!! Thank You!! A warm welcome awaits you from reception, lovely clean rooms with pretty dÃ©cor. The location is perfect, situated in a quiet street yet close to metro, major shopping areas, easy walk to Champs ElysÃ©e and Eiffel Tower. Good restaurants and supermarket near by. I have stayed here twice and would stay again. My 12-year-old daughter and I stayed here for almost a week. The room was spacious and although it was on the street side the windows were so thick we heard nothing. All the people who worked at the hotel were amazingly helpful and informed. The location could not be better. We walked everywhere. We highly recommend two nearby restaurants - L'envue and Sushi World. Avoid Pepiniere, a nearby brassiere. We enjoyed the breakfast and it helped us start the sight-seeing day. If want large rooms with mini bars and electric kettles go and stay in one of the many branded chain hotels that may adequately cater for your needs. This is a small, friendly and very French hotel in a good location with a quiet understated elegance. The twin room that we had for two nights had most comfortable and beautifully dressed beds - it's size and ambience was in keeping with the location - traditional and very French. The latter extended to the bathroom - pristine with floors and tiles of marble, quality fittings, towels, soaps and shampoos. The reception staff are delightful, charming and helpful with fluent English that puts my poor French to shame! Breakfast is served in the basement - a small intimate room - a good selection of breads and croissants with attendant jams and honey etc, together with set yoghurt and orange juice. You can also get cooked breakfast if you prefer. Other guests were present when we were eating were French, Belgian and Italian. I will return. We have visited Paris to spend christmas holidays. We chose the Lavoisier as opinions were quite good and rooms seemed to be very nice. Rooms were small, bathroom so simple, as toiletries. It was comfortable, clean and extremely well-located. In any case, if you find a good rate and you find good location, this is a good election but don't trust completely in the photos as they seem more that really they are.",,,

It was cold during our stay, the heater was loud and cold. They should replace the air conditioner. Overall, we won't go back... This place was so cute - not your usual hotel. The parking was separated from the rooms with a grove of bamboo and lots of potted plants, with teak table and chairs outside the room. The rooms had hard wood floors although a bit small. Breakfast was good and everyone working there was very nice. We were very pleased with the location so close to Balboa park. After travelling for four weeks through the United States, we didn't want a to end a great stay in this country in a cheap city hotel. So, we decided to book a Best Western Plus, thinking that the plus meant that this is a upgrade on the usual Best Western standard. During the four weeks in the USA we had used a lot of Best Western hotels and that resultated in a promotion in their awards programme from Gold to Platinum. When we arrived the Platinum status wasn't in their booking, so I had to ask for the welcome-packet for Platinum members. Next, we didn't get the upgrade in the room that usually belongs to a Platinum status in a loyalty programme. The room we got, was small, but clean. The breakfast was average and the hotel didn't have a pool. So, we could not see what was ""plus"" in this hotel. We have stayed in much better Best Western hotels during our trip that didn't have the ""plus-status"". Finally, we wanted a late check-out at 5.30 pm, because our plane left San Diego at 8 pm that night. We had to pay a charge of $75 for keeping the room for another couple of hours, although one of the benefits the Best Western Rewards programme offers to Platinum members is a late check-out upon availabilty. And the room was available, because the hotel was virtually empty the day we left San Diego. So in all, a bit disappointing. The member of staff was the only real plus to the Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn. He was nice and helpful. Had a four night stay at the Cabrillo in early May 2010. The room was extremely clean, so much so that we had to keep the windows open to let the cleaning fragrance escape! I guess you should never complain about a place being too clean. The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San DiegoÃ¢â¬â¢s centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was $150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western. Still, I would recommend this hotel if you didnÃ¢â¬â¢t mind being just out of the very centre of the city. This is my first Trip Advisor review. I came here for a convention. I usually try to stay a mile or so away from the venue so I can experience the town, with a different street walked on each trip to and fro. Cabrillo Inn suits the bill for similarly disposed conventioneers. As to the property, I fell in love when I first drove up. It was a simple oasis in the big city. Lots and lots and lots of potted plants provide character and privacy. Little lanterns illuminating the property. Charming in an uncomplicated way but that does not come without effort---the property was well tended to. The room was clean and I really enjoyed the hand stenciling in the rooms--so homey. The rooms were definitely not large though they were functional--a desk for using the computer (both ethernet and wireless at a decent rate of speed), a round table with chairs if you take a meal in room, and a very comfortable bed. Slept like a baby. Screened windows open up to bring a little of the outside in. Nice breakfast with food choices and nice staff. It also afforded me the opportunity to find some off the track restaurants outside of the Gaslamp Quarter. I stayed here six nights and will stay here again. After a two night stay we're still not sure whether the pluses outweigh the minuses here. The facility is older, but well-maintained, two stories, no elevator, downtown & close to the freeway with associated traffic noise. It's clean, but the strong odor of some cleaner / freshener product took some getting used to. Bedding was comfortable. Staff was pleasant. Parking is an extra $10.00 per day . Breakfast included scrambled eggs and sausage one day, scrambled eggs and hm the other, along with the usual ""continental"" breakfast fare. Orange juice was watered down some and the only juice available the two mornings we were there. Dining area is cramped - we at at a table outdoors both mornings. I don't think our room (#215 above the office) was typical. Although fairly spacious, it was the most awkwardly arranged room we've ever stayed in. TV situated at an angle and distant from the bed, nowhere to sit near the phone, bath towels hung about 8 feet from the tub, no counter space in the bathroom, etc. (see pictures). The free Internet connects via provided ethernet cable which, fortunately, is long enough to string across the room to a good-sized table. The air conditioning took a little time to figure out but worked well and quietly. I can't say we wouldn't stay here again, but will thoroughly explore other options first. Best little hotel in the heart of San Diego. Nothing fancy just really clean with the most courteious staff to be found. Free breakfast every morning. I stay there whenever I'm in town. Close to Little Italy and the Gaslamp District.",,,
TRTW,76790,"I was on a budget and was looking for a place to stay while in L.A. Fortunately, I found this place at a very reasonable price. Arriving late at night I notice the parking lot was FULL. I mean, my car could only move in one direction as the cars were too close to one another. They may have had a group staying in the hotel that night. The check-in clerk was nice and showed me where to park (in between two handicap spaces that said 'NO PARKING'). I was worried I would get a ticket but the clerk said it's only for one night. The room was nice. It had all the basic necessities one needs. I like how there were a lot of TV stations and the Internet connection was fast. Early in the morning I went down to get breakfast and the room was very small. Food selection was ok but opted to eat at a restaurant that served breakfast. I toured L.A. for the day and upon my return to the room it was clean. HOWEVER, I realized the cleaning staff took all my soap away and forgot to replace them. So at 10 p.m., I went downstairs to the lobby and asked for soap. I got a facial soap (as that's what was left). I had to use this small facial soap in taking a shower. Anyway, I gave this place a Very Good rating because the room was overall comfortable, the price was reasonable, and it was close to the freeway (to get to where I want).

By the way, if you plan to use the pool it's very small. I chose the Best Western Plus Elm House Inn because of its TripAdvisor recommendations. I'm glad I made the right choice - thanks reviewers!!! Upon arrival we were greeted immeditately and the lady at the front desk was so nice in explaining what to do in and around Napa Valley - where to go, what to see/do. She explained to us what the property offers and when breakfast/cookie time was. She even gave us a coupon good for wine tasting around Napa Valley. The room was COMFORTABLE and CHARMING. It goes hand in hand. I actually like the yellow/blue motif. The yellow was not too loud, which I like. It really felt like a Bread & Breakfast and it had a wonderful, but small, garden in between. Internet connection was free (even though there were times it was slow) and all amenties were provided. The hotel's lobby is cozy, with a working fireplace and a little area where you can grab a book to read or play board games - yes, they have board games. Like I said, this hotel is like a Bed & Breakfast. Breakfast included oatmeal, fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, bread, waffles, yogurt, and juice. They made the waffles for you and they brought it to your table. The location was ideal and it's a perfect place to unwind and visit downtown. Would visit again. I decided to take a day trip to San Francisco to get my mind off my Persian cat who died. I was fortunate to find a room at the Parc 55 Wyndham downtown. Upon driving up they assisted with parking my car (parking is $48 a night). When I registered I requested a room away from the elevator/stairwell and they gave me a room just a few steps from the elevator. I thought that was hilarious. Anyway, I called again and requested if there was another room or perhaps an upgrade. They immediately transferred me to a room away from the elevator. Upon entering the room I quickly noticed the windows lined up along the right side. They gave me a corner room!!! The panoramic view of San Francisco is amazingly beautiful!!! Talk about a million dollar view...WOW!!! This made up for all the inconsistencies of my initial room I had requested. The staff at Parc 55 are helpful and attentive. The only issue I had was when I went to breakfast and the two ladies at the front kept reading something instead of seating us. Until my partner mentioned if we are to be seated and that's when they did. To me, no matter how busy you are, knowing that there was someone waiting, they should at least say ""Hold on, we will seat you shortly"". Instead, they saw us, ignored us, and continued doing what they were doing. Thought that was strange. But the service in the restaurant was exceptional. The registration/checkout was good too. The comfort of the bed is impeccable. The bathroom is in good working quality. I will definitely stay at this hotel. Found my home away from home. Plus, it got my mind off the sadness of losing my baby Persian cat.","I was on a budget and was looking for a place to stay while in L.A. Fortunately, I found this place at a very reasonable price.

By the way, if you plan to use the pool it's very small. Avoid this place like the plague! Not only is it well past its prime, but our room was infested with bedbugs. I was attacked by bedbugs, so I called the desk, and showed the night manager the many bugs in my bed as well as my bites and the bloody sheets. She sent us to another room, which was not made up. We finally got a third room and after another shower spent a fitful, basically sleepless night. The bites were severe enough that they required medical attention when I returned home, certainly not what I expected. I understand that bedbugs can infest even the most upscale hotels, but I expect the management to deal with problems quickly and competently. It took many e-mails and unreturned phone calls to the manager to finally get a vouchefr for a free night. This was not satisfactory to me, so I called the Best Western customer relations department and was credited with 20,000 points. I thought the points were in addition to the free night, as I would never have accepted one free night for the pain and inconvenience I suffered. When I tried to use the voucher at a subsequent stay at another Best Western, I learned that the Eagle Rock had cancelled it. So much for taking care of customers. There would have been no amount of money I could have been paid to stay in this hotel had I known I would be eaten alive by bedbugs. I thought the voucher plus the points was barely satisfactory, but by that point I was tired of the weeks of hastle. I guess the Eagle Rock management thinks letting you stay free if you're attacked as I was is enough. If you're willing to be bitten by bedbugs to get a free night (and that only after persistent phone calls and e-mails), the Eagle Rock is the place for you. Otherwise, I suggest you find someplace else. Almost anywhere else would be an improvement. My wife and I stayed here when our price was accepted on Priceline. I was able to upgrade to a King size bed at no additional cost. The room was a bit dated, but had a large flat screen tv, refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The bed was fairly comfortable. The down sides to the room was that there was a huge mirror on one wall, next to the bed. This might be a plus for some, but I didn't appreciate it at all. Another down side was that the air conditioning had to run all night to cool the room down. Suggestion would be to arrive early if you can, and turn it on before you go out for the evening. Breakfast-I have seen reviews that were positive. We did not have that experience. Yes,they had waffles, toaster waffles. not fresh. The breakfast room was very small with minimal seating. There were guests there that took up all the space and I had to reach around them often to get food that I had left on the counter. They ran out of decaf coffee, orange juice and the milk was hidden in the refrigerator. We would have had a more relaxing and enjoyable breakfast somewhere else, but since it was included in the room price, it was okay. Went to IKEA in Burbank later and got a good cup of coffee there before shopping! I would probably stay at this motel again, it was quiet, despite being right next to a freeway, but would probably skip the breakfast. I didn't have a need to use the WiFi so I can't comment on that. . Overall, this hotel is in a busy area...but it wasn't too bad. My only complaint was needing the computer for my work. It is for customer's use (sitting at the front desk)...and the employee at the front desk always has it facing towards them so they can do stuff on it. It got a little old constantly having to ask them if I could use it...since I am paying for it. Nice & deep pool, good sized hot tub. Breakfast is pretty bleak...but better than nothing. The hallways are outdoor hallways, but it helps that they have an elevator. If you are looking for a decent stay and an affordable rate, this place will do!",,,

It is an older hotel which has been renovated. Guy at check in was really nice and upgraded us to a club room. We asked for a late checkout and he gave us until 3 pm for free. Hotel is quite big and busy, the check in and checkout desks get quite busy but they work hard to get to you. There are staff everywhere to attend to you so itâs never a problem, do realize the hotel has quite a number of rooms. Rooms are nice, bed is a little hard but good. Bathroom is ok, but I was never fan of shower in bath though. Pool is quite shallow but very nice, just the sun is blocked by the two hotel towers so get there 10:30 to noon or later in the arvo if you want to get some sun. Breakfast is crazy, we walked down to a huge queue, but don't panic the line moves very fast. The breakfast is a huge array of items for all tastes from Asian to western breakfast. My girlfriend loved the location as right on Orchard road with the shops. She was in heaven as H&M and TopShop were right on the same block -- we don't get them in Australia. I broke my laptop screen while there, and the concierge was really nice and sourced a spare computer monitor for me to use for a further two days of my stay. The hotel has a bar on level 5 which made some really nice Singapore slings. Better than Raffels. The gym is ok, itâs in a temporary location so the guy said it will be a better fit out when it is moved to itâs new location. The staff here is wonderful !

Stayed in Maya Hotel during 2011 F1 Grand Prix weekend. Hotel is pretty basic but good value for money. I traveled alone. Got a room with a double bed without an extra charge. Staff was helpful when I had questions how to get around Istanbul and how to get to the racetrack. I got free pick-up from the airport. If I had booked 5 days, I would get a free drop-off to the airport. I managed to go back to the airport by using metro (10 minute walk from the hotel). Rooms are a bit small. This wasn't a problem for me as I was single. I could imagine it would be crowded if I was traveling with someone and staying in the same room. Walls are a bit thin. This wasn't a big problem except for one night when my Japanese neighbors decided to have loud conversation at 1am. Few knocks on the wall solved this. Breakfast was nice, although I'm not that picky when it comes to food. Location is fine. The hotel is 5min walk and the 2 or 3 stops by tram from historical sites. Taksim area is a bit further away, but easily reachable by public transport and/or walk. Valens Aqueduct is nearby. Also a couple of Mosques. If I ever go to Istanbul again, I would probably try to be closer to Taksim square if possible. I found myself going to Taksim area more often than not because of good choice of cheap restaurants and cafes. There are restaurants and cafes close to Maya, but I found them a bit overpriced. To summarize: I doubt I would find a better hotel for the money I paid. There are certainly hotels better located, with better rooms and service, but they cost more. Maya hotel is a good compromise between all these factors. We stayed here as part of a package while in Istanbul for the F1 Grand Prix. It is a basic 3 star hotel may be old, but is clean. Staff were lovely even though English is not readily spoken. Breakfast provided is an European breakfast so do not expect bacon & eggs. You will get cheese, bread, salad etc though there was usually 1 hot dish. We didn't find the walk to the Bazaar too long, probably about 15 -20 minutes. It is also close to several restaurants and taxis are plentiful. It didn't appear that the upstair bar opens so no sitting at the hotel for a quiet drink",,,
talonglang,1187163,"I love this hotel! I think this is the most worth it hotel I have ever stayed in Hong Kong. We got the early bird rate and got our rooms at a cheaper rate. A few days before our scheduled check in, I already received an e-mail from them giving us a weather update and asking for confirmation of our check in time. I got several concerns and they responded swiftly and granted my request for a double bed. When we got to the hotel at around 8 a.m. , we were fortunate that we were allowed to check in early as there was already a room available. I loved the scent of the hotel in the lobby. When we got to the room, we were amazed by the glass wall with view. The curtains were electronic and provided a good shade if you want your room to be dark. The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was small but very strategically located that moving around does not seem to be a problem. The water pressure and heater were also working great! The airconditioner and tv in the room were also working well! But I must say the aisle and area for elevators are so cold. The best feature of the hotel for me is its free shuttle service to and from the Kowloon Station (very convenient transpo to and from the airport), Tsim Sha Tsui area (China Ferry Terminal) and Mong Kok Station (Drop off at Langham Place). Of course you have to be on time, or better be there ten minutes before the scheduled time of the shuttle to make sure you donât miss it. The shuttle arrives on the drop off points on the dot or earlier. The staff and service should be well commended because they make sure their guests feel special and taken care of. Also, the hotel is very conveniently located in front of Mcdonalds and a lot of other good places to eat. We ate at Dumpling Kitchen across Tai Kok Tsui Road and a very busy Chinese restaurant nearby. Both restaurants served great dumplings and Chinese food, very tasty and authentic! We stayed in Marina Bay Sands and all I can say is that it's pretty good but definitely not the best (maybe I'm just biased after we experienced Ritz Carlton). The rooms were okay, just enough space for moving around. The bed and pillows are comfortable enough. The amenities were so so. Of course it boasts of its infinity pool at its topmost floor. It's a different experience swimming 50 floors up a building but I really didn't find it appealing as it was always crowded. All in all, I say I expected a little bit more. I had a thought that it's overrated. Again, the rooms were okay. I think other hotels can offer the same feel with a lower price. But then again, only Marina Bay offers swimming closer to heaven. What you pay for is what you get. We arrived in HK at around 2 a.m. and we needed a cheap and accessible place to spend the remainder of the night while we wait for the check in at another (better) hotel at 12 noon. I chose this place because it was the closest to Cosmo Hotel Mongkok. To enter the hotel, you have to go through a restaurant with white French windows and doors. After the counter/bar of the restaurant, thereâs a managerâs room. I donât know if that was the reception already. Anyway, the receptionist confirmed our room booking and then gave us the room keys, remote control, adaptor and aircon remote control. When we got to the room, it was really small compared to other accommodations. From the reviews I read here, I was expecting a very clean and cozy room. I must admit I was a bit disappointed. Though the bed and bathroom seem clean, the white walls have become dirty because of luggage scratches or marks or dirty fingerprints. The room was just really enough for a double bed and a 1 Â½ aisle for the chair. The bathroom was clean but again, very tiny. You cannot even stretch your hand sideways when youâre showering. The sink and toilet bowl are also closely placed to each other. I liked the hardness of the bed and the pillows were just fine. The comforter seemed clean too. Though the bathroom had a funky smell at first (maybe due to the small space and lack of ventilation), it was pretty decent because the sink and bowl were white so it seemed clean. The water pressure and temperature were also redeeming factors for this place. The aircon provided good temperature and there was also a tv which we werenât able to use because the remote control is broken. All in all, if you are just looking for a place to sleep in and on a tight budget, Bridal Tea House is okay. But if you are a bit big like for Westerners, I think you will have a hard time moving in here because the place is really small. I have never experienced luxury at its finest. Ritz Carlton offers luxurious and comfortable accommodation. From our arrival to our check out, we have been treated like royalties by the courteous and efficient staff. As soon as we entered our room, we were amazed by the view and the elegance exuded by the room. The bed, pillows and comforters were just great. I can bury myself and sleep there the whole day. I even wanted to ask where they buy that kind of bed and what kind of pillow they use, I want to buy and get that comfort every night. The bathroom is perfect! It has a separate control for music and it's fantastic while relaxing at the tub with an awesome view of the city. Needless to say, this is the best hotel I've stayed in so far. However, since it's so great, the rate is also great that I think I wouldn't spend for again unless I have extra to spare for luxurious accommodation.","As we didn't expect much from the HK accomodation, Bridal Tea House was just fine. For the price you pay you get a clean room, which is really small but this is an issue fro almost all HK hotels. Bathroom was really clean and included a hi/tech shower with radio and steamer. In the time we were staying the hotel was just undergoing some reconstruction work, which made the entrance a little bit harder to find, but as we didn't spend much time inside it didn't bother us at all. Wifi is working only in the reception floor. Receptionist was very helpful on the day of our departure, he did store our luggage in the reception area for he whole day and gave us the right directions for the bus as well. If you are coming form the HK airport and want to save some dollars, you can use a public bus E21 going from right in front of the airport. It takes around 50 min to the Tai kok Tsui and cost HK$14. There is a space where to put your luggage and from the top deck you can enjoy the ride with a spectacular view. Get off the bus the one before last station. 5 mins walk to olympian city mtr about 200 metres.. that line not very useful unless u don't mind transit. walk to mongkok is 11 minutes, i walk everyday, so i find it alright. especially weather is about 25degs. taxi to mongkok is always 20hkd, < 25hkd. to mongkok east mtr is 30hkd. toilet doors and rooms doors shutting is a big concern if u wake after 10 am, i am constatnly awoken during that timings, as neighbours take lifts, visit the toilets so frequently, the previous stay at sham shui po bridal tea house was much better What you pay for is what you get.

This hotel is quite near to the Olympic mtr with 10 - 15 mins walking distance. The hotel is surrounded by all the workshop where the walkway is slightly greasy. But overall still bearable. The hotel room is small but clean and cozy. It is equipped with basic neccessities such as hair dryer, refrigerator and TV. Toiletries and towel are provided too. We booked a standard twin room, and was being upgrade to family room which can accommodate 3 person. Even though the room have one double bed and one single bed, but the double bed is at the size of a super single bed. The single bed is really small! One thing i don't like about the hotel is that they have really bad sound proof! Every night we can hear people talking loud, bang the room doors and the sound where people moving chairs. It is really irritating! Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful. The huge Olympian mall is just 10 mins away from the hotel with walking distance, where the mall is just beside the Olympic Mtr station. The mall have 3 phases which can actually link to Mongkok too. Overall, the hotel is quite good, I Will come back again. The hotel is in an area of Hong Kong that I would say ""had character"". It is in what I would expect the stereotypical Hong Kong street to be prior to the tourist age. The staff, although unable to speak anything but the barest English, were very friendly and helpful. When necessary, they would get the boss on the phone to translate. We arrived in Hong Kong early in the morning, and they allowed us to drop our bags and took good care of them whilst we were out for the day. The rooms (we had two) were both very comfortable and homely. Price was great, and the hotel is only ten minutes' walk from Olympic station. When arriving, don't be put off by the street - entry is through the restaurant on the ground floor. If you walk in and call out, someone will greet you.",,,

The rooms are a little bit old-fashioned and dark but clean. Breakfast is very simple, serve in plastic cups/plates. The breakfast room is very small and not very inviting to stay there. Construction of walls very thin, quite load from neighbour rooms and street. room doors don't close entirely, therefore also noise from outside. I would recommend this hotel for its location but I think its too expensive for what you get. Location is good, staff were friendly, breakfast was good. But room was humid and small with thin walls.

The rooms had hard wood floors although a bit small. Breakfast was good and everyone working there was very nice. We were very pleased with the location so close to Balboa park. After travelling for four weeks through the United States, we didn't want a to end a great stay in this country in a cheap city hotel. So, we decided to book a Best Western Plus, thinking that the plus meant that this is a upgrade on the usual Best Western standard. During the four weeks in the USA we had used a lot of Best Western hotels and that resultated in a promotion in their awards programme from Gold to Platinum. When we arrived the Platinum status wasn't in their booking, so I had to ask for the welcome-packet for Platinum members. Next, we didn't get the upgrade in the room that usually belongs to a Platinum status in a loyalty programme. The room we got, was small, but clean. The breakfast was average and the hotel didn't have a pool. So, we could not see what was ""plus"" in this hotel. We have stayed in much better Best Western hotels during our trip that didn't have the ""plus-status"". Finally, we wanted a late check-out at 5.30 pm, because our plane left San Diego at 8 pm that night. We had to pay a charge of $75 for keeping the room for another couple of hours, although one of the benefits the Best Western Rewards programme offers to Platinum members is a late check-out upon availabilty. And the room was available, because the hotel was virtually empty the day we left San Diego. So in all, a bit disappointing. The member of staff was the only real plus to the Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn. He was nice and helpful. Had a four night stay at the Cabrillo in early May 2010. The room was extremely clean, so much so that we had to keep the windows open to let the cleaning fragrance escape! I guess you should never complain about a place being too clean. The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San Diegoâs centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was $150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western. Still, I would recommend this hotel if you didnât mind being just out of the very centre of the city. This is my first Trip Advisor review. I came here for a convention. I usually try to stay a mile or so away from the venue so I can experience the town, with a different street walked on each trip to and fro. Cabrillo Inn suits the bill for similarly disposed conventioneers. As to the property, I fell in love when I first drove up. It was a simple oasis in the big city. Lots and lots and lots of potted plants provide character and privacy. Little lanterns illuminating the property. Charming in an uncomplicated way but that does not come without effort---the property was well tended to. The room was clean and I really enjoyed the hand stenciling in the rooms--so homey. The rooms were definitely not large though they were functional--a desk for using the computer (both ethernet and wireless at a decent rate of speed), a round table with chairs if you take a meal in room, and a very comfortable bed. Slept like a baby. Screened windows open up to bring a little of the outside in. Nice breakfast with food choices and nice staff. It also afforded me the opportunity to find some off the track restaurants outside of the Gaslamp Quarter. I stayed here six nights and will stay here again. After a two night stay we're still not sure whether the pluses outweigh the minuses here. The facility is older, but well-maintained, two stories, no elevator, downtown & close to the freeway with associated traffic noise. It's clean, but the strong odor of some cleaner / freshener product took some getting used to. Bedding was comfortable. Staff was pleasant. Parking is an extra $10.00 per day . Breakfast included scrambled eggs and sausage one day, scrambled eggs and hm the other, along with the usual ""continental"" breakfast fare. Orange juice was watered down some and the only juice available the two mornings we were there. Dining area is cramped - we at at a table outdoors both mornings. I don't think our room (#215 above the office) was typical. Although fairly spacious, it was the most awkwardly arranged room we've ever stayed in. TV situated at an angle and distant from the bed, nowhere to sit near the phone, bath towels hung about 8 feet from the tub, no counter space in the bathroom, etc. (see pictures). The free Internet connects via provided ethernet cable which, fortunately, is long enough to string across the room to a good-sized table. The air conditioning took a little time to figure out but worked well and quietly. I can't say we wouldn't stay here again, but will thoroughly explore other options first. Best little hotel in the heart of San Diego. Nothing fancy just really clean with the most courteious staff to be found. Free breakfast every morning. I stay there whenever I'm in town. Close to Little Italy and the Gaslamp District.",,,
vecareca,84296,The hotel was ok. The personal is nice. The pool is clean. Rooms kind of old and messy but still ok. The internet is very good I have been in this hotel many times. I will return again as the price is very good. Do not look for luxury there as the hotel is to sleep in only.,"The hotel was ok. The personal is nice. The pool is clean. Rooms kind of old and messy but still ok. The internet is very good Concierge was very helpful and friendly. Location was excellent for the Coconut Grove Arts Festival. Hotel was only 10 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from the beach. Coral Gables is a beautiful little city and we were walking distance from the downtown commercial area. There was also a trolley available (for free) right in front of the hotel which we took to the downtown area of the city and all over Ponce de Leon which was the main boulevard off the hotel. Overall...a cozy little place. The hotel is actually in Coral Gables but still close enough to Coconut Grove and downtown Miami Bayfront & Bayside Park! With that said, the traveling experience was made easier for our celebrations and it was everything we hoped for....a great new years 2012! What we did not hope for was to have our reservation go from a king size bedroom to a double bedroom! It allowed us to bring our maltese but were limited to the bottom floor and double beds in every room! Don't misunderstand that it's great that the hotel is pet friendly, but I should have been told I'm paying for a king but getting a double! Happy New Year!! My room smelled like an armpit, there were springs poking through the matress, the AC unit was off when I arrived, the room was about 80 degrees, and the unit is not powerful enough to cool it down, it isn't close to anything, the wall paper is peeling off of the walls. It's maybe the second worst place I've ever stayed at and I'm a budget traveller. I stayed there back in 2007. Hope I Never See That Place Again. Rude People, Filthy Room, the Best I can Say about the Hotel is: ""The Beer Was Cold"" But, so were the Waiters and Waitress' and the Majority of the employees working there. BAD NEW JOINT. I have one other thing I would like to tell You future Customers, but I don't want to GROSS YOU OUT and Perhaps You Would Not Believe Me.. SARGE, US Army Airborne, Retired, San Pedro Sula, Honduras A few friends and I traveled to Miami to attend Ultrafest music festival. We needed to find a place to stay just for a night. Most hotels located downtown Miami were more than $400 per night. This hotel provided a good bargain for the services offered. Our room was spacious, clean and had a great balcony overlooking Ponce de Leon Blvd. Some of the furniture was slightly outdated, but overall the staff was very accommodating and if I needed a place to stay near Miami again I would go back.",,,

Here's the real scoop: -Small rooms - true. But not far off from a typical NYC hotel room. -Rooms also have thin walls, no doubt. But, unless you get stuck with crazy neighbors, you are probably OK. We had a neighbor who occasionally let off a scream (assume she had bad dreams?) but no points docked for the hotel for this. =) -Beds are standard. Nothing to write home about, but sufficient after a long day of walking the city. -Staff - all friendly, varying levels of English speaking. Most very hospitable. Actually it is the owner of the hotel who was the least welcoming during the stay (dare I say grumpy old man). -Breakfast is on the top level, enclosed. Includes cheeses, meats, some pastries and a variety of spreads. Apple Tea and coffee included. Nice view from here. -Location is excellent for sight seeing such as the ""blue mosque"" and others nearby. Grand Bazaar, subway/tram station, restaurants, all within a hop skip and jump of the hotel. -Tip: A subway/tram ride from IST airport is about $2US, 90 minute ride, including one transfer of trains. Not a bad deal! Your return trip, can purchase a shared bus ride for $7US from the local travel agency across the hotel. Overall the hotel is average. There are many - MANY hotels in this and surrounding areas. Do your homework. Consider this among others. It provides a decent stay for a relatively good price, in a location excellent for sightseeing. One more note: The Musim prayers are 5X a day in IST. The proximity of the Mosque's to the hotel mean at 6am loud...LOUD prayers are broadcast for the entire neighborhood to hear. Even the soundest sleeper should be prepared for a 6am ""wake up call"". This may not be different from other hotels nearby other mosque's/loud speakers. - very small room, Small beds, Constarction going on, Service is zero, No one speaks english, breakfast is a desaster morning to a beautiful breakfast terrace enjoying the cool wind is an incredible sea views good service friendly staff and comfortable rooms are full 24-hour in a hotel My boyfriend and I had a great experience at this hotel! The staff, Ibrahim especially, was extremely cordial and helpful, the rooms were small and clean, the breakfast buffet was good (even wonderful, compared to the other ones we've been to in Turkey), and the roof top had an amazing view of the city (you can look over the Marmara when you eat breakfast). A great location from which to explore Istanbul's Sultanahmet sites. If you're interested in spending time on the European side, however, this is a pretty far walk, so you might want to stay at a place closer to the Golden Horn. Clean rooms. Well positioned for Sultanahmet sites - Able to walk around the district in the evenings undisturbed. ( apart from routine Istanbul touting - excessive) Pleasant staff. Prepare for the difference between advertised room price, 'special offers' & front of desk arrival banter ( cash - no cash/credit cards) - for a lethargic receipt and reluctant/non return (assumed as 'tip' before you have the chance to suggest/decide that option) of the change. Definitely 'no frills' - bring own mini toiletries etc. Meals ho hum. We stayed for 4 days in Abella Hotel in Istanbul! Again! It is the second time, in the same hotel. I think we will come here again the next time. The hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the old city, everything is within walking distance. The hotel is situated in a quiet neighborhood near the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia Museum, Topkapi PalaceÃ¢â¬Â¦ The service is excellent. The staff is very friendly especially Mr.ÃÂ°BRAHEM. The staff can help with directions, guides, tours. The rooms are not that big, but comfortable. The cleanliness is excellent.

So glad to see the sisters still are still providing such gracious hospitality. It is the perfect location in the heart of the city. Near Campo de Fiori and within walking distance of the Vatican. A perfect place to relax at the end of a busy travel day. We stayed here for 3 nights in February. The location can not be beat, steps off Campo de Fiori but worlds away in terms of noise and crowds. The roof deck has a spectacular view of city, I highly recommend going up there. All the sisters were very helpful and it seemed like they all spoke English. The convent was recommended to us by a friend who frequents Rome and we read about it in Rick Steves. I should note that none of the rooms have a bed for two, at best its two singles pushed together. The centralized location without being part of the tourist crowd was by far the best part of Casa di Santa Brigida. This was recommended to me by a cousin who lives in Rome. I was expecting a simple place, nothing special, but safe for a solo traveler. I was surprised in many ways. The common areas in this convent are really beautiful, even the areas around the elevators are simple but so well done. My room was large and comfortable with antique furniture and a great view of the piazza. ( which did allow for some noise at night) The roof deck is incredible. I have never stayed ANYWHERE that was so clean. Honestly, I think you could eat off of the floors. The roof deck is beautiful. The breakfast was just okay, but adequate. You are safe here. It was a memorable experience staying at Santa Brigita in a good location. The garden top was beautiful and a must see, but I did have to make arrangments in advance to go there at dawn. Sister corrected my Italian, which I appreciated and made me smile - just like my Catholic School days. I went to Mass in the beautiful chapel. Lovely place. We were not in the convent most of the time, but you do feel a bit confined; (like you are in a convent)! I guess that's to be expected. It is exciting when you think that you are staying in a building from the 13 century where St. Bridget lived. Plan ahead to book a room, see St. Bridget's room, go on the beautiful rooftop, go to Mass with the nuns if you are so inclined. Stayed here on a recent 3 night stay in Rome at the recommendation of Rick Steve's guidebook. He was very accurate in his description. While staying in this convent, you would never guess that you were in the middle of an incredibly busy, chaotic and noisy city. The convent itself was beautifully decorated, cool and quiet. The room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. Beds (two singles, no doubles or queens here) were very comfortable. Shower was a little small, so if you are a big person this could be an issue. Very quiet, except for Friday night when Rome was in full party mode, so slept very well in general. Breakfasts were delicious (fresh fruit, cereal, juice, coffee, meats and cheese) and the sisters were very kind and helpful. Rooftop terrace overlooking Piazza Farnese and the city of Rome was great for relaxing before dinner. Although, it may sound strange, one of the best things about staying here was the feeling of safety provided in a not always so safe city. Location may have been the best part of staying here. On beautiful Piazza Farnese and right next to Campo di Fiori with its plentiful restaurants, fresh fruit and vegetable markets during the day and active nightlife. Also, within walking distance of all of the tourist attractions including ancient Rome and the Vatican. Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again if returning to Rome. Overall, the hotel was OK. Because the hotel is run by nuns, at times their attitudes become an issue. It also meant that their schedule dictated when you could do things like settle the bill and have breakfast (8 am - 9 am, unless special arrangements are made). I have travelled primarily as a single since 2006, and the single room (NUMBER 23) they put me in initially measured less than 11 feet by 11 feet, inlcuding the microscopic bathroom. The twin bed was the worst I'd slept in since 1974, It had a slope and a trough, which made sleeping difficult. The shower curtain was a joke, and toilet paper and a lot of other stuff got wet from the morning shower. They put me into number 19 the next day, and the room and bathroom were much larger and better organized. Be aware that the rooms don't have TV, and the TV in the lounge doesn't get any English-speaking channels. The hotel also does not provide room safes, and you must ask to use a hair dryer or get more soap or shampoo. Breakfast is adequate - coffee, rolls, jam, cold cuts, yogurt. The hotel is well situated right off the Piazza Farnese and a couple blocks from the Campo de' Fiori. The Campo is a lot of fun, with a ton of pricey restaurants nearby. (If you want reasonably priced food, go to 33 Gubbonari to Voglia Pizzaria Spaghetteria.) The hotel's site and cleanliness enable it to get very high room rates. Save you initial emails from the hotel, as they raised the rates 10 euros/night per room between when we reserved and when we checked out. There was a lot of noise outside the hotel during the weekend. The hotel is pretty with a lot of period furniture and antiques. This just doesn't help at all in the comfort of the rooms. The roof top terrace is pleasant in the evening. We had been staying in the Casa a number of times, first time in 1972. We always tried to get a reservation when we were in Rome. It was charming. Last time we went, everything was still the same - beds and all. We were stuck in a small room with no shower. Couldn't work the hand held one and showered the bathroom. We asked to be moved to a room with a shower, and they begrudgingly moved us - to an even smaller room that hardly fit our 2 suitcases. There was a little portable shower in the corner of the bathroom, but it was so small you couldn't bend down to pick up the soap. The nuns were quite upset with us for wanting to use their computer to check our Email (we had urgent business coming in each day). They ended up charging us quite a bit for its usage as we checked out. The cost of the room was on a par with some 4 star hotels - out of line for what you get. All in all it lost its charm for us. Beautiful convent. I stayed 4 nights in November and had the best experience. The convent is immaculately clean. The location can't be beat and was walking distance to all the major sites with many good restaurants nearby. The nuns were incredibly kind. Would stay here again if I go back to Rome. We stayed 3 nights during our recent trip to Rome and chose a Convent for the unique experience. Since we are Catholic and have priests in the family, we felt at home. The room was lovely, overlooking the Piazza Farnese, close to the Campo di Fiori. It was very comfortable (twin beds). Sr Gertrude went above and beyond to make our stay the best, arranging for us to have an early breakfast to accommodate our travel plans. She gave us a little tour of the Chiesa Santa Brigida, including the rooms the Saint occupied and some of their relics. It was really inspiring. When the laundry forgot my husband's pants, she made sure they got sent to us! We hope to go back some day! My wife and I have been in the travel business for over thirty years. I traveled with my daughter and teenage grandson to Rome and stayed at the Casa di Santa Brigida five days. What can I say? It is the very best deal going. The place is run by a group of lovely nuns. As expected, the place is spotless. It is in an old Palazzo located on the Piazza Farnese directly adjacent to the French Embassy. The location cannot be beat: walk to Campo dei Fiori, Piazza Navona, Vatican, Trastevere, Pantheon, etc. Breakfast was perfect and lunch and dinner is possible, though we did not do that. Sisters are extremely helpful and knowledgeable of Rome. You can access them by going to the order's home page at /www.brigidine.org and click on accommodations. Note that they also have other accommodations in about fifteen other countries. This is a great place to stay in Rome, especially for the price and the location. How often do you get the chance to stay right on the Piazza Farnese in the heart of Rome",,,
Suburbguy,2516115,"I checked in late on the first night of what was to be 2 nights for business. The place was dingy, but passable. Upon getting up in the morning, the sun was coming in through the window and I noticed a dried substance on the headboard with was white and still had some residue on it. I am guessing it was ejac. Quick shower, packed and down to the desk to explain issue and to get another room key and went to work. Got back from work, went to room number 2 and checked it out and when I checked under the mattress for bed bugs or other nasties, I found 2 used tampon applicators. I checked out of this hole.

Family of 2 and 2 children on our Christmas vacation.. Great deal on hotels.com. Loved the location since I had no intentions of walking anywhere. Del Taco, gas station, mom and pop stores right across the street. Just up the block, grocery store, CVS, etc. Very close to freeway access. About 15 min drive to Universal Studios and Hollywood walk of fame. Hotel could use a face lift and modern decor. Its a 2-story hotel with no elevators. But I preferred to be on the 2nd floor because of the balcony. I felt safer considering the bottom level room lanais were open to parking lot. Ample free parking. Room was quite spacious and odorless. Could use pillow top beds and new (flat screen) tv. Stains on drapes and slow drainage in tub. *There was a bottel cap opener attached to wall next to tub.. Hmmm?? Speaks for itself. LOL! The free breakfast buffet was better than most. DIY waffles, cereals, boiled eggs. Enough to start the morning! The indian man at front desk was very helpful, cant say the same for the others. The girls should at the least smile.. Life cant be that bad, right? I would like to suggest a printer for the ""business office"" (one pc in lobby). Hotel also provided 24 hr use of microwave in lobby, as well as hot coffee/tea. Will recommend to stay for the budget traveler! My family, 10 year old kid and husband, stayed in Vallye inn & conference center in Mission Hills for 3 weeks august 2011! We planned to stay for only 3 days and move around the LA area, but due to the cool pool and good location to explore the city we stayed for our whole vacation. The room is a little bit run down but clean and good size for 3 person. The room facing pool is quiet, on fridays and saturdays there is lots of people by the pool though, but they close the pool at 10 pm and after that it is very quiet. There is quite good continental breakfast but at weekends when the hotel was fully booked they run out of the most at breakfast, lacking eggs, toast, no fruit and so on. The kids loves the waffel machine you get warm fresch ones every morning. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel should remove the wall to wall carpets in the rooms and the lobby and change the run down sofas in the lobby and this would give the whole hotel a huge lift. The wall to wall carpets upstairs smell cat pee sometimes. This is not a luxury hotel but for this price this gives very good value for the money. the area around is not so nice, I wouldnÂ´t take a walk in the area even during the daytime, but you have some simple restaurants around to get take away food and 2 food markets close by to get some drinks to your fridge and enjoy the sunset on the balcony. The best thing with the hotel is the pool and the friedly staff. ItÂ´s nice to get back to hotel after dusty sightseeing and take a swim in the pool in the evenings. The Garden area around the pool is nice with all the flowers and birds. We were often sleeping with the door open and heard the mornings birds. There is free wireless in the rooms and free parking giving added value. For those not having an own laptop you have a computer outside the reception to borrow. Before I booked I read many reviews and I was a little afraid about this one. From the pictures it seemed really good but since we are from the East Coast had no clue on what to expect. It was super convenient! A food store less than a block away, Pizza Hut right next, neighborhood is very quiet. For this price you CANNOT get anything better in this area. Trust me!! We attended a seminary for 4 days in North Hills (bad area) and we loved this hotel. Free breakfast and Internet! Room is a little outdated, not a lot of channels on TV... but Free Internet! nowdays you dont get that. Room smelled good...and shower was good too (outdated but ok). Only thing is the bed is not a five star bed but again... you get what you paid for. Staff is super good!! I actually got a good rate and my friend and wife were coming later on that night and they gave them the same rate than us. Very pleased! Friendly staff, quiet rooms, plenty of space in the room, nice view of the pool area which is a great feature complete with palm trees, easy access to and from the freeways and eating establishments. It is also close to many attractions that individuals or families travel to see. The complimentary breakfast was excellent including the ability to make your own waffles. We have stayed at Mission Hills Inn (now renamed Valley Inn) several times and been very pleased with it. While it is an older property (and some things are a bit dated), the overall value is quite good. Rooms are most spacious (with a decent balcony including chairs) and if you ask for one facing the pool, the view out the room is also quite good. This also avoids the traffic noise from the street. There is a lovely, and very large pool that families will greatly enjoy. Being close to 6 Flags doesn't hurt and this would be a good base of operations. If you avoid the early AM rush, the drive down 405 to Santa Monica and UCLA/Brentwood) is a breeze. There is a new owner/management team and they are most helpful and gracious (Yvette in particular but she is not the only one). The breakfast includes waffles, cereal, muffins, etc. and is more than adequate. If you are a regular, you can most likely get a break on their prices.",,,
Brooke S,815110,"We were in LA filming a TV shoot for the week and a lot of us were first time LA-ers. Everyone from the front desk to the valet service to the concierge were exceptionally friendly and went above and beyond to display exemplary service to our entire cast and crew. Ray and Jose, our concierge were beyond kind in helping with even the smallest of requests. They made our 5 days in LA a pleasurable working experience. So glad we decided not to continue our stay at Hollywood Hotel after receiving TERRIBLE service from Devon their receptionist. They lost a couple grand that day thats for sure!!! The staff at the hotel was friendly and the bed sheets were pretty clean but everything else was awful. The towels were brown and dingy. The paint was peeling from the shower and the bottom of the shower looked like someone had walked around in it with dirty shoes. It also had a constant leak. The water pressure was nice but it literally took 10 minutes for the warm water to start. There were alot of guests that stayed there fulltime because as we were waiting for the shuttle to Disney there were kids getting on the school bus. Sketchy guys always standing out front trying to bum cigarettes. No internet besides the computer down stairs that charges 25 cents a minute. No breakfast. Positives were that it was quiet at night (which is probably because noone was staying there) and the shuttle to and from Disney was always on time. BUT there is only a couple of times to choose from. It leaves at 8am in the morning and you can return to your hotel at either 7:45 or 10:30pm. Oh and when we got there we had to switch rooms because the first rooms front door did not lock when we left. We decided to keep our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door because everything seemed shady. Did not want the maids coming in the room with our stuff. Wasps nests on the balcony too so we could not go out there. BEWARE of this hotel!!! We were in LA filming a TV shoot for the week and a lot of us were first time LA-ers.

If you are looking for the tourist section of NYC this hotel is not for you. If you are looking for the Ritz, this is definately not it. What you have is a gem located in Chinatown. I stayed here in September for 1 week with my sister and bestfriend and had the best time. My personal advice is that if you flew in to NYC (via LaGuardia) you can get a week train pass from the Hudson News Stand for like $29 dollars. It is located by baggage claim. GET THIS! YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH....even if your stay 3 or 4 days, at $2.25 each way it adds up fast. Anyway, the F train is a 5 min walk. My sister and I did not pack any bathroom toiletries and we found everything we needed across the street at the asian pharmacy. It had everything we needed. There is a Starbucks about a 15 min walk at Allen and Delancey. If your worried about the walk then you better get used to it, that seems to be all that you do in NYC. After going out at night in the East Village I took a cab back and with generous tip I spent $10. Back to the hotel, it is very clean, had an Iron and board, and a blow dryer, clean towels, ice and vending machines. If you come to NYC to stay in the room and order room sevice you better stay in Midtown and pay the price. If you are coming to NYC and want to dig in and enjoy what the city has to offer than this is the best place to stay. I dont think most people are realistic in their expectations when staying places, certaintantly in New York. Stay here and see for yourself, and if you think its bad....book a room at The Carter in Midtown for a night and then let us know what you think. I guarantee you will be looking at the ""glass half full"" after that. Thank you Hotel 91 for a great stay....See you in December for 5 days We stayed here for the last two days of our China trip and it was a great place to lay our heads! It had a great shuttle service which took us to the harbour as well as the shopping streets. They have a great tourist TV channel which helped us plan our days there. The service was exceptional.

My daughter and I traveled from Nashville to the Colts/Bengals game and stayed at this location the night before. The room was as nice as any Hilton we have stayed in.

Sens4life,529972,"I agree with the other reviewers, this is in no way a 4-star hotel, however the rooms have tall ceilings and strong air conditioning. The facility's biggest asset is its' location. Sitting between the Vatican and San Pietro metro station, both a approximately 5 minutes away by foot. There is no free Internet, just an over-priced computer in the lobby. Despite the disappointing tangibles, I'd still recommend it based on the surrounding neighbourhood. Staying so close to the Vatican state yet far enough from the noise is worth it in my opinion. Was surprised to see such a highly rated hotel for under 80 Euros a night, and it did not disappoint. Located very close to the Spittlemarkt metro station, the rooms were large and decorated nicely. There is a Mediterranean restaurant onsite, who also provides the room service. Since it is a restaurant, the quality is a bit better and the price a little cheaper than typical room service. The staff was very helpful, great English. My only complaint was the Internet, they offer a free basic service and a premium service. The free service (wired) felt like it was intentionally bogged down in an attempt to convince customers to upgrade for 17 Euros a night. Marriott, get with the freaking times. Even if my conspiracy suspicion is incorrect, the Internet service is a joke and if it's necessary to do electronic business on your trip, this is going to frustrate you. I've used Wifi in 20 Euro hostels that was 10 times faster than this. Other than that, I'd recommend it Situated in a nice part of Barcelona, very close to the Glories Tower and the beach is within walking distance, albeit a long walk. The hotel can be easily reached from the Glories or Monumental metro stops. Finding it the first time may be confusing as the streets in Barco aren't always clearly marked, but you'll get the hang of it. There is a handy little supermarket beside the hotel. The free wifi was fast. In my opinion, a perfect option for mid-range accommodation seekers visiting Barcelona. Room small but adequate, very friendly staff, two pools, two good restaurants and fast, free wireless Internet. The only thing I didn't like is the location. Situated outside of the downtown area, I didn't anticipate this being a problem since it was on the #48 bus route but the route is unreliable and found myself waiting too long for a bus that was supposed to run by every 15 minutes. On my date of departure I waited at least 35 minutes for the bus. Maybe I am nit-picking but I wasn't the only one who found this annoying. If you have your own transportation I'd recommend it, but for the rest of us I say get something closer to Centraal. Great location, located right next to Roma Termini however the close proximity of so many trains and trams will provide an alarm clock that you can hear and feel starting at 5 in the morning. Rooms small, old and barely adequate, however if arriving on a late train and looking for a simple, cheap place to rest for the night I'd recommend it. No Internet in lobby or in rooms, when you see how old this place is it won't surprise you. Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful. Centrally located in Mongkok, the rooms are very basic and bathrooms are communal. Air con settings can't be changed and does little to change the room temperature. Beds are typical Chinese stiff mattresses. To my surprise there was a TV but nothing worth watching. Wi-fi only works in the lobby. Three MTR stations are within walking distance, and if you need to get to/from the airport the hotel partners with Vigor Transportation to get you there for $110, not much more than the Airport Express. Even though it sucks it's the only place I can afford outside of Chunking Mansion, so I'll probably be back.","Hotel is old and a little on the down side. Room was large and convenient to the Roma Termini train station. But it was located at a corner where all the traffic must turn, and as a result there was a lot of road noise at all hours. Easy walk to the Metro. Neighborhood looks dicey at night but it's really not that bad. I walked around late at night on way back from dinner and there were a number of people on the streets, also returning home. Not bad, but you can probably do better for the same money. Elyse 2.5 stars would have been about right, had it been available. It is a 10-15 min walk from Termini, far enough with luggage, and first impressions are not good, very scruffy outside. However, once through the doors it is clean enough inside, though the photos are very flattering and taken quite some time ago. The staff have limited English, but then again you are in Italy, and I found them all very pleasant. The room was very basic, maybe the pitfalls of being a single which always draws the short straw with rooms, and overlooked the rail system which meant it was pretty noisy and no sign of air con but the bathroom was fine even if it was a juggle round the door to get to the toilet. The breakfast was basic rolls/small cakes/juice/tea/coffee but was fine for me though people with a more âAmericanâ diet would want more. There was a pleasant courtyard at the back but no sign of a bar. The big problem for me was the location as it was a fair walk to get to anything and there are a lot of hotels of all grades better located and I feel that it is a bit overpriced for what you get.

Plenty to eat and if you want, you can use the kitchen to cook your other meals. A few blocks from the Termini and when you leave, you can leave your cases at her father's hotel - a block from the Termini. Diana is friendly and helpful.

JimDavisHouston,98651,"Stayed on Business. This Hotel was booked because it was assigned to me by the Customer. $12.00 per day for parking in an open, unsecured, âPark at Your Own Riskâ lot is outrageous! I have to admit though, the room I had was very nice. I had been upgraded to a Deluxe room on the Lake side. The rooms on the Lake side have outdoor balconies, so if there are any Smokers reading this, the balcony would be convenient. The hallway smelled slightly musty, but the room was neutral. I didnât detect any type of smell in the room. (Good, bad, or otherwise.) The room was quite large. Bathroom was nice. The beds were clean, and the mattress was firm. Very large flat screen TV with around 75 channels. Good quality picture that was easy on the eyes. Heat was effective and quiet. Large work desk, with convenient power outlets. Outlets were also available at bed side. Breakfast was at 6:30am. It was a nice buffet equal to the others, with eggs, breakfast meat, hash browns, and the usual continental items. Breakfast is usually free at the other Hotels I use, but this one cost me $17.00 per day. So, in the end, the room was nice, but after taxes and add on fees, the price was not. Rooms are clean, beds are firm and comfortable, and somewhat quiet. There is a very nice on site restaruant. Not much on TV if you don't understand French. I had a few issues on my 3 day stay. I love my coffee in the morning, but when I looked at the coffee maker, it was full of stagnant water, and didn't work. I mentioned it to the front desk, but the water remained in the pot for my entire stay. Free internet, but very slow, and it disconnects every 15 minutes or so. I live in a warm climate, and am not used to the cold and snow. But if you have it, you should tryto control it ! It snowed every day. The walkway was clear in front of the front door, and that was it. Walkways and parking lot were covered with a layer of snow, and solid ice under. Walking to and from the car with a 25lb shoulder case every day was treachorous. The constant slipping caused a miserable neck and backache. It's a relitively nice stay if you don't have to go outside. The staff was friendly and helpful. This Hampton has a Happy Hour Ã¢â¬â Monday to Thursday in the front lobby. Free Food & Drinks. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s right on the Freeway, and thereÃ¢â¬â¢s road construction, but the room was amazingly quiet. The quietness was almost spooky. Rooms are typical Hampton. Microwave & Fridge, Thermostat controlled heat & AC that was quiet and effective. Clean carpets in the room and in the hallway. The bed was a bit softer than I like, but I got a great nights sleep every night. Flat Screen TV with 29 channels. Standard size work desk with 2 outlets on the desk lamp, and a power strip on the floor. The Free Wi-Fi was fast and reliable. No actual business center, but there were 2 computers and printer in the lobby. The fitness center has almost anything you need. The Hampton breakfasts are always great. I have yet to find a Hampton Breakfast that was sub par. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s always more than expected. Food and convenience stores are close by.","Inexpensive, Clean, and Friendly! The only complaint in our party was the beds promised were queen, but they looked a little smaller like a full size. The beds were comfortable, the price is affordable. There is construction going on all over Dallas so it is hard to navigate around, but not impossible. The rooms did not smell like smoke. The carpet was clean. The breakfast served longer hours so that was relieving. B+ Very nice stay, would definitely come back to this Hampton Inn. The staff was friendly and helpful.

However, the a/c was definetly a problem. I turned the thermostat down to 65 and was still sweating during the night. My husband even complained about the temperature (which is unusual for him). After missing our flight, we had to stay at this hotel. The shuttle picked us up and the staff was very efficient at having everything ready for our stay. The rooms were very nice, quiet, and close to the vending machines and ice machine. Free wi-fi made it very convenient. The complimentary breakfast was very complete; cereal, oatmeal, muffins, fruits, and even belgian waffles made my day. If I ever have to go to Dallas, I won't hesitate on booking this hotel. I stayed in room 431 (the top floor) for one night on business travel. The room was very neat and clean. I had a king size bed, two end tables, a writing desk with swivel chair, a coffee table with couch. The only thing that was not it tip top shape was the couch which had about a 4"" slash on the back cushion. The TV was an older model and the picture was sharp. The gym had two treadmills, a recumbent bike, a stairstepper, and a weight machine - all in good working condition. It was cold out so I didn't take time to see the pool area. They had a breakfast buffet that was well laid out. There were biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted sweet rollls and donuts, cereals, make your own waffle, and juices. Also, prepared fruit and a basket of mixed fruite. Everything tasted fresh and the hot foods were hot and the cold foods were cold. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. Driving access was from a back street as the street the hotel fronts on is under construction. The parking lot and hotel are directly adjacent to a LaQuinta. Coming and going out the back was not a problem and there were various stores and gas stations that were extremely convenient. The WIFI was open and my iphone worked well. The staff was helpful. I liked the hotel because it appeared to be well run and maintained. Everything worked as it should and I did not have to contend with any situations that might have distracted me from my business. I booked through Orbitz and the price I received seemed a good value for the quality of my stay. My husband and I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn for a seminar that we attended (not on site). The hotel was very clean and the staff friendly. Our room was spacious (and clean). The king size bed was comfortable. There was a coffe pot, refrigerator and microwave in the room, along with free wi-fi. I was able to connect to the wi-fi with my smart phone. In the morning, the hotel served a small ""hot"" breakfast (such as waffels, scrambled eggs, sausage, sausage gravey with biscuits, etc.), along with the usual continental breakfast items (pastries, toast, yogert, cereal, fruit). The location is right off of I-35, so ""busy"" outside but the traffic didn't carry inside. There are several restaurants within walking distance, and many more within driving range. The hotel suited our needs quite well. We would stay again in the future. In areas with overwhelming heat, it was a welcomed surprise to find the room very comfortable. Very clean, evening snacks, friendly staff, very quiet room (couldn't hear freeway or raging storm that came through). Hampton Inns are our go to hotel and this was better than average. There was major road construction going on in front, but since the entrance is from the rear of the property, this was not problem. Hampton has the best bedding! I have stayed at this Hampton for many years, the staff and mgr are great, however I've never liked or felt safe at the location. I started stayiing there because my colleagues stayed there, I have to admit the happy hour and snacks are enough to be dinner, but location is horrible. I had just filled up my suburban with gas at the station across the street and when i got in the truck the next morning i realized it had been siphoned. When I got in and started the car the check engine light came on and said ""fuel cap loose"" .. they must have been in a hurry. Also there are always working girls on the corner and in the parking lot..(quite obivous)! This was the cleanest Hampton Inn I've stayed in. Cleaning staff is superb. There for the Superbowl, so it was centrally located. I had a great stay and happy hour is wonderful. They had a tex mex theme with wine, soda and beer to wash it down every night. Great little gym and plenty of parking. Manager is personable, which gave it that intimate feeling. Great stay!! The hotel itself was very nice but the first impression of the area was sealed when the cab pulled past the abandoned hotel that shares the parking lot. There were several homeless people ""camped"" out there. I did not have a rental car and the choice of restaurants in walking distance is extremely limited but the food wasn't bad. The area is also home to several Gentleman's clubs and the type of clientele that brings. I did like the happy hour and the breakfasts, they were definitely a nice touch, no complaints about the room either. Despite the area, it was a quiet hotel. I did not use the pool since it seemed too ""exposed"" outside beside the highway and with the bums around.",,,
Valrit,3256888,"This property only opened two weeks ago (August 2012) and is one of the largest hotels of this chain. The main entrance is not yet finished, so you enter via Bonham Street West (backside of hotel). There is a Starbucks coffee shop on the ground floor, otherwise the hotel breakfast is around 120 HKD. The rooms are small, fresh and modern with all amenities. Free wifi is available. This hotel will probably attract a lot of tour groups, it's also a large hotel with 550 rooms - so don't expect personal service. There are many promotional prices below 100 USD at the moment, but the rates go up quickly. Sheung Wan is an interesting area to explore, with lots of restaurants, cafes, galleries, shops close to the hotel. Nearest subway station: Sheung Wan This hotel is part of the International Youth Hostel Association, located close to Changi Airport, about 5 min. walk from Pasir Ris MRT. It was an unexpected pleasant surprise, since you would normally only expect very basis services from a Youth Hostel. This place, however, offers modern rooms with bathroom, wifi, free breakfast, arge swimming pool all inclusive for a very low price. If you want to combine business and holiday, this may be an option to do so. Check in is open 24 hours.","Stayed with my husband and 2 young kids. Check in took forever, even though it was not a busy time. We were assigned adjoining rooms. But on seeing that one of the rooms had a connecting door, we asked if we could change one of the rooms to the connected room. Staff was extremely rude and condescending. Rooms were very small, but clean. But no toiletries except for a hanging shampoo / showergel. Kind of what you get in a budget hotel, disappointing. Rooms not made the next day by 3pm until we called the room service to request for it. Breakfast was very simple, and did not have an omelet station even for that price. Hotel also quite a walk from the MTR, through backlanes. Not a pleasant walk. There is a moneychanger and a 7-11 nearby, but not much else. No pool for kids also. Not impressed with hotel in general, but i guess that could be the after taste from the bad check-in experience. Except that you need walk about 10 minutes from subway, the hotel is perfect for the short economic stay. ç¬¬ä¸æ¬¡ç»è¿ä¸ªIBISè¯ä»·ã å ä¸ºæè¿æ¯æ¯å¹´ä¼å»é¦æ¸¯ï¼ææ¶åå¬å·®ææ¶åä¸ªäººï¼é£ä¹ä¸ä¸ªç©å»ä»·ç¾çæ¿é´æ¯å¾å³é®ãèé¦æ¸¯æ¿ä»·é¢é«ãè¿ä¸ªéåºè¿æ¯å¾å¼å¾æ¨èã é¤äºæç¹è¿ï¼ç¦»ä¸ç¯è¦èµ°ä¸10åéå¤ï¼éåºå¾ä¸éï¼æ¿é´å¹²åï¼ä¹ç®å®éï¼å°¤å¶æ¯æ¿é´é¢ç§¯ä¸å°ãä¸æ¯ä¸è¬çéåºåªè½è½¬ä¸ªèº«çç©ºé´ãæå¡ä¸éï¼å°¤å¶æ¯æè®¢æ¿çåå­åæ¤ç§æäºåºå¥ï¼ä½åå°å¾èå¿çç»è§£å³äºé®é¢ã å½ç¶ï¼ä»·æ ¼å¨ç»æµçï¼ä¸è½å¥¢æè±ªåã The MTR is far from the hotel, 15 minutes walking. I was surprised that they didn't have refridgerator to freeze my ice pack (i need to keep my medicine cool). We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights but we couldn't sleep well for 3 nights because of the extremely terrible noise from the other room (the Chinese men, they open the doors and talk very loudly every early morning). I had complaint to the hotel staff but still the same, the noise, from other room, in the same floor. I thought that I was at the market instead. The room is good, clean, but when I arrive, we didn't have facial cloths. Anyway, I have stayed at about 10 accor hotels around the world, but this hotel is the worst. I will not choose it again. Took the Airport Express to Hong Kong station and then a taxi to the Ibis. All in cost me HKD115. The hotel is located in Sheung Wan and is about a 10 minute walk to the Sheung Wan MRT station. I had booked online and got what I thought was a reasonable rate which included a harbour view, breakfast and internet. The Hotel location is particularly good if the intention is to catch a ferry to Macau being s close to the Macau ferry terminal. I arrived quite late in the evening but check in, which was on the 5th floor, was reasonably efficient. The Starbucks on the ground floor had not opened and you have to take the side street next to Starbucks to get into the Hotel. Having said that, there was a staff on the Ground floor who directs you to the lifts. Room was typical Ibis, clean and efficient although I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary slippers and fridge. Bathroom is small but shower pressure is good and layout is functional although no bath tub. Noted earlier complaints about cleanliness but I had no such issue. Generally a typical Ibis although they do surprise every so often. Most of the guests at the Hotel were tour groups from mainland China and I can see this being a popular Hotel for them. All in all a great, reasonably priced Hotel if you want to be on the Island. Initially, I book via hotels.com and the booking came back as unsuccessful (reason: hotel is full). I then went to accor-hotels.com to book and managed to book 2 rooms. After my stay, when I returend hone, I found out that the hotel has charged both bookings on my credit card. i emailed the hotel for answers and they told me there were 2 confirmed bookings, 1 each from accor-hotels.com and hotels.com. I emailed them the hotels.com failed booking email and they ahve yet to respond to me. Terrible experience. They did not even tell me that there were 2 bookings when I emailed before arrival to confiorm my booking and also when I was checking-in to the hotel. Looks like the counter staff is very in-experienced as it took about 20 mins to check-in. We decided to stay at this new hotel for 4 nights to get experience staying on Hongkong Island. Also this hotel has the cheapest rate & availability compare to other Accor Group hotels in Hongkong at the time. But I was disappointed that the reception had to asked me twice to confirm that my bed preference is one king size bed! I never been asked about my bed preference/request when I stayed with any other Accor Group Hotels even when I was travelling by myself. If I was going to put my partner on different bed or another room then I would put that request through when I was making the booking. But overall this hotel is good and also very clean as this hotel is still new and bathroom size is good for Ibis standard. Breakfast is good for Ibis standard but little bit too expensive for what you get. I hardly can't sleep because my bed was very hard (maybe because it is still new?) and if you don't like staying in the hotel that you must transfer to another lift to get to your room from ground floor then this hotel may not be your right choice. Location wise is ok considering shops & restaurants are everywhere in Hongkong and handy to public transport. Also if you willing to pay more then choose harbour view.

jeannie459,203177,"I stayed in this hotel prior to going on a Med cruise, and was apprehensive as the location was quite a distance from the city centre. However the train station is just around the corner and getting into Central Rome was easy. The area surrounding the hotel is upper class residential and very safe for walking, even in the evening. The staff were very helpful with local information and I was given a large suite on the top floor. The breakfast was continental and the coffee was good. I would recommend this hotel. I stayed at the UNA Hotel Venezia with my daughter as a birthday treat. We had no problem finding the hotel thanks to the information given by a previous visitor. I would recommend copying the directions and taking them with you, as the hotel has no sign on the exterior. The area is ideal, just a couple of streets away from a good shopping, eating area with a lively bar area in the evening. The water bus stop is a couple of minutes walk away and makes a cheap way to get around Venice when you get tired out with all the walking ( take very comfortable shoes) The hotel is situated on a very quiet canal and the interior is very clean. The rooms are stylish and immaculate. We found the staff at reception very helpful. The breakfast was very good with lots of choice including a hot choice. I would definelty stay here again.","Cesar Ritz would be turning over in his grave if he stayed at ths ""Ritz"". It is also no Grand Hotel in the French tradition. Be suspicious of any Italian hotel or merchandiser which plagiarizes a name - witness ""Speado"" which is ""Speedo"" in Italian. Judging by the inferior quality of this hotel, it is certainly not what the name implies. Caveat emptor. The rooms are tiny, the service is lousy, and the prices are astronomical. Why stay at a hotel far from the centro storico. There is a good bar/cafe on Piazza Euclide but that is about it. Save your money and find a pensione closer to the Piazza Venezia. Avoid booking this hotel at all costs. Fiasco trying to book the hotel online (they don't own their own website??). My room had clearly once been broken into: the door hinge area was all chewed up. Breakfast was a disaster, the coffee is the worst I have ever tasted, not what I expect from an Italian hotel. The bar staff was slow and rude The other reviews about the key cards not working are absolutely right, the system fails every so often and I could have easily got a key card for another room because they didn't bother to check my ID or name... Summary: shockingly bad. Steer clear. I stayed in this hotel prior to going on a Med cruise, and was apprehensive as the location was quite a distance from the city centre. However the train station is just around the corner and getting into Central Rome was easy. The area surrounding the hotel is upper class residential and very safe for walking, even in the evening. The staff were very helpful with local information and I was given a large suite on the top floor. The breakfast was continental and the coffee was good. I would recommend this hotel. The hotel is very ""old"". Its like it comes from the sixties or seventees, without any renovation. The rooms are full of wall papers and old ""tired"" textiles. The curtain in the bathroom was rivened. The breakfast was poor and the quality bad. Just 3-4 choices... For this hotel we spend 245 euro for a triple room..... WE found hotel good value, room comfortable, breakfast adequate, good selection and enough to go around! Distance to and from city not problem, bus service 910 goes from outside hotel to Termini TIP;- BE SURE to get tickets from Euclide station around the corner from hotel for bus/metro/train, and REMEMBER to activate tickets within 75 minutes of boarding - inspectors target the tourists, and we were fined 50 Euros - we had bought the tickets but hadnt activated them! Taxi from hotel to Terravision at Termini cost us 15 Euro including 2Euros for luggage! Noise was a slight problem, but nothing major, reception staff a bit surly but helpful. Would NOT recommend organised trips - evening panoramic tour costing 41 Euros was a rip-off, and the Vatican/Sistine Chapel tour costs 56 Euros - people book this one as we are told it's a 4-hour wait to get in if you're not with a tour, but we tried ourselves - got the metro and train to near Vatican (2 stops), where we were met by lots of tour guides offering us the trip for 40 Euros! We did it ourselves, there were no queues, and it cost us 15 Euros, which covered the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel. We had to pay another 7 Euros to do La Cupola, which I would highly recommend if you can climb, as the views are spectacular. I MUST add that is was in May - there may be some queues later in the season. I was surprised by the comfort of this hotel. Due to an error, they had given my co-leader and myself a room with a matrimonial bed. When we protested, the not very helpful desk guy said that one of us could sleep on the pullout couch. Our Rome tour guide and my co-leader hammered him in Italian and since they had no more rooms with two beds, we each had our own suite. Although, the brocaded walls, curtains and bedspreads gave it the air of a brothel, I was extremely comfortable. The bath was lovely with a jet tub. I didn't mind being out of the center of Rome, because the rooms were bigger and the neighborhood quiet. If you are looking for nightlife, this is not the spot, but if you want rest after long days of sightseeing, it is just fine. One train stop takes you into the city where you can walk right down the Via del Corso to everything. The breakfasts do leave a bit to be desired, but are adequate. Again, you need to request real coffee, unless you are satisfied with the Nescafe from the machines (and many are). The waitstaff is very grateful for a euro or two when they bring the coffee and will have it for you the next morning. If your dinner is part of your tour group stay, finish the pasta, because the main courses are not the best. We only had fresh vegetables after our Rome guide demanded a salad for the next day, otherwise canned peas were the norm. Overall, I would stay there again as part of tour, probably not when traveling on my own, because they do cater to tours.",,,
Kristina H,663273,"We looked for a hotel in western Rome and found Casa La Salle through other positive reviews on Trip Advisor.

Our room was basic, very clean and beds comfortable. Lift to second floor, easy access for wheelchairs to and inside the hotel but a small hill upwards from the park gate. Ample breakfast was served in the restaurant, a large room, somewhat noisy. There was Internet access in day room for e-mail but ban on Facebook and chat sites.

Perfect!","My friend and I stayed at Casa La Salle in Rome last Dec 26, 2011 for 5 days. It was very clean and quite. It was close to bus stop and subway. We were a little bit confuse on which button to push to open the gate after a long day going around the city. Before checking in, you need to ask the receptionist which button to push to open the gate so you can come in. There is no curfew. And you can ask the receptionist a night before for a transportation to the airport. It's not free. Overall the place is very clean. I would stay again if I visit Rome.

Wonderful staff, clean rooms, well maintained, comfortable beds, excellent buffet breakfast, a couple of subway stops from the Vatican (long walk), wonderful peaceful grounds. We had 3 rooms for 3 families with kids ranging in age from 9 to 18 and we were all happy. It isn't a 5 star 'luxurious' hotel but simply an excellent safe clean place to stay at an economic rate. This is a great place to recharge yourself at any level while you visit the Eternal City! Because this hotel is run by the Christian Brothers, Casa La Salle is not the place to stay if you're looking for amazing luxury or incredible amenities. However, if all you want is a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a great location, Casa La Salle is a great choice for your trip. The nearest subway stop is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel, the nearest grocery store is less than 2, and great food just around the corner. Be advised that there are no queen sized beds, or even double beds. Double rooms mean two single beds, so if you're looking to share a bed with someone, you'll be pretty cramped for space. That said, the beds are comfortable, and the staff keeps the (small) bathrooms clean. The complimentary breakfast is absolutely delicious-- fresh croissants and hot Italian espresso are just one part of it. I was there for a week and never got sick of eating the same thing every morning. If you'd like a little more variety in your breakfast food, I would recommend the Pasticceria (spelling?) just down the street on the corner-- I could have spent all of my money there. I highly recommend the hot cocoa! One thing that some members of our group liked was the mass offered in the attached chapel. Even if you aren't interested in the services, it's worth a look at the chapel for its beauty. All in all, Casa La Salle was perfect for the purpose of our trip-- simple, clean, and in a great location. rooms are clean and tidy, with all amenities - the only drawback was the distance to the centre of rome - bus or metro ride needed really unless you like walking - which limited night time activities/restaurants",,,
Rob M,124015,"Great place to stay. On a one way street with a great pastry shop right across from the hotel. Very helpful staff that spoke English very well. Lots of restaurants and bars with in very short walking distance. Metro station VERY close by. 15-20 minute walk to the Seine, Notre Dame, etc.... We were in town for the holidays and booked this place online.....it looked ok from the pictures, but when we got there it was terrible.....there were people standing around everywhere.......nothing worked....it was filthy.....I witnessed a drug deal in front of our room and had a prostitute proposition me on the way to my car.......we only stayed one night and that was enough.....ended up sleeping on inflatable mattress at my inlaws house and it was actually better than that dump.....never go there and the city of indianapolis should be ashamed of its self and tear this place down.... Great location, but small rooms, stained carpets and upholstery, aging mattress, aged towels. Pillows and sheets were very nice quality as were soaps etc. TV old non flat screen. Pleasant staff. Location, location, location! Stayed here for one night before an early morning flight. Room was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Little Italy is right behind the hotel, and with a bunch of good restaurants. Also, the marina is a block in front of the hotel. But the best thing about this hotel was the free shuttle service to the airport. We had a 6am flight, and sure enough, the shuttle was right there to pick us up at 430am for the ride to the airport!

Wonderful decor, very clean, superb service from all the staff, great choice of breakfast and relaxing background music. We had a U232 room which had the biggest bed.

I was in town for a birthday celebration and the room was booked by my cousin. The room was dirty, One of the beds was broke. We couldn't get the clean towels we needed. And the bath tubdrain was clogged. There were stains on the sheets. Microwave only worked when you selected soup. Hall way lights were out. NEVER! I do mean never stay at this hotel. It shouldn't even be open for bussines. I should've made other accomodations . I really wish I listened to the reviews. This place was the dirtiest place I have ever seen in my life. There was a piece of wood holding up the corner of the sink. Carpets where stained. The bathroom was the worst part. There was mold in the bathroom, the tub it self was brown with stains. You could see mold growing in the bathroom along with the ceiling that looked like it was caving it. We actually went to a local store to buy flip flops to shower with. Which we finally could not bring ourselves to shower at the hotel so went to the in laws. When I complained they actually moved us to a room that was worse then the first. They showed me a total of 7 rooms each worse then the one before it. Tried to watch TV but it was mostly static. The only thing that was decedent in the hotel was the beds. The sheets were clean and the bed was comfy. Common area's were trashed with kids in the pool at 2AM. I heard a bunch of dogs barking all night. I do have pictures I will share with anyone who would like them. Feel free to contact me. I booked through expedia my entire trip. This seemed to be the worst part. When we checked in they did not ask for ID or anything, just told them our name and they gave us a paper to sign in. There was local police sitting in the parking lot going through the hotel register of guests, kind of creepy! Guessing there is someone they were looking for? The room had a funky smell. It was HOT in there, the A/C did not work. There was a coffee pot, but no coffee making things. No cups for water. There was one of the ladies that works at the desk walking around eating all 3 times I seen her! I do want to note that the public area where the pool and sitting area was very pretty. I am sure pets are allowed because there were many barking dogs and cats in many of the windows I booked through Hotels for Everyone. I did read some of the reviews, but like others, did not pay much attention. The rate was so cheap, and I am not really picky, so I took a chance. After all, It IS a Ramada Inn! Luckily, after checking in, my husband suggested that we look at the room before taking in our bags. We immediately got back in the car and found a room about a block away at the Holiday Inn Express. It was twice the money, but absolutely worth it. This place should be shut down or burned to the ground. Do not ignore the reviews. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! Well I didn't quite have the experience that some of the other guests have experienced. We stayed there due to the ""24 hour airport shuttle with nonstop service"" that was advertised on their website and the great deal they were offering. Well, it isn't nonstop service, you have to schedule it. And the front desk staff did not notify the driver so when we went to the front desk (thankfully a little early) in the morning they had to call her. It was no problem and very early and the driver was very pleasant despite the early hour. Front desk staff was always very friendly. They gave us the wrong keys the first time and it was easily changed. The shared accomodation areas (conference center, pool, etc.) looked pretty nice and in decent shape. Our room was an outside room, which is not ideal and probably would have stopped us from booking but whatever. The room was...not good. There was stained furniture and the bathroom wasn't too clean. I took a shower with my sandals on and had my husband do a sponge bath, figuring he would be dirtier for getting in the actual shower. The sheets looked clean and the bed was fine. We didn't watch too much television, so can't comment on that. The hotel has it's ups and for us the airport transfer was one of those. Their shuttle actually goes all over the city and is conveniently located, so nice for out-of-town travelers who don't want to rent a car. Have to say I've heard and read horror stories, but, honestly We had a very enjoyable stay. staff very friendly and willing to go the extra mile for me and my family, The pool was refreshing and the staff was there to make sure things were ok, towels, drinks, etc. I do admit the hotel is not new but the extras offered and location made our stay worth it . I also understand after reading a lot of these reviews most people thought they were in a 5 star hotel and paying 300.00 a night for it .. and that a lot of travelers feel the need to complain about life rather than make the best of it .. The hotel building itself is actually quite nice, even though it is in what seems to be a shady area. There is a nice atrium area that has a place to sit and hang out with a pool. The hotel was also very quiet, almost to the point of wondering if anyone else was staying there. The rooms were dated and a little run down, but if it had ended there i would have been fine considering the deal we got on the room. The whole hotel honestly looked like there hadn't been a cleaning crew there in about six months. There were pizza boxes and garbage stacked up next to the garbage cans. There were plates from the buffet breakfast still on the table at 6pm. The pool had dirty towels laying around it and the guest bathroom near the pool was flooded and had wet clothes in it; the light didnt work, so we had to find this out the hard way. After swimming for awhile we went back to our room to get ready for the day and when we came back, the pool had been shut down by the health department. Overall, bad experience.",,,
cariboukb,76460,"This is a great property, new, so everything is up to Hilton Standards. Rooms are suites, and are very comfortable and nicely appointed.

This is the second visit I have made to this hotel, arrangements made by the company that I work for. The hotel is clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. The breakfast has a nice variety...but the dinner should be a pass...the quality of the food is marginal. If you get a room on the front of the hotel...change it...quickly. With the I-5 directly out the windows, the noise in the bedroom area is a little loud. We should have been concerned when we had to be buzzed into the property at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night, and even more concerned when there was a security guard on foot patroling the parking lots. But hey, it's Southern California. Overall, the property is in good repair, but, it is showing signs of age. The breakfast is usual fare, and the evening receptions are very disappointing - I was traveling with a colleague that is a Vegan, and there was nothing that she could eat except for a poorly put together ice burg salad. Internet connectivity is poor at best. The highlight of the week here was the staff that drove our daily shuttle (our business meetings were in VanNuys).

They were courteous and always on time when we requested a pick up. A personable and friendly staff greets you at the front desk and fulfills requests for information and service with a smile. Suites are spacious and well equipped - especially the kitchen. I hear that extensive room renovations are planned for April and May, one building at a time, so not to interfere with guest's experience. A good hot breakfast served in the main house. Clean pool and lounges, along with a large outdoor patio. Convenience store, Starbucks and a Deli in walking distance. Gocery store and several restaurants near by (by car). Easy access to the 118-Freeway. BUR airport about 30 minutes drive. The employees we encountered were all nice and helpful. The room itself was clean and spacious. Water pressure was great. The light housecleaning met our needs. The pool and hot tub were clean and great after a long day on the town. The free breakfast buffet was extension and tasty. Parking was a bit of a pain, as the spots were really close and a lot of people double parked, but besides that, the location worked for us and we had a great stay. Probably one of the oldest properties in the Staybridge system; buffet breakfast was unappealing; service was below average; and the shower water was cold in our room. We ended up moving to another IHG affiliated property the next night. If you like Trader JoeÃ¢â¬â¢s or Whole Foods, then Staybridge Suites is the hotel that you should stay at in Chatsworth. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s only 5 minutes away from these markets! ItÃ¢â¬â¢s also conveniently located just a few blocks from Hwy 118 and Reseda Blvd where youÃ¢â¬â¢ll find all the shopping malls and restaurants. We always stay at this hotel whenever weÃ¢â¬â¢re in north LA for business. The 2-bedroom 2-bath suite is large and very comfortable, with nicely decorated livingroom and a fully equipped kitchen (flat top stoves, microwave, dishwasher, sink, cooking wares, dishes). We love the kitchen because we enjoy making meals with all the good foods from Trader JoeÃ¢â¬â¢s! The beds are big with plenty of pillows and clean sheets. The thick curtains keep the bedrooms in pitch-black darkness, great for sleeping! In fact, itÃ¢â¬â¢s so dark that we have to plug in a small night light (we always travel with one) so we donÃ¢â¬â¢t walk into walls trying to find the bathroom in the middle of the night! We also like the free high speed internet (youÃ¢â¬â¢ll need a passcode from the very helpful front desk staff to connect) and free parking. Not sure why but the parking spaces in front of our suite are all tiny (as in everywhere else in CA we noticed!), our compact rental car can barely fit in! As a person who has stayed at this hotel multiple times, I've had a chance to see its response to changing times. While it remains a pretty good deal(prices have risen in the last few trips), there is evidence of staff/service cutbacks under the new management co. Most noticeable is the service during the breakfast period. Where this was once staffed by multiple people keeping the coffee and food containers filled, now there is one, lone woman who really can't do it all. I expressed this to the staff at checkout. The food remains OK, but there needs to be more than one person on duty from 6:30-9:00. Room cleaning has also become more sparse, but that isn't a problem, per se. You can ask for more. All in all, I suggest more competitive rates and better food service. Still a good place. My love found this place thru hotwire and the price was great. We chose a 3rd floor room well off the street which was very quiet. The Plusses: Friendly and helpful staff. Best location for Chatsworth. Ample rooms. The suites were fully equipped. Large bathroom sink/ walk in closet area. The Minuses: Bathroom sink was stopped up---this should NEVER happen. Sitting room TV remote was not programed. Tiny toilet crammed next to tub/shower. The heater did not work. If you don't care about daily service, this is a good choice. Ria was extremely poilte, efficient and knew the area well - she could not have done more. Rooms were spotless with everything needed. Will most definitely stay here again. Other people commenting must have stayed somewhere else! I've stayed here twice, both bid through Priceline, both times, I got a good deal, in relative terms. The service is okay, not phenomenal like at other hotels, who'd bend-over backwards to get you what you need. The first time, I got a room on the first floor, the second time, on the 2nd floor. The location of the hotel is terrible, in general. It's in the middle of nowhere, no places to walk to and looks like it's kind of in a bad place. You have to drive to get anywhere, but it's LA. The first time I stayed, my car got broken into. They did the least amount of effort to help me. They gave me the number for the police and lent me their shop-vac. They didn't give me any plastic wrap (that I'm sure the kitchen has tons of), and they didn't even bother refunding me the price of the room! The second time I stayed, it was okay, couldn't sleep because the last time I stayed. The rooms has a full kitchenette. The parking sucks, there aren't enough spaces for all rooms. They also make you sign a clause that says if you party, they can take all your money and kick you to the curb. Although noted as a three star hotel, it is really an extended stay property. It's the first time I have been in an extended stay type of property. It is apartment like, you get a kitchen, living room, small bath and two desks, you get free fully cooked breakfast buffet in the morning and a simple dinner, wine, drinks Tuesday through Thursday. This helps cut costs for families traveling with children and after traveling for six weeks, mine were happy to see something that looked like an apartment. Free internet in the business center, free coffee/tea all day, free laundry and no parking fees really cut down the cost of traveling, particularly with children. BEWARE, although pet friendly, be warned, they charge $75 for three nights and $150 for six nights (almost three times the cost of the hotel rental if you got a deal on Priceline). Nowhere at the front desk does it say that there is a fee, particularly one that increases after three days to $150. When I was automatically charged this on check-out, I was assumed to know this. Day clerks are really nice, night staff is a bit grumpy, particularly Roy. This is east Chatsworth, not a gorgeous area, but near the mountains with a nice nightly breeze. It's worth it if you can get a deal bidding on a room through one of the sites, expensive if you pay their going rate of $160-170 a night. A nice alternative to a hotel though and with a separate living room/kitchen (with pullout couch) and double doors to the bedroom, it's a good place to share with someone. My kids loved it. Maintenance people are spyish. Oh, if using Netspend or debit cards, beware. Every couple of days a $50 charge is put through for your incidentals. With Netspend, It takes 20 days to get your incidental charges reversed you don't request that they fax a release to your debit card company, bank debit cards have their own policies. Bottom line, if you can get this room through priceline (the only 3 star hotel in their area other than the Radisson which is also an extended stay type) for $75-80, it's a pretty good deal. You have to go in to Woodland Hills for anything to do, about five miles away, tons of malls, theaters, restaurants. When I checked in, the front desk girl gave me the wrong room number. After multiple trips to the front desk to obtain new keys and having the maintence worker check the door, we found out the hotel room was already occupied! The poor lady was scared to death. The front desk girl wrote down the wrong room number. This hotel is dirty, located in a terrible location next to run down apartments and strip malls. The free breakfast was worse than Dennys. Don't stay here, I will never stay here again.",,,

We 3 are very satisfied what we got for the money we payed and will for sure come back I stayed here last month and the poor reviews on here are correct. The hotel is dark, smelly and dirty. It is occupied by injured Lybian people who have no respect at all for anyone else. The staff are just as bad-they ignore the guests, hardly smile and allow the Lybian occupants to run riot. The breakfast is barely edible-i managed some bread which was stale. We had countless issues with our room key breaking so we were locked out. The walls a paper thin and a nearby club will keep you awake most of the night due to noise. AVOID! i stayed there for 4 days in the begginig of march the hotel is very clean very near to taxim square only 5 minute on foot realy full breakfast you can find many many things to eat quit big rooms quite hotel the only problem is one lift for each wing This hotel sucks! The pictures are not related to reality! I stayed in a triple room and the one bed was a cot that looked like a grave. Although there were 3 beds there were 2 towels and no toilet paper(we had to ask for it). Chewing gums were stuck on the floor and there was no soap as in other 4 star hotels. Breakfast was disgusting. If you're european you won't be able to touch it. The only acceptable dish was some kind of pie with chocolate, but because it's the only tasty you can find there, it finishes immediately, so if you're thinking of having your breakfast at 8 thirty or so you won't find it. There were also some creepy/ perverts from Libya who touched the girls and tried to abuse us. Don't go there. The only positive thing is that it's close to Taksim square and the prices are logical. OH! Staff didn't even speak english. And the mini bar is totally empty. Not even some water. Stayed here the first week from january 2012,. 2 minutes from Taksimsquare, and the best shoppingstreet of Istanbul. Very lively area to spend the evening. Breakfast was great, a buffet meters long with something for every one. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We recommend it. I spent one night here and it was fine, nothing exciting. The staff were not overly impressive except for the bellboy who should be working at the worlds best hotel, he was completely on it. The reception desk service was terrible to begin with but improved considerably towards the end of my stay. If you are a non smoker, make sure you get a non smoking room or you will feel like you are personally being fumigated. Breakfast was mediocre by Turkish Standards. On the plus side, the hotel is centrally located in a safe area with perfect access to public transport and nightspots. I would put this at an upper 3 star status Location of the Hotel is very good. Taxism square is a very Happening place. You can find people enjoying even at midnight. Hotel Premises are neat and clean. Staff is very helpful and professional. Almost everything is available near the hotel. Overall I was satisfied staying in the hotel. This hotel was SUPPOSED to be a four star hotel, yet it was a piece of rubbish with a bunch of lies. The pictures on the website were nothing like the hotel itself. The staff does not smile and the receptionist looked like a piece of dry fish, and would not talk to us unless he wanted to scam us. The smell of the lobby and hallways was enough to turn your stomach upside down. It smells like sewage mixed with airplane food. Ohhh! and the view.. . DON""T EVEN GET ME STARTED! I had a beautiful view of the Bosphorus... NOT! More like the view of dirty men looking into our room while smoking. The ""BEAUTIFUL"" view also had loud fans. They were so loud that you couldn't hear anything when the windows were open. The walls were so thin, you could here the conversations of the people next door. The walls were all ripped and the lighting in the hallways and rooms were horrible. The lighting in the hallways was so bad that you could barely see anything. The washrooms were disgusting. There was black scum in the bathtub which would fill up so quickly during a five minute shower because it would not drain. The hotel barely provided toilet paper and towels. The only way you could get a couple was if you continued asking the staff. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYBODY, THIS TWO STAR HOTEL IS NOTHING LIKE THE FOUR STAR IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE! this hotel has very good location 5 min walk to taksim and istiklal street .very close to metro taksim station.indoor and out door swimming pool.everey day room cleaning and make up beds .air condition work properly.breakfast good .",,,
spangey78,306172,"we stayed here for 2 weeks as a family, the staff were REALLY friendly, especially the concierge and the restaurant staff, great facilities for kids, theres a kids zone, arcade, football area etc, and lovely pool we stayed here for 6 weeks as a family, the food in the restaurant Claymore10 (in the hotel) was always on top form, everything from oysters to currys to lobsters, the deserts were amazing and the staff cant do enough for you, the club lounge is also a wonderful bonus after a long day sightseeing. the pool is basic but the steam room and spa make up for the lack of inspiration of the pool design. The hotel is located in the heart of Orchard, perfect for shopping, restaurants night life, botanical gardens etc","we stayed here for 2 weeks as a family, the staff were REALLY friendly, especially the concierge and the restaurant staff, great facilities for kids, theres a kids zone, arcade, football area etc, and lovely pool I have to say after doing a few international relocation I've seen my share of extended stay apartments. Given that this was 4X what these suites generally cost I expected a spacious room and comfortable bed. When we walked in upon arrival we both burst out laughing. It was smaller than the hotel room we'd previously had downtown. The bed we affectionately referred to as ""the plank."" The kitchen is pretty average for Singapore. Rage top, sketchy convection oven/microwave combo and poor quality pots and utensils. I did note they used Wedgewood for the tea service. The furniture was an odd mish mash of Ikea, and faux Perkanan/Victorian. There was no dinner table, but then again who cooks here? It's Singapore. The pool area of beautiful, the gym is quite nice and all the staff were professional. We took advantage of the shuttle service and sometimes did the free breakfast downstairs. Compared to the Fraser Place location (where our friends were stationed at the same time) this location is really family oriented. There's nothing much to do within walking distance and we soon tired of the few local restaurants. As a wife staying here with a husband working I'd have preferred to be in the Fraser Place location as this was a bit too isolating. I would recommend it if you have kids under 5 and want to stick close to home and meet other moms. Our family stayed at Fraser Suites serviced apartments in Singapore (on River Valley Road) for the first month of our expat assignment in Singapore. I wanted to write a review particularly for families with small children. This is a great place for kids. It has an indoor ""Play Zone"" that is huge. Repeat: it is indoor! We took the children to the play zone at least twice a day. It is large, clean, and very well maintained. There is also an outdoor area with plenty of toys and an old sc hool video game room, which was great. The other highlight is the service. The staff at the front desk and housekeeping were great; but the cafe staff were exceptional. This is in a wonderful central location. It is connected to a mall with a Cold Storage grocery store and a Starbucks. Extremely convenient. Fraser runs many free private bus shuttles throughout the day -- to the business district morning/evening and to major shopping areas all day. We stayed in a two bedroom suite that had recently been updated. It was very modern, very nice. I am not sure that all of the rooms are renovated. I recommend you inquire about this when booking. This would be my only concern. The free breakfast, pool, gym, business center and other amenities were great as well. Let's get something straight: Fraser Suites has three separate properties in Singapore and has nothing to do with 'Great World' that the previous reviewer wrote about. The River Valley location is part of Valley Point Shopping Center. I have stayed with Frasers on numerous occasions for extended periods of time. They are a 'service apartment' hotel (for extended stays) and really don't court the nightly or a couple of nights market. This is also the tropics, so there are geckos (harmless, frightened lizards that eat insects) at times on the walls or ceilings (depending on your luck). The old-fashioned furniture mentioned in other reviews is the Peranakan style, or Straits Chinese (and Malay) style, which is being phased out for ultra-modern chrome and glass decor, sadly. It's a shame people come with such ignorances. Bottom line: the place is super clean, quiet, and with a ultra-friendly staff that will bend over backwards for you. The location is ideal for just about anything in Singapore and free transportation to major areas is provided. Five bus lines run outside the front door and cheap taxis are plentiful. The property is surrounded by shopping, local neighborhoods and a variety of nice restaurants to fit any taste or budget. If you aren't satisfied here, you can't be satisfied. Fantastic place to stay for families with children. Welcome was very warm and friendly. We were given a welcome hamper and the children each received a soft toy. This was totally unexpected and a very pleasant surprise as we had just got in after midnight. There is free scheduled shuttle bus to popular shopping areas so access will not be an issue. Full cooking facility if you need one. However close by are many restaurants catering for all taste. A convenient store is also located in the same area. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.",,,
daudratul,582702,"Great Hotel. The service is excellent starting from the reception. very good location for both the business travelers and the holiday makers. The welcome fountain at the lobby is really refreshing and the fresh flowers around the place really added value to the ambiance. The staffs are really noce and don't mind to offer their generous help to you voluntarily. The rooms are with amazing view, for both during the day and in the night. You can really enjoy the view of the waterfront harbor and the bay from the room. The beds are with the best linen I have ever enjoyed and the the bathrooms are really exceptional. For shopaholics, the Marina Square mall is just next to it. You can also enjoy the acquriam zoo which is nearby. The sap was amazing so does the sports bar. Would love to stay their again and again. had the opportunity to stay in this big but ""OK"" hotel as a stop over in Dubai. Staffs are friendly, rooms are ok and the food is OK too (unusual for a hotel in Dubai). The rooms were bit old fashioned again unusual for Dubai. The location is great. Very close to the city center. The toilets are bit faded out and gloomy. I won't recommend for any reason except for a stop over. 1 night sleep at an affordable price. For family members, be aware of this hotel and the locality. You may not like if you are travelling with your family. To feel the ancient venice in you room, to have a great view of the harbor and to visit the St.marcos with few steps, this hotel offers the best. The rooms are elegant and the interion of the hotel definitely gives the smell of maritime venice. The rooms are really clean with all the up in the clss amenities. The buffet breakfast can serve delicacy of every taste. Their coffee with milk (cafee latte) is really memorable. There are many good restaurants in shorter distance but like all other things in venice, the food is also overpriced. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming to extend their help. The view from the room was really excellent specially during the night. Would like to stay here again. Hotel Guerini provides the location to get a gondola at your convenience. I call venice the drawing room of Europe and i felt the hotel is situated like a sofa. The shops for souvenir and food are just around the hotel. There is also a money exchange nearby (if you shop crazy and run out of cash..lol) so you can always explore street stalls around your hotel. Walking towards Piazza San Marco could be an experience from the hotel. You will always see the tomb but will get you sometime to reach there, the multilingual staffs of the hotel can definitely be a help (though not much because of the city streets of venice). The rooms will provide you the aesthetics of the ancient venice rooms. The classic furnitures with modern amenities are good match. The beds are comfortable enough to give you a good sleep after spending the whole day like either marcopolo, or if you choose like Casanova. :P","I was just in Dubai to attend an exhibition there. I booked in Dubai Palm Hotel to spend my 3 nights. The hotel rooms and stuff are not bad they were average. The terrible thing that turned our stay to hell is the night clubs they have. They have I think more than 3 night clubs with more than 3 parts every night. The sound is very HORRIBLE and very loud to the extent that you can't relax, sleep or even do any thing form it. Our stay was BB. The breakfast is very very poor only 4 types of food. It wasn't a good experience to go there. I won't go there again. had the opportunity to stay in this big but ""OK"" hotel as a stop over in Dubai. Staffs are friendly, rooms are ok and the food is OK too (unusual for a hotel in Dubai).

You may not like if you are travelling with your family. I stayed here for three days and this was 8th time of my stay in dubai.I can explain here acceptable when you consider price. Most of the time I chose some place near city cener or Reghe. Therefore because I tried different location was fantastic. This location is very good place with good acess to shoopings and resturants. At first , the reception give my room 2 hours before chech in time and also upgrade my room from triple to swit free charge and therefore , it was warm welcome! the receptionist was not friendly , but she is informative and serious. About roon they are clean and acceptable but they are not luxurious. The lunch and breakfast was delicious but not variable. But the worst thing about this palce is no acsess to internet. Can you consider a place without internet in 21 century! in ground floor there are some discoo , therefore it is better to choose the third or fourth floor to stay , because of sound at night. in a nut shell I will return here! Unfortunately, the Hotel was in a prime location but the facilities and service is not at all good..... There are several bars on-site and makes me feel unsafe in the place. The smell in the corridors as well as in the room is terribble. To my surpirse, the Breakfast was aweful.... only boiled eggs and sausages with French Toast, no other viands... additionally, the venue is not conjusive for an early breakfast. just terrible you can not sleep until 2 am when bars are clossed because of load noise, spilliters leak water to the curtain and made it dirty , trust me do not test it no mistaking room here just mistake that daughter was disturbed and awoke to find staff member in room-he fled -hotel comment i know you will forgive it was mistake-MISTAKE YOU HAVING A LAUGH !! Ladies no way go here !! Lucky kids not woken !! And ladies not in good area very rough and very dodgy characters on street .Hotel basic ,smelly and pool area being dug up.Forget Dubai in summer and Ramadan believe me nothing pleasant about the experience-definetely wont be back even if win lotto",,,
SailorMom64,2515725,Son and I stayed here and the room was adequate and economically priced. Son and I stayed here and the room was adequate and economically priced.,"I am actually still in the hotel and writing this that should tell you how terrible it is!! Where do I start...Fist I show up early so I pay an extra $20 for early check in so they can ""clean"" the room according to them this means leave the pubic hair in the bathtub, the weed on the desk and in the drawer and hair all over the floor in the bathroom. Next they forget to tell you there's construction on the building so you will be woken up at 8am by the sound of a nail gun and generator running. They just turned off the water in my room to top things off!! So I went to check out today but they already had charged me for the day so instead of sleeping in my car I decided since I payed I may as well tuff it out. What a dump!! Lesson learned here and never again...""Quality"" Inn may have to change the name because there was ZERO quality involved...The people who rated this over 2 stars must be the ones who stayed in our room before we got here and high as kites!! Son and I stayed here and the room was adequate and economically priced. I made this reservation on line, so we arrived sight-unseen. We were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We wanted to be close to the Naval Base, since we were visiting family. The base was very close, kind of around the corner. The room was scrupulously cleaened each day. There was a quite adequate breakfast provided along with the room. The room was definitelty not luxurious, but it was a great place for our stay. The front desk immediately took care of a problem we had with the air conditioner. I would recommend thiis Quality Inn for people visiting the base and on a budget Reservation thru website; which was correct. Got a H/C room because it was the only ground floor room available. I had requested ground floor on reservation. Large room with great bed. Everything in the room worked. WiFi worked well once I learned the procedure. Ice machine was close by and was noisy when used, which was seldom, Very visible and close to I-5, but follow directions carefully to get into parking lot. Hot breakfast, boiled eggs, saugage, waffles, cold ceral, toast, pastries, oranges, coffee, tea, juice.",,,

The breakfast is average , not out of the world but not bad either Good bang for our buck! A fairly quiet backwater part of town, and a slightly rundown but pretty clean hotel. Staff was friendly enough (for New Yorkers), and really no complaints at all. It's only about a 20 minute walk to the subway, although they seem to offer a shuttle service (never saw one, though). For the price, this is certainly a decent place to stay if visiting NYC. Horrible hotel over priced not in good location rooms too small. The staffs where not friendly and not willing to guide and help the clients. The worst part was the breakfast, it was in a small room where everyone have to cramp in. They give us disposable plate and cup with which we really don't feel like eating. And the same menu repeat everyday. This hotel is near manhattan in queens. free breakfast, internet and shuttleservice. Very good price for NYC. I chose the hotel due to the free parking and cost, which was a tad high (US129) but acceptable since it was the long labor day weekend. Service seemed cold when I arrived early (busy day maybe?), but improved tremendously after lunch when I was allowed to check in early and got a room change to a twin double room which I had requested. The front desk was friendly and one can get free cookies too (late afternoon). The room itself was comfy, and well stocked with the amenities one would expect. The breakfast was nothing special, ending a tad early (6am-9am) so do not sleep in if you want catch it. My friend who had a more selective tastebud did not see anything he liked. Maybe due to feedback or cost, they have changed the shuttle service to a taxi service, and each room only gets to use it once a day. So one must always walk one trip between the metro. While it is a 15min walk, i do not recommend people to stay out too late due to the quiet streets that one has to walk through between the hotel and the station, Certainly do not recommend for people with families or young ones or even single female travelers. While the area is not an touristy spot, it has a nice charm and overlook a quiet and beautiful cemetery. The architecture of the hotel itself is also quite interesting. had to book it on short notice, was the only affordable place for those dates. located in queens, metro station can be reached walking about 15 minutes, from there's a train directly to time square, so it was pretty easy to get into the city. the area is pretty uninteressting except for this very, very huge old cemetary across the street which is great to take beautiful pictures as it has thousounds of statues and old tombstones. if you don't have a room facing manhattan you can get into the staircase and can take great photos of manhattan skyline. the hotel is relatively clean even though the interior and furniture are quite old. breakfast is good. there's a free shuttle to laguardia airport and to the metro station if you don't want to carry your luggage all the way. the driver was a very nice and funny guy ;) not my favourite place but if you don't expect too much, it's a good place. We were stranded in New York during the recent volcanic ash fiasco and ended up in the City View Inn. We were a party of 7 in two rooms for one week. What could have been a very unpleasant stay turned out to be much more pleasant mostly due to the treatment we received at the City View Inn. The rooms were immaculate and the women who cleaned them were very accomodating. The front desk staff were also extremely helpful. Although this hotel is a little way from the center of New York, it is only a fifteen minute walk to the subway and the hotel provides free transport. Also a fifteen minute walk away were some really interesting restaurants. I would definitely stay here again. I have been to this hotel several times in the last three years, because they pick you up at the Laguardia Airport and take you back, take and pick you at the Metro station and had a hot breakfast. Now the hotel has no van, got rid of the drivers while we were there and try to make you walk to the metro (takes 30 minutes) and denies you service to the Airport even though it's still included in the Best Western Hotels website. Guests had to keep asking for the manager to be taken to the metro station or back to the Airport. The manager didn't want to show his face due to the lack of service.. It's a pity since the hotel has very attentive corteous employees and to no fault of their own the impression of the hotel is lacking. Had to tell by phone to the manager that I was an old client since they didn't want to honor the website offer of travel back to the Airport. This is not the way to spend a vacation. Therefore beware. If you want to go anyway to his hotel anyway be prepared to argue and get mad as I saw several other guests doing. I heard it in English, French and German. Everyday was an adventure since you didn't know if they would order a taxi for you or if you had to walk. I had to walk four days out of six days. Beware also that if you get a taxi ordered by the hotel you have to tell them to include your bags, because otherwise you end up arguing with the taxi drivers that when you travel you do have suitcases, since the taxi driver told us the coupon just covered persons. Not a way to end a vacation travel. As soon as I arrived home I checked the website of the hotel, and they still offer transportation from and to the La Guardia Airport which you have to argue to get and transportation to and from the Metro station which they didn't give me four times out of six. Maybe if you take the fact sheet printout of the hotel you have better luck than I did. Good luck with it, because the justification for the lack of service was that they had cheaper rates.",,,
rslev,1478693,"My wife and I stayed here in April. It's a very nice hotel (beautiful decor - in the room and out) and the staff is quite helpful. We also liked some of the little touches, like the old bookstore (more of a library) on the 2nd floor and the gift shop of the Istanbul Modern (also on the 2nd floor). Also the wifi is free and very fast. We didn't eat dinner or lunch there but there are some nice restaurants across the street. But we did eat breakfast in the hotel, which is quite a spread. Also our views were just so-so (room 711 and then 603), but there might be others with better ones. I guess my only complaint is that the hotel is quite far north so if you are planning to spend a lot of time in Old Town this may not be the best choice, especially given how bad traffic is in Istanbul (when it rains it comes to a standstill). It's also fairly far from the airport. When there was no traffic (like 5am in the morning) getting to the airport was a breeze, but in the mid-morning rush hour it was quite long. Just something to keep in mind. Otherwise, I would highly recommend the hotel. Oh, one other note - we forgot to ask for a non-smoking room and the first room we stayed in (711) cigarette smoke was definitely noticeable (we didn't try airing out the room by opening the windows, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference as I'm sure occupants near by where smoking in their rooms). We then went to Cappadocia for a few days and when we came back to the hotel they put us in a non-smoking room (on the 6th floor) but it didn't seem to make a difference - the room smelled exactly like the one on the 7th floor. So if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke then perhaps this hotel isn't for you either. We stayed here the weekend of Thanksgiving, 2011. It's a very nice hotel. Nice decor, large room and very good location (right in the Inner Harbor). The staff was quite friendly and helpful. We really liked our stay here. They also offered free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, which was fast and easy to access. I have no real complaints, though the buffet breakfast was a bit disappointing (slow service, though they apologized and comped us the meal, and the quality of the food is just OK - may do better to walk to Fell's Point and have brunch out). We didn't try room service, but the hotel is attached to 2 chain restaurants (Ruth's Chris Steak House and McCormick & Schmick's) so I'm sure it's fine.","My wife and I stayed here in April.

Whilst there, I received a delivery which they brought to my room in my absence. The rooms a spacious and cosy and service included free Wifi. Everything was new and clean and even the gym has the latest equipment and is also well kept. The restaurant on the top floor has a stunning view of the Bosphorous and the buffets at breakfast and lunch had plenty of variety and tasted good. As I ate out in the evening, I cannot comment on dinner. For a business traveller this is a perfect hotel and has a business centre as well as conference facilities. I would definitely recommend it. This was my third stay at this hotel; two were for business. Although the hotel is far from the airport, it is almost at the center of the city where you can reach most of the places by taxi easily. If you are lucky to get a room with the Bosphorous view, you can enjoy the magnificent Istanbul during day and night. The breakfast area is at the top 18th floor with the same extraordinary view of the Bosphorous.The breakfast is open buffet with a wide variety of food. The rooms are clean, functional, big enough to enjoy the room, modern art all over the walls, very comfortable and most importantly the bed and the pillows are special for a good sleep; you can even make a choice from a pillow menu. The meeting rooms are also great for small meetings. The elevators are fun with the digital girl constantly doing funny face mimics- you donÃ¢â¬â¢t feel how the seconds past so easily even if you are going up to the top floor. Staff is very kind and friendly. And the best part; you have free Wi-Fi even in the room. Overall it is a very nice and comfortable hotel with reasonable prices. I stayed in this hotel very recently for business, hotel is very clean, the room is well maintained. Free wifi was excellent, swimming pool and the gym area also very good. The hotel located in good area, you can walk to exchange office-Starbucks-supermarket, and most famous shopping malls are nearby ( walking-Taxi or metro). All in all I can not think of one bad thing, and would go there again I was incredibly impressed by my recent stay at the point Hotel. The staff were not only incredibly professional but also very friendly and helpful. The quality of the room was better than I had hoped for. There was a lovely office area and sitting area with free very high speed Internet access. The bed was not only huge but very comfortable. Downstairs there is the biggest games room I have ever seen in my life in any Hotel !!! My teenage sons would have loved it Ã¯ï¿½Å  Also a very well equipped gymnasium and pool. Free to guests. there is a nice coffee shop in the lobby with a choice of different restaurants. Breakfast is served in the beautiful penthouse restaurant on the 18th floor which has a magnificent view over the Bosporus and the first bridge. It is within good walking distance of many of the shops, and there is a Starbucks about 50 meters away !! What more could you ask Ã¯ï¿½Å  Gerard I stayed in Point Hotel Barbaros in December 2011. The room was spacious and clean. The restaurant on the 18-th floor has fantastic view of the Istanbul, especially at the night. The service was excellent. I certainly will go again to this hotel. I stayed in room # 808 , the Bosphorus view is nice ...if you like urban style like me you will like it , location is very good for Business travelers the staff were extra helpful , service is fast and good ,thatÃ¢â¬â¢s what I liked about it , minor negative (points) like carpet vacuuming wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t that good and the decoration of the rooms was not as good as the lobby and the internal spaces , however it was pleasant 2 nights stay . I chose the Point Hotel Barbaros on the suggestion of a local partner and I must say I was very happy with the choice. The hotel is located close to Besiktas area, in a zone with intense real estate development. The view from the room was very good, overlooking the Bosphorus and one of the main bridges between Asia and Europe. Room was clean and adequate size, wi-fi was free in the whole hotel and service was very attentive. The only problem I saw was the heavy traffic in the area, but that is true also in many other area of Istanbul. I was there for a business trip in June 11 and as usually happen you have to find something before going out for dinner so I decided to accept a free hour for the game Zone floor. It is amazing , in the dark with many games spot , you can use PS/3 + car seat, adventure games and many others.( very nice also with friend or colleagues) you can lose your time down there ! There is also an hotel built around this floor of course !! very nice with a wonderful view of Istanbul during breakfast. Hotel personnel (mainly waiters during breaskfast/dinner) as always here, too many and not inclined to be take care the guest as should be . Nice room with huge shower and Wi fi free ..a must be ! Very nice, high quality hotel. Comfortable stylish rooms, perfect bed, great sleep. Excellent meal. The only thing frustrated me was the room light. I always kept seeking the approrpiate button, yet not all of them were working. The location is not good if you aim at sightseeing - you would need transportation. The shopping center - Astoria - is within walking distance. So, good luck for your stay in Point Barbaros! I stayed at Executive room. The room was very basic and its decoration was boring. The floor carpet and the walls are both grey color also poor lightenning makes it depressive.. The breakfast was disappointing, tasteless, cheap foods and the service is not satisfying. There were some small flies on some food on open breakfast buffet and it seems that it is not hygenic. The elevators of the hotel are not sufficent, too much waiting time for the elevators.. The hotel is far from major touristic attractions. Stayed several nights recently & this is a very good hotel. Plenty of positives ! Very modern, well equipped rooms, Some minor niggles only After working and walking down to the center of the nicely crowded Istanbul its always good to come back to a hotel where staff will welcome you and take good care. Its very convenient in terms of raching cabs and public transportation, but a little walking for like up 10-12 minutes is needed to Metro .. We stayed at this hotel for four nights in February as part of a work conference. The hotel is stunning, with all new modern features, modern art all over the hotel, lightning fast lifts, and very nice bars. The rooms were spacious with VERY comfortable beds - you even get a pillow menu to choose which kinds of pillows. The whole place has a decidedly ""W"" vibe to the place. There is house music playing in the elevator (you cannot and will not miss the digital woman in the elevator with you constantly winking at you and fixing her hair... very odd and talk-provoking piece of art). The closest fun Turkish neighborhood around is Besiktas (Besh-ick-TASH) but you are no where near Bebek, Sultanahmet, Taksim Square or any other must-see place in Istanbul. But, you're a short taxi ride away (depending on traffic). Overall, Point Hotel is great for work, and great of you if you don't mind location and want to be pampered in a nice, modern hotel. The bar/drinks are expensive, but not more so than any other nice place in Istanbul.",,,
Knows,294699,"I'm sure this used to be a nice little place. Very quaint, nothing fancy and a good location....before the clubs moved in. There are literally six open air bar/clubs beginning two doors down. They blast the music so loud, each trying to outdo the other, the windows in our room vibrated. My mistake, as I didn't check tripadvisor before securing a room here. We left after only two nights. Just couldn't take it and will never return. Don't be fooled into thinking the rooms off the road are more quiet. The music seems to echo and travel around the courtyard of this place. It's ruined this place, unless you like staying up until 5:30am, which is when the music and noise stopped. I stayed here one night on my way to Mexico. Check in was smooth and quick. The room was typical Marriott style, clean and spacious. We were able to walk out in the evening with plenty of dinner options close by.

It's ruined this place, unless you like staying up until 5:30am, which is when the music and noise stopped. Well part of it was my own fault not reading TripAdvisor! The title ""Sleeping in a Disco"" is right on. I arrived at midnight and all clubs were already in full swing. These clubs are right down the street and are one of the few ones opened till 4am. Immediately when I got here I was welcomed warm heartedly and told that noise would not be an issue they have double paned widows and then provided with ear plugs and instructed on how to use these. What brought me to the place was the location and also the style of the room, the Robinson Crusoe look. Well I got a different room a much bigger one but not want I had initially in mind. Another thing was the price, I was told that there is an extra 6% charge if I use my credit card. This was not indicated properly on the site, only if I pay cash will I not have this issue. The room was nice, staff very friendly, but if I had read TripAdvisor I would have picked up not only the noise issue each and every night of my 7 day stay but also the other complaints made about the sheets and mattress. In addition the bathroom sink had severe issues where the faucet was shorter then the basin making water leak all over the counter and difficult to place your hands under the faucet to get access to water. I am totally not happy with the place. When one goes on vacation you expect that what you pay for is clearly stated, any pictures that show the room your are booking is exactly or closely follow with what you choose up front and and that any extra charges or fees are clearly indicated. If this is not the case and they can not meet this then the hotel should let you know up front so you can make the right decisions up front and not have to deal with them on the spot during ones stay. Well it is what it is! I will definitely come back to Playa but their won't be an eclipse in mind! :) I must start out by saying the staff were wonderful and very kind. My husband and I were looking for a quiet serene place for this vacation, and although the court yard is lush it is not so quiet. If we were into the night life scene it would be perfect as there were 3 discos nearby. We had booked to stay for 15 nights but only stayed one as unfortunately we were placed on the ground floor which faced into the small court yard and everyone entering stared in our room, so we needed to leave the drapes closed, this left the room dark. No other rooms were available due to the Easter weekend. Since we are a middle aged couple who were looking for tranquility this was not the place for us as the discos can be heard till the wee hours of the night. If we were younger and wanting to enjoy the loud music and dancing you canot beat this location. The beach club is a fair walk away as well but there are so many places to rent a chair this is not really an issue. Our world traveller daughter would have loved this place. My husband and I stayed here two nights and really liked this hotel itself. The room was huge, very clean and a great rate, $90 night. We had a balcony, as well as access to the jungle courtyard. The only complaint is the noise from the clubs a block away made it very difficult to sleep. If you're a light to medium sleeper, I would suggest finding a place further away from the clubs (Blue Parrot, etc.) Well, to be honest...I'm not sure which was worse, the women next door loudly complaining about the noise all night or the music itself. ;) Our trip was 7 days long, around Yucatan. We stay at Eclipse for our first night, and it was very good night! After some days visiting Merida, Tulum, etc, we return to Eclipse, because it was the best place where we stay for all trip. Guys from reception Alehandro and Pedro are very helpful and friendly! The noise, starting at about 10 pm and escalated til about 4 am, most evenings I would imagine, ( I was there for two nights in the early week). This is now a mexican disco district, with lots of deep thumping riffs etc. etc. Go for it if this is your cup of tea.",,,
Joan M,2514266,"Great location ..........that's about the only positive thing ........room was average and very cold no heating had to ask for bathrobes carpet was dirty and bathroom very dated would not call this hotel a 5 star .........more a 3 star Despite reading the bad reports on this place before we stayed, we made a big mistake!! I dont think I have stayed anywhere as bad in my whole life and I have done some amount of travelling. Where to begin?!! Firstly we couldnt check in until 3pm, so we left our bags in there and had arranged to meet a member of staff at 3pm to get checked in etc. We waited in the rain and nobody showed up until 4pm. No apology, no excuse, nothing at all. We then went into the room, it was FILTHY, the bed hadnt been cleaned in ages and there was an awful smell.. We were given the bed sheets etc and did the beds ourselves. No toliet paper, no soap, and we were only given one small handtowl between my partner and I for 4 nights stay. Discracful. There was no reception desk there so we could not get any help from them at all. The room was so dirty and was very noisy (Being literally right beside Oxford Street) The only reason we booked this accomodation was that everywhere else was booked out for new years and it was the cheapest out of them all.. I would recommend anyone ever thinking of staying in this place, not to- its awful, it really is a filthy hotel Hotel itself is clean and comfortable. When you walk outside onto the sidewalk, it smells of garbage. Only 1.5 blocks from subway is very convenient. Continental breakfast is same as all other hotels with stale supermarket pastries/bagels, strange vat of hot food (discs of egg and sausage in perfect circular shape), waffle maker. I have a hard time eating that when there are so many great bagels to be had in NYC! Hotel itself is clean and comfortable. When you walk outside onto the sidewalk, it smells of garbage.

I have a hard time eating that when there are so many great bagels to be had in NYC! I've been staying in and recommending this place for years. It isn't a big chain, glamorous or sleek, you won't bump into any celebrities in the motel itself, but you might in Swinger's, the 24 hipster cafe attached to the place. Always clean, welcoming and a fairly recent remodel, I recommend it to any family or friends looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in a decent neighborhood. In all the years I've sent folks here, I've only heard rave reviews. For tourists, it's centrally located, so a trip to the Valley for Universal is reasonable - as is a trip to Santa Monica. You are a few blocks from Beverly Hills, a mile or so from the Sunset Strip and walking distance to some of the best restaurants in LA. Same goes for shoppers, close to Rodeo Drive, but also to all the cool Melrose shops, vintage stores, even the newly dubbed La Cienega design Quarter. Highly Recommend. The hotel Belleclaire was a life saver on a last minute trip to New York. The rate was great for NYC. This hotel is in a beautiful, safe neighborhood close to upper west side shopping, theater and restaurants and it is easy to get anywhere in the city from this area. The hotel is clean with great decor and the staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating to us out of towners! We highly recommend it!

I would recommend anyone ever thinking of staying in this place, not to- its awful, it really is a filthy hotel - Telephone number given online did not work - Nobody available at the hotel when we arrived, despite a scruffy note on the door saying reception would be open - Shoddy, messy, dirty front of hotel (little door) - Rude staff over the phone once contact made, little English spoken - Charged more than the full nights stay even though we had to find another hotel!! We have now contacted Budget Places.com regarding a refund. Very dissapointed. Dirty? yes! But at least, no wall-to-wall carpets and, as far as we could tell, clean sheats & no bugs. The location is great and the area safe, so we kind of took the filth with humour. Upon arrival, we had a thorough do-it-yourself cleaning session with the help of antibacterial wipes (cost us 10 minutes and two pounds for 2 packs of wipes). OK, the blackened chewing gum on the floor remained there and I therefore left my socks on most of the time. The shower curtain was indeed moldy, but the water hot. The toilet seemed ok clean, we nevertheless gave it an antibacterial swipe, too. The staff was ok & mostly friendly and since we arrived in the afternoon, we did not have any problem with the check-in. Good and affordable breakfast is served just across the little (car-free) square and Bond street underground at two minutes walking distance. Overall: The Ivanhoe is cheap and a bit strange, but we spent the money we saved on shopping & good food in town. I hope they soon get a grip or sell the place to someone else, because you actually could turn this into a pearl. Although it turned out to be an enjoyable London weekend for us, we will certainly look for another place to sleep the next time around. The only decent thing about this rat hole is that it's location is fantastic. 1 block from Oxford Street and all the shopping. Aside from that, AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS!!!! We're pretty sure it's never been cleaned in the past 10 years. It was so bad, that when we checked in (after a fight with the 'receptionist' on the phone, because the front door was locked with a scrap piece of paper taped to it saying 'call this number', all of which was never mentioned anywhere on the booking details, and we were forced to go find a phone to use to call) there was dirty towels, full garbages and just general grime all over the room from the previous visitor. The bed had been made up, but we weren't sure if it was fresh sheets, so we didnt even get under the blankets for fear of finding filth, and ended up using towels for blankets. (in addition, we had to go ask for towels and toilet paper because there were neither when we got into the room) The bathroom has mould everywhere and hair all over the floor and walls from previous vistors aswell. Basically, aside from the decent price, this place is absolutely disgusting and we would HIGHLY recommend not setting foot in it. We booked first night at Ivanhoe and we are glad we didn't book more. They never clean the place! There were dust all over the room and the fan in the ceiling has not been used for months. There was a 1cm layer of dust on it. Soaps were laying all over to hide some kind of smell. We can not recommend Ivanhoe Suite hotel because we didn't enjoy a second we stayed there. Old squeeky beds, dirty sheets, dirty bathroom. If you only care about location and a low price, this is for you. If you will be able to get a good sleep, clean towels, and a clean room, dont even bother! It's a dump! after walkin in the hot sun we found the Ivanhoe hotel,only to be told there wasnt a room 4us and we were given the address of the Berkeley hotel a good 30mins away...it was hot n stuffy,with no facilities 4a cup of tea/coffee,not even a glass 4 sum water,there were springs sticking out of the bed..only good thing was the shower! dont go there..",,,

It's ok if you are staying 1 night,","I stayed in this place at the weekend with my daughter who had actually booked the nearby Comfort hotel. Due to total confusion, we ended up at this sister hotel as they had no rooms at the comfort which is another story. We were given the twin room, number 2 on the third floor. It is without doubt the worst place I have ever stayed in or even seen. The carpets were dirty and full of mould as were the skirting boards. The beds had no head boards, with only one sheet and a bed spread which with it being December and with little or no heat, made for a very cold night! The television was missing a panel by the infa red light exposing bare wires, the table top fridge was on the floor and there was not one piece of furniture to put clothes in. I would go as far to say that the bathroom was a health hazard. The shower head was totally encrusted with mould and limescale and by the time we had both had a shower, the tray was overflowing, the door even fell off as I closed it! The sink had no plug and the entire room was full of mould. Perhaps the most disturbing fact though,is that being on the third floor, there was no fire escape except down the stair case, with an AFFF extinguisher only being available on the landing below.the instructions in case of fire were in a frame with broken glass and very sharp shards sticking out. I f I could, I would have given it a big fat 0. Please do not stay here. I intend to take the matter further. Stayed for 1 night with hubby, we were going to a concert in the Shepherds bush 02.

jimjade3,223104,"We had reservations in Nashville but due to a blinding rainstorm, we made our way to this hotel for the night. It seemed nice enough from the exterior and the clerk was courteous. We were grateful they had a room and at sixty something dollars, it seemed okay. They had no luggage cart so we made several trips from car to room. In the corridor was this big furry blob. Relieved that it was not a rat, we found it to be a pile of hair extension. There were arguments coming from the neighbor's door in languages I've never heard. We got into our room and found it, like some others on this site, pretty nasty. Dirty, stained carpet and similar condition for the furniture. There was moldy caulking in the bathroom. It was the kind of place which makes you wonder if an owner lives in a place which is this bad, if he just doesn't want to make any improvement, or if he is just clueless. The worst part was that we had to get up at 4 a.m. to make it to our reserved tour at Mammoth Cave.... and the front desk did not honor our request for a wake-up call and the alarm clock did not work either. This place was disgusting. We just spent a week at the Marmara. It basically is a mid-later twentieth century apartment building converted to hotel. The apartments surprised me. They are attractive, well maintained and very spacious. The full kitchen is large, windowed and well equipped. It's not just a suite, but a well laid out apartment with bath off the hall and not the living room or bed room, so nobody wakes up the other enroute. The service at the front desk is friendly but minimal. One young (looked like) student usually manned the desk and was trying to manage phones, check-in and questions. Don't stay there if you are used to having one of those great concierges staffs, though the desk clerk will do his best to help. There was a friendly security/bellman on duty and visible always. There is a large laundry room and even larger gym in the basement, however the emplyees smoke down there and the air is a little foul. A large grocery is a couple blocks away. The neighborhod is really nice. We had a view of the river. There is 2nd ave subway construction adjacent but much of the work is underground now and the noise didn't bother us. (you might ask for an east oriented room or a high room just in case some above ground work is underway) The area actually seemed less touristy and more residential in feeling than where we usually stay on the west side. The transportation is not as easy as much of the west side, though it sure wasn't bad. The local Lex subway stop is 4 blocks away and here is where you start to notice that all Manhattan is not flat. You have a steep couple of block climb up Carnegie hill to Lexington but a nice coast down when you are coming home. My family will for sure press me to stay at Marmara next trip. They loved it... and it proved a fair cost savings over the my usual west side hotel for much more space.

Every corner of this room was covered in stains of Lord only knows what. There were so many stains on the bedding and couch my husband had to go buy sheets at Wal-mart for us to sleep and sit on. Air conditioner was broken. Bedroom lights were broken. Air unit was covered in filth, grime and mold and was missing pieces. The tub had a large, yellow/brown sludge in it--so dirty we refused to shower. Our non-smoking room had apparently been smoked in by every previous tenant...ashes everywhere and an overwhelming smoke odor that burned our eyes and caused coughing. The common areas were just as filthy as the room. I had my two year old with me, and would not let him touch anything or sit anywhere unless it was covered by the bedding we purchased. We would have checked out the minute we saw the room if it wasn't midnight. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! I found a really great rate for a Thursday night. I thought, hey! How bad can it be? Hmmm. Looks/smells as though a college fraternity or out-of-control rock band partied hard in this room. Stains all over the hallway, missing chunks of wall, dresser drawers broken off, warped sofa bed, refrigerator containing last guest's trash, We would have asked to switch rooms, but we barely had enough time to sleep a full night after 12 hours in the car and two hours visiting an old friend in town. Plus, what we saw in the hallways indicated we wouldn't fare much better in another room. STEER CLEAR of this hotel. Seriously. I would have paid double for a different room at a different hotel.

This place was disgusting. I stayed for 5 days & 4 nights. The room was clean, spacious and modern. The staff was friendly and courteous. My family and I came to Memphis for the International BBQ Festival and had a ball. I have no regrets and have determined that I will only stay at Extended Stay Hotels from this point on weather for leisure or business. The pool was not open for our stay and I never asked why, but that would be my only small dislike just wanted my 3 grandsons to enjoy the pool they were kind of looking forward to it. Our original reservation was two miles down the road at the sister Hotel Studio Suites. When we arrived we were told that they no longer had the double bed with sleeper sofa that we had reserved a week prior. We were told that the flood victims were taking the rooms. I'm ok with that I understand emergencies happen. So we had two options #1 take a room there with 1 queen bed and sofa bed or #2 transfer to the sister Hotel Extended Stay Deluxe. We went with option #2 after being told that the Extended Stay was much nicer, breakfast included, and outdoor pool. When we arrived we were really excited it had really looked like we had upgraded and still kept the good rate. DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER- Our first room had huge stains in the carpet and the counter tops were dirty in the kitchen. We called the front desk and then were escorted to another room that was still in need of a good carpet cleaning and a fresh paint job and the air was not cooling the room. We were then upgraded to a 2 room suite at no charge the only perk here was that we had to televisions. We gave up and stayed in the suite but I hated it and if I could do it over again I would of canceled the reservation and gone somewhere else. Couch was filthy ( I put a blanket over it to sit on) Carpet was worn dirty ( we wore our socks the whole time) Sheet had stain on it ( I changed it out with the front desk) No DVD in Room as advertised Cabinets and walls look beaten IN NEED OF Paint Job Bathroom was disgusting-- Believe it or not I had to clean it myself Rusty bathtub Our Free Breakfast consisted of muffins, Fruit, and coffee Never Again Ceanliness is a MUST HAVE I will not make the same mistake twice!!",,,

The shower curtain had mold, water was dripping in tub, dirt, all over the floor. The beds were hard as a rock(spring coming through mattress) we asked for more towels, took them forever to get them. this was by the worst place i have decided to stay.!!! next year i will spend 300+ for a room!! disgusting place to stay. the only thing was missing was bed bugs, then you would have had ever nasty thing possible! to top it all off....everyone is sick since we came home. maybe mold infested bathroom? NEVER AGAIN!!! We stayed here between 6-9th April 2012. The hotel has ~ 60 rooms on 6 floors with lift and stair access. We stayed in very nice dluxe rooms on 5th floor with balcony and views over Boulevard Raspail. The hotel is a 20 minute ride from Gare du Nord on tube line 4 with no changes required. It is then 100 metres from either Raspail or Vavin tube stations. The hotel is in a relatively quiet residential area (Montparnasse) with lots of shops, restaurants, cinemas and good transport links to the main sights. The local attractions include Tour Montparnasse with views over Paris from the 59th floor, the Montparnasse cemetery and the Catacoombs. We loved staying in this hotel. Nice rooms, no noise, friendly staff and nice buffet breakfast. There is no restaurant as such. There is wifi and free computer access. Coffee and papers are provided in the small lounge. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We will definately stay here again as we like the hotel and it's location. We can't wait to come back. Perhaps without the children next time ! I just spent 7 days at this palce and a LOT needs to be done to this property in order for this to be worth the money spent. The facility is run down , all of the couches in the main area, and chairs are broken down and you sink to the floor when you sit in them. The bar stoools are also very uncomfortable and the liquor is all watered down.. the drinks taste weird because of this. ( if you want a good drink go into town). We were out of hot water for 24 hours and the bathroom sink woudl not drain. Lights in the room was not working, the fan did not work, and beds are hard as a rock. And if you think you are going to rest in the morning, wait til the staff carts and BS, starts at 6:00 in the morning. There are many more , better, placed in this area to stay. The pictures on their site are not representative of their rooms. This is a 1 STAR hotel, at best. There are no services. No porter. No turn-down service. No Internet capability in rooms. The petit dejuner is NOT included in the room charge, and is a major surprise for its quality. Smoke permeates the building as does the odor of disinfectant and DDT! A plus are the staff.

Three weeks prior to our arrival all the hotels I checked had no vacancy until I found Edan roc. I felt lucky they had availability. Now I know why. To begin with I thought it unusual I had to send a check for one day to hold our reservation. When we arrived we had to pay for the remaining 3 days up front.Again unusual. We went to our room. the porch was 12 inches wide with a broken chair. Red flag. In the room 2 beds. Sqeaky and soft, no blankets, no tissues, no hair dryer, no iron, towels were small, thin and like sand paper and no coffee pot,no clock.Paying for ice was the kicker. Noticed all the hotels in the area had no vacancy signs except Edan Roc. What a surprise. I thought it was over priced for what they offered. the only positive was that it was close to the boardwalk and beach. Parking was at a premium. Great price for the location. We stayed in the Motel part which is right behind the boardwalk. There is also efficency apartments on the boardwalk. Check in was smooth. Staff, for the most part kept to themselves, unless you had a question or request. We asked for pillows and got them right away. The room was very clean. The pool was very nice and clean. Our room was poolside and I saw the staff cleaning and vacuming the pool every night. There was some comotion from another room and the staff, with the police resolved quickly. (However, we didn't mind too much. Free entertainment.) I think the only thing we didn't like was that you had to pay for the use of the ice machine. This is definately not an upscale motel, but your not paying for one. I'm sure we will stay again. Start off by saying, when we got into the room. The shower curtain had mold, water was dripping in tub, dirt, all over the floor. The beds were hard as a rock(spring coming through mattress) we asked for more towels, took them forever to get them. this was by the worst place i have decided to stay.!!! next year i will spend 300+ for a room!! disgusting place to stay. the only thing was missing was bed bugs, then you would have had ever nasty thing possible! to top it all off....everyone is sick since we came home. maybe mold infested bathroom? NEVER AGAIN!!! We are two adult sisters and their mom, and we go to Ocean City every fall for a few days. We like to stay on the Boardwalk for the convenience (and because it isn't crowded after Labor Day). Last year we were at a nicer hotel, but the price...let's just say, we were looking to save some money and have more to spend on steamed crabs! So we gave the Eden Roc a try. The room was large, but the space is odd---it's a long, narrow room with two beds and a sofa-sleeper against one wall. Bathroom was clean, kitchen was clean, liked the full size fridge. The decor and bed linens are best described as ""tired."" Everything was clean, it just felt dumpy. The balcony is not private, but we were there in off-season, so had it to ourselves anyway--but that might be an issue for some. We loved being on the boardwalk, steps away from the beach. This place had the best price by far for an ocean-front efficiency on the boardwalk, but I think we'll spend the extra money and go back to the nicer hotel next year. Bottom line is, we aren't as budget-conscious as we thought. But for people looking for a great price and a great location, this place might be perfect. We arrived around 11 and check-in was not until 2 but our rooms were ready and they allowed us to check-in early. The rooms were fairly clean we killed a spider and that was the only one we saw. There were no other bugs or bed bugs that bothered us. The lampshades and pillows were stained but I always bring my own pillows. The hotel employees were very helpful for anything we needed. The parking was a little scarce but if nothing at the hotel was available they gave us a parking pass to park in the parking garage right next door. They rent bikes for the boardwalk in the morning. My only real complaint would be about the pool. The kids were very unruly. There are a list of rules on the pool gate and I think not a person was obeying. They had glass bottles, floating devices and balls which none were allowed. The kids chased each other and ran around until one fell and hit his head on the concrete. Not one employee came in and said a word to any of these kids. Sure they were having fun and I have kids of my own but for some of the older foks staying there it was an inconvience for them. But overall it was cheap and not to shabby and a half a block from the beach and boardwalk. We would definately stay again! Low budget motel, good location, but dirty and not worth being attacked by bed bugs. Limited parking; had to drive around for 30 minutes to find a parking spot on arrival. I really didnt think that it would be too bad to stay in this place, i was a little raggedy looking but i could see past that, what i couldn't get over is how damaged and rundown the rooms were and how rude the management is. It even brought my girlfriend to tears on how mean their staff is. We had to complain twice because the cleaning ladies didn't touch our room and when we confronted the office about it they yelled and blamed it on us. i would never stay at this motel again no matter how good the cost is!!!",,,
motohachi,252650,"Although you don't hear street noise, one crying baby really disturb your sleep. Staff was very nice and room was clean. Price was great - small room with 2 people costs only 370 pesos/night. Stayed 1 night. Only good thing is that he room is huge and the staff are friendly. Carpet was really old and dirty. They said we can use internet in the room, but hardly any signal. While we're in the elevator, the elevator got stuck. There seems to be some lobby renovation going on, but the contractors are constantly smoking in the lobby so very bad air. I will not stay here again.","Although you don't hear street noise, one crying baby really disturb your sleep. Staff was very nice and room was clean. Price was great - small room with 2 people costs only 370 pesos/night. Positives: - 5 minutes walk from the zocalo - 3 minutes walk from the nearest metro (Allende) - 2 minutes from main shopping street/Starbucks:) and bars - nice staff - helpful and English-speaking and patient with our attempts to speak Spanish - basic, but clean rooms, with a daily cleaning service Negatives: - rooms have windows to the main hall - this is not a problem privacy-wise in terms of what you see (curtains), but a big one in terms of what you hear. Rooms are separated from the hall with the some kind of an open window. BRING YOUR EARPLUGS - that way you can have a peaceful night. Otherwise you will be forced to listen to the drunken songs of other guests, the hotel staff does not seem to care much. The bigest advantage of this hotel is itÂ´s location - 200 or 300m west from the Plaza Mayor, close to several Metro-stations, lots of shops and eating possibilities within short walk-distance. The rooms are basic but clean, hot shower, TV and even safe represent satisfactory equipment for this low-price category of accomodation. The main problem is the construction of the hotel (majority /if not all/ room-doors lead to the same huge ""quasi-atrium"" whereas the doors allow the noise to come out or in. Due to that you can share for free all imaginable TV programs (at the same time) and later on (espetially on weekends when many couples use the rooms for few hours only) judge the quality of sexual life of your twenty ""nearest neighbours"". The hotel is a good choice for people who primarily intend to enjoy the night life of Mexico city and bad option for those who want to rest after strenuous day. We stayed here for a few nights, great central location, nice rooms, two computers with internet. Big comfortable rooms with thick walls. We took one of the king sized rooms with a view of the street, it was cheaper and (in my estimation) nicer than the ""plus"" rooms we saw, which were more costly. Though there was a lot of street car noise in the am. Hotel Principal in Mexico City means business. They are polite without being intruding, clean without cleaning you out and always completely safe in a very chaotic environment like any city of over 25 million people can be. They have four different floors which would fit any budget, but even the cheap rooms are clean and the shared bathrooms, although inadequate for a full house, remain clean most of the time. They have free wi-fi and a very efficient crew that will always stay out of your way. Most of the cheap rooms are taken by traveling merchants and artisans and backpackers. The larger rooms are usually occupied by families or more affluent people. Don't think of this as a luxury or even a boutique hotel. This is a hotel in the more traditional sense, where you can find a bed and a shower for very little money, yet very decent. One of the drawbacks of course is that being in the center of the largest city in the world, from time to time and depending on your room you may find it noisy, but who comes to Mexico City to sleep? Located close to the Zocalo, this hotel is close to the busyness of the city, especially late at night, so if you're a light sleeper, this might not be the best place for you. However, everything was clean and the service was great...I would definitely recommend. I'll start by saying that, if you are looking for a basic and affordable option in the center of Mexico City, then I highly recommend Hotel Principal! The location can't be beat (right between the Zocalo and the Alameda, relatively safe, close to everything, and easily accessible by metro stops Allende or Bellas Artes, by taxi, or on foot), and I paid just $33 USD per night for a king-size bed! The rooms are very basic, and a little worn (a burn from a clothes iron in on the carpet and a cigarrette burn in one of the blankets). But it is clean and the staff is friendly and changed our sheets and towels every single day. Some complaints I saw from other travelers (noise, TV remote controls, etc...) were not a problem for me. And really, if you are expecting something better for less than $35 per night in the center of Mexico City, then you simply have unrealistic expectations. We were generally happy with our three-day stay. We loved the location and the staff were pleasant. We chose room 303 because of the large windows opening onto the street. However, there was an extremely noisy nightclub very close by which provided more background noise than we would have liked. I stayed one night 23 january, in the renovated and new rooms in the 4th floor. i got room number 417 was clean, New and with a King size bed, there was a safe box available for a 20usd deposit and returned when check out. 2 bottles of water each day, and an inmaculate bathroom. the location is SUPERB right in the downtown area just 4 blocks from cathedral and zocalo, in the middle of a pedestrian street called MADERO full with restaurants, bars, entretaiment, shops and police men walking there 24 hours 7 days a week. Latinoamericana tower just 2 blocks ahead. Delicious TACOS AL PASTOR right in the front of the Hotel: SALON CORONA you have to try POTZOLLCALLI restaurant near the hotel and try THE POZOLE ROJO WITH PORK MEAT was awesome i want more and more. if you stay in the proper hotel ask for a renovated room in the 4th floor and you wont be disapointed TRUST ME. I had a room with two beds for three women on four separate nights in late April and found this hotel to be the best value for the dollar I've ever spent on a room, but ONLY after we switched rooms. If you book a room at this hotel, be sure to insist on having an end room - the rooms on either end of the building facing the street are enormous, with great bathroom facilities, high ceilings and comfortable beds. The rooms on the interior of the hotel are dorm-style hostel rooms in which the shower in the bathroom proper and the beds have thin pillows. Additionally, the noise from the hallway into the interior rooms is vastly more intrusive than the street noise in the end rooms. The location of this hotel is a major selling point. It is in the Centro Historico with one block walk to the Bellas Artes area and two blocks to the Central Zocalo and major historical landmarks. Mexico City is hugely spread out geographically, so you can book a private car (priced slightly higher than a taxi but still reasonably) from the man at the front desk - it is a 15-minute ride to Zona Rosa, Roma and a bit further to Polanco. There is a great Metro station three blocks away, and charming places to eat breakfast or go dancing, and great bakeries all in the neighborhood. An additional selling point at this hotel is the hospitable front desk help who, though they spoke little English, muddle through our medicore Spanish to change hotel rooms, pay our bills, book cars and get directions. Also, there is a restaurant next door that, although it caters mainly to tourists, has sangria that will knock your socks off. I would recommend this hotel for location, value, and hospitable service.",,,
Bowden68,1592809,"When I first got to the hotel, I was impressed with the lobby. Nice tile floors, a couple restuarants, just a big city feel to the place. However, when I got to the rooms, well, what a dump. Carpet was stained all over the place, beat up bathrooms, stained walls, antiquated TV and loud AC unit. I travel extensively for business and this was arguably the worst room I have stayed in. The only bright side of the room was the bed, which was comfortable. I can't believe Crowne Plaza would let their rooms this bad. Especially in a high profile city like LA. If it was not for the lobby, I'd give it one star. I did get it for $50 a night on priceline. Not recommended at all. I usually stay downtown when I go to Indianapolis. But the Final Four was there and everything was sold out. I had an early meeting so I was fortunate to get something this close as it was less than five miles. The area is a little beat up, but not what I would deem ""unsafe"". The hotel istself was fine. It's an older property and I doubt it was a Holiday Inn when it was built. But the hotel was renovated and the rooms are clean, though a little small. There is a nice indoor pool and the property has no elevator. I paid the rack rate of $90 a night as priceline was not really taking bids due to the final 4. Would I stay here again? Probably not as I can priceline a 4 star hotel downtown for $50 most nights. But for one night, it was fine. 3 stars. When I first got to the hotel, I was impressed with the lobby.

Look, it's a Fairfield Inn and that makes it one of Marriott's lowest end property. I usually only like to stay at Courtyard and above, but I knew this was a newer property so I gave it a chance. Place is very clean, with a Fridays connected to it. So that was nice. The rooms were tiny but modern with a new 32"" flat screen TV. I stayed in a room with two beds, and they were double beds, not queens. I would not want to stay in a room this small with an extra person as it would be crowded. Not a lot of frills, but clean, new and a good value. There is a Courtyard next store and I would probably elect to stay there next time as I prefer a larger room. I pricelined this room and got is 2.5 stars for $45 a night. Excellent new Courtyard. This is the ""new version"" of Courtyard with a very modern feel to it. Very cool lobby. Rooms are good size, and very comfortable with a huge desk, so if you are a business person you will appreciate that fact. Large workout center, a pool and cool restuarant and bar area. I got this hotel for $50 a night on priceline, 3 star. Only downer was parking which was $20 a day. But that is the going rate downtown. Also, there is a Fridays attached to the hotels. Cool place to stay","After several less-than-satisfactory hotel stays in the last while, it was such a breath of fresh air to stay here. Where to begin? The staff is fantastic... every single member is friendly, accommodating and helpful; be it the valet, the check-in, the food counter, etc. Kudos to them. The hotel itself is clean, pleasant-looking and functional. The internet was very good throughout the property (note, I paid extra for better internet service). The food counter was very handy for a coffee, or a pizza at night, and the small marketplace (shelves of water, chocolate, chips, etc.) is also great for a quick snack. My king room was clean and, again, functional. Everything that is needed was there. The thermostat was easy to operate. And here's something I absolutely love: More often than not, after spending time removing all the pillows and bedding I don't want, housekeepers usually put everything back on to make everything ""pretty"", which annoys me, because every night I have to go through the same workout removing everything all over again. Not here! Housekeeping blessedly left aside everything I had removed from the bed, so when I was ready to go to bed, I could GO TO BED. Thanks so much for this small, yet very significant practice. And while the hike to the convention center can be a little onerous from this location, it is possible to do it entirely indoors. A few suggestions for improvement: One reviewer is correct in suggesting better shampoo bottles. Also, my king mattress has started sloping to one side, so I couldn't sleep in the middle of the bed. Another reviewer points out the pool is quite small. I did not use it, but could easily see that it is rather tiny. Might be best to replace it with one large hot tub. That would be great! I will stay here again. My husband and I did a weekend getaway in Indianapolis to see the Cirque du Soleil show and I found this hotel to be conveniently located downtown and decently priced compared to some other hotels in the area. It offers an indoor pool which we didn't utilize but there were always people down there--it's a bit small though. I loved that it was right across the street from several museums and you didn't have to worry about driving and parking there because you could just walk. The staff is very friendly and did everything they could to make sure our stay was pleasant. There's a skywalk that leads to the JW Marriott as well as the convention center. We had a nice king bed room with a view of the baseball diamond and state park. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious enough for the both of us. All in all we will definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Indy. Stayed during a long weekend business function and couldn't be nicer. Attached to JW Marriott & convention center plus we received an 'event rate' that was awesome! Never had to go outside; Starbucks on the property; yummie restaurants as well. Quiet and within walking distance of downtown only 6 blocks away Stayed here during Super Bowl week. I found the mattress and pillows to be somewhat uncomfortable as opposed to some of the Hampton Inns I've stayed in. The hotel appears to be relatively new and the service was good. The small shampoos stocked in the room are a pain to open, they need to find an alternative. The parking was inconvenient and the attendants were okay, retrieving my car in a reasonable time period. I booked a room because I had to go to IU Medical Hopsital. The room was beautiful!!! We were in room 419. Very clean, and the ambiance was nice. Unfortunately, during my stay, I was bitten by bed bugs all over my body. I caught one crawling across the top comforter and put it in a paper cup and put it in a paper cup and took it down the the front counter. The gal I talked to was very nice, but was very disappointed that I heard nothing from manager, no concern at all. Very upset because the hotel is beautiful, the room was beautiful but had bugs. I booked a last minute stay for a sporting event at Lucas Oil Stadium. The hotel was full, but it didn't affect the excellent service we received. Check-in was efficient, staff was friendly and helpful the entire stay. Our room was clean and very quiet-this in spite of the fact that our room was near the elevator and a college marching band was staying on our floor. I enjoy having the Courtyard Bistro in the lobby. They brew Starbucks coffee and you can grab a yogurt parfait & muffin to go, or order hot food to eat in. They serve complimentary cookies in the afternoon. This location is perfect for downtown activities. You can walk to numerous restaurants, the convention center and sporting events. The convention center is accessible via skywalks. Clean, quiet, great location and a top-notch staff! I'll stay here again the next time I'm in Indianapolis. I love Courtyard Indianapolis Downtown. We enjoyed yet another lovely stay in June, spending a weekend in Indy enjoying the many museums, gardens, and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. (I discovered yet another perk of this conveniently-located hotel. We were able to walk just a few blocks to the canal where we enjoyed a leisurely kayaking trip!) Our room was beautifully clean and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and allowed us to enjoy free parking for the entire day after we checked out, so we were able to enjoy the amazing orchid show at the White River Gardens before we got back on the road again. I love this hotel. I will never stay anywhere else while in Indy. This is a very convenient complex that includes 4 Marriott hotels -- JW, Courtyard, Fairfield and SpringHIll Suites--all of them connected by an indoor walkway. There are several restaurants on-site including a TGI Fridays and a Starbucks. There is also a small bistro right inside the Courtyard that serves sandwiches, salads, drinks, etc. Front desk and bistro staff were very helpful and courteous. Rooms are clean and well-furnished. I especially liked the security feature where you are required to use a room key to take the elevator to the upper floors. Parking garage was a bit confusing but was OK once you figured out which entrance you needed. Hotel is very close and within waking distance to most Indy attractions and restaurants. This Courtyard is a new build and is quite stylish and very nice. Checking is the desk attendant was very friendly and gladly changed my room type to a King instead of two doubles. The elevators were always fast and did require a room key for an added layer of safety. The hallways were bright and attractive. The room continued this trend. It was large, clean and modern complete with well designed furniture, a flat screen tv with real HD programming, clean carpeting and a super comfortable bed. There were plenty of spare outlets for Ipods, laptops and cell phone charging. The bathroom was also quite nice with a marble vanity and a walk in shower that had a great shower head and water pressure. The location was very safe and all of the downtown features and attractions were easily walkable. Parking in the garage was a bit of a challenge as it is slightly undersized considering it has to house parking for three different hotels. Finding a spot was next to impossible on a Tuesday morning. Overnight parking was a somewhat reasonable $23. Overall you can't go wrong with this Courtyard. Staff members were efficient and friendly and the hotel itself is new and well taken care of. I stayed at the hotel for two nights while in town for business. My meetings were at the JW Marriott, which is connected so I didn't even have to venture outside. The hotel feels brand new and the rooms and lobby are spotless and fresh. The bathroom is large, with a nice big counter to spread out your stuff. I stayed on the 15th floor and had a nice view of the museum across the street. Great hotel - - no complaints at all. Excellent new Courtyard. This is the ""new version"" of Courtyard with a very modern feel to it. Very cool lobby. Rooms are good size, and very comfortable with a huge desk, so if you are a business person you will appreciate that fact. Large workout center, a pool and cool restuarant and bar area. I got this hotel for $50 a night on priceline, 3 star. Only downer was parking which was $20 a day. But that is the going rate downtown. Also, there is a Fridays attached to the hotels. Cool place to stay We spent a nice night on the town and the retired @ THE NEW MARRIOTT COURTYARD. The young lady @ check in was VERY PROFESSIONAL. The hotel faced Lucas Oil Stadium & Victory Field. +++THE VIEW WITH THE LIGHTS WAS VERY COOL! +++ VERY SWANKY ACCOMMODATIONS! ALL NEW! I had a couple of very small complaints . The toilet in our room RAN ALL NIGHT. Any playing with the handle would not stop it. Another thing I did not like was I felt paying $25 for over night parking was like paying a hidden fee. However, I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AGAIN. Nice place to stay in downtown Indy. We stayed here 2 nights for the state final basketball tournament. We got an excellent price using priceline.com Only problem was that the glass shower door did not close properly and water leaked onto the floor. I love that is is brand new and the entire hotel is smoke free!! Parking was expensive at $20 per night.",,,

It's clean and modern but the rooms are absolutely tiny! We had four to a room which had two double beds, with four peoples luggage it was impossible to keep tidy!

The apartment was never really clean properly either, there was dust on all the furniture and the curtains were filthy with stains all over them. The kitchen was okay but there was very few utensils.

They are great apartments and very good value for Dubai. Fully equipped kitchen, very comfy beds, an individual wifi hub in every apartment, not bad TV channels with good TVs. There is not a lot of difference between deluxe and standard. In standard maybe the furniture is older. In some apartments there are two bathrooms. Large living room, good wardrobes space in the bedroom, We have been living here for two months and will stay for a year. the staff are very helpful and friendly. The manager will give a very good monthly rate. Can highly recommend these apartments. They are a 2 minute walk from the Metro. If anything goes wrong in the apartment, just call reception and they guy comes to fix it within about half an hour. I booked a 3 night stay through E-bookers, and somehow when I checked in, they did not have my booking. However, it was sorted out while I went out to dinner and I was accomodated. The rooms are large apart-hotel type rooms with a two TVs, a kitchen, a large bed, a sitting room etc. Iron & Ironing board available, wifi (not free) and the bathroom was decent. The shower pressure and temperature was dodgy as was the overall decor of the room. However, it did its job. I was there for a brief weekend and I did not spend a hole lot of time there. The staff were very friendly and efficient (despite the initial issue with the booking). I did not eat there and it did not look like many people do but it seems to have a full restaurant service. Location: I do not know Dubai that well but will be as descriptive as possible: It is a five minute taxi journey or a 5 minute metro ride to the Dubai Marina. On the other hand, it is approximately 10-15 minutes in a taxi to the CBD i.e. where the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall are etc. The access to the Metro has to be a plus if you are not prepared to use taxis all the time (right beside the Internet City Metro), however, there is not a whole lot to do in the area which is called ""Dubai Internet City"". It was approximately 60 D's from the airport, which works out at about Â£12. My overall opinion of this place can be summed up as follows: If you are a business traveller and the company is paying for you: Don't go here. If you are a tourist and you are not too fussed on your accomodation but like a clean, safe and handy hotel, then this place is not too bad. I'd recommend it on that basis. Extremely unprofessional, no respect for customer. Be careful while booking, they used to double charging and never refund or admit their mistake. I stayed there first for 1week and then came back to stay for a month, you get all what you get in a four star hotel, good and big rooms at best price, very friendly staff, always there to help even you stay for a long there, best thing is location which I saved about hell of money as taxi in dubai is very expensive and I dont drive, Metro is the big advantage, I was able to reach every morning in my office just in 15 minutes, Housekeeping, reception, restaurant staff very courteous, If you have a chance or can afford another hotel i would strongly recommend as there are many other Hotels much better around and with the same or even better prices than Legacy.The location is convenient and close to the metro station, however probably this will be the only benefit.During my stay at Legacy everyday i had to wakeup like i slept inside the kitchen as the food smell was too strong and sometimes my room was smelling cigarette smoke coming from the air conditioning probably.The cleaning was not that good , sometimes the towels had an unbelievable hole in the middle , they rarely clean the furniture to remove the dust and even sometimes the cleaners didn't come, if you try to call the reception to ask what happened they alleged that so many rooms did the checkout and they had no time to clean the others.As another review already commented here they change the services at their convenience, instead of daily cleaning they changed to 3 times a week , remove and add tv channels as they wish.The basement parking looks like a storage room with so many old furnitures , fridge , wash machines , etc.It really doesn't looks like a hotel.If you have a choice go for another hotel as it's not worth for you money because they don't care for your wellness. well this hotel is exellent value for money rooms are clean with fully equiped kitchen.a groccery store is near by along with a fastfood joint.Hotel serve breakfast for extra 45 dirhams internet is not free and its 60 dirham for 24 hours unless its in package.hotel is situated in outskirt quite far from centre of city and other attraction but positive point of this hotel is its next to a metro rail station. I have stayed in Legacy Apartments in November 2008 to January 2010, for 3 months period for business. The apartments generally consists of 1 separate comfortable bedroom, some bedrooms have their own bathrooms in it some of them not. In the apartment there is a big living room and big kitchen separated. Its located on Sheikh Zayed Road, 15 minutes to city center. If you have a transportation like car or free taxi, i strongly recommend the apartments. After i stay there, i have visited dubai in June 2009 and also stayed there with my own expense. The rates are favorable, place is comfortable. Internet is not free but you can find some free networks around the building. I did compare this place with Ibis hotel, in my opinion this is better than other small hotels. PS: Close to mall of the emirates (MOA). I have stayed one month in this hotel and found every thing perfect, staff are very friendly and provided a good care and service, I shall recomend to all my friends to stay when ever they all visit Dubai...Big roomsm good location, near to shopping malls Mehrs I really hope you will read my comment and, after this, to do not book in this terrible place. Only one thing: CONTRACT WITH LEGACY ABOUT THE CONDITIONS CAN BE CHANGED IN EVERY MOMENT, ABOUT EVERYTHING: in 4 months the Legacy staff removed many services. Ad if I wanted to have them back, I had to pay more (housekeeping, internet). The staff is very rude and they treat the people as they are stupid (taxi booking, informations). In 4 months, they left 2 time the door of my apartment completely opened...and another time, they gave my personal mobile phone number to some strange people I did not know. BE VERY VERY CAREFULLY THERE! OPEN YOUR EYES! THEY TRY TO RIP OFF THE PEOPLE! I WON'T COME THERE NEVER AGAIN.",,,

The Roosevelt is in an excellent location downtown, near the bus tunnel and walkable to shopping, restaurants, and the Market. They were very flexible about extending the parking hours, which saved us money. Free computer access is in the lobby and business center. The lobby is a pleasant place to rest between shops.

Granted, we are now middle-aged and accommodations that suited us in our youth do not always appeal to us. Hotel Isabel is definitely inexpensive but it is also dark, dreary,and dingy with an unhelpful staff. Our reservation was not available even though I had confirmed it twice. There was no apology or explanation. They put us in a very small room on the top floor, with a shared bathroom and a view of the corrugated roof covering. We often use this type of room but the bathroom at Hotel Isabel was not clean. The bar and restaurant reeked of desperateness. The safe and remote control did not work. We left the next day and found a hotel down the street (even closer to the Zocalo) for $20 more. If money is your prime consideration this hotel is fine but if you can spend a bit more there are lots of better places.","I stayed at the Hotel Isabel for two nights in Feb 12, to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect since the reviews varied widely. I found the hotel to be ok, I had no problems. The positives : Great location (less than 10min walk from the Zocalo), great price (EUR15), large room with balcony & 18' ceilings, room was quiet despite overlooking the street, hot shower that worked, room was very clean, bed was of an unusual size,somewhere between a single & a double,fine for 1 person,tight for two but it was comfortable (it did have a hard mattress but I like that). I dealt with two different young ladies at reception & found both to be pleasant & helpful. The negatives : there was a strong smell from the pipes in the bathroom, not sewage as a previous contributor mentioned, moreso I'd say just a really old piping system showing its age. The problem was solved by closing the bathroom door. The safe in my room was closed on my arrival & this problem was not solved during my stay. I booked the room via email directly with the hotel. However when I arrived I got the impression that they had no record of my booking, but because there were rooms available this was not a problem. I would like to reiterate this is just an impession I got, not a fact. They do have free WiFi but the sevice was intermittent. Overall I was very pleased with my stay, & would stay here again if in Mexico City.Bottom line, for EUR15 per night you get a clean bed & a shower & what more does one expect for that price. I'm in Mexico City twice a year and I always stay at the Isabel! As you can see from the reviews of Tripadvisor, it's not everyone's cup of tea. On the positive side, the hotel is located less than a ten minute walk to the Zocalo. I've always found the neighborhood safe and friendly. The old colonial-style building has a certain charm although a whole lot of TLC would greatly improve its time-worn appearance. Unlike some, I've always found the front desk staff friendly. The cleaning ladies have always been pleasant, leave my room is great shape, and enjoy speaking Spanish with those of us just learning the language. Finally, it's a really cheap sleep if you're on a tight budget or you just don't like spending more for a hotel in Mexico. Now, the negative! As charming as the hotel is, it is in need of some updating. Internet is available in the lobby for a fee; no WiFi. Be sure and ask for a room with a balcony. Many of these are very large, with high ceilings although a bit delapidated. Avenida Isabel is a busy street. Therefore, it does tend to be a little noisy, but that's true of most of central DF. I tend to enjoy having the windows open inspite of the car and truck noise. Unfortunately, we had bed bugs on our last stay. However, in all the times I've stayed there, this was the first time I had to complain about such a condition in my room. Sure, paint and updating could brighten the rooms, but I also enjoy the atmosphere of a place that takes me back in time to an era in Mexico City I didn't experience. My wife is picky about where we stay when we travel in Mexico and Cental America, but she is fine with the Hotel Isabel in spite of it failings. Location and price are two big pluses. I already have my spring reservation at the Isabel and look forward to my week long visit. The antique style tall ceiling rooms and l covered courtyard make this place have charm while in the center of downtown. Good value, about $22 a night for one. Safe for a woman traveling solo. Has emenities like Wi Fi (a bit slow), Room service, room safe, tv, a homey cafe and bar. Seems to be popular with European tourist. The rooms have very old time high ceiling, vintage hotel furnishings, showers. Not beautiful but basic. A little run down but for the price and location who cares. I like the balcony rooms with the old fashion glass doors. The staff is not overly friendly but very professional. Nice Day of the Dead altar in the lobby one visit. One of my worst experiences, really rude front desk staff, a nightmare sleep, leaky bathrooms were enough to run away from there first nite. Clean & quiet and an easy walk to the historical parts of the city. No breakfast included but a good restaurant attached and a fun little bar to meet the locals and try the tequila! This hotel is located just blocks away from the Centro Historico in Mexico City making it an ideal place to stay. The Hotel has a beautiful internal courtyard too. With breakfast included the price was good for the one night. This hotel is very helpfull and clean, the location is great and there is a nice roof terrace were you can hangout in the sun. When we returned on the way back to mexico city we could leave our backpacks here for free in the luggage room during the day, which was very nice. You can pick a room with or with shared bedroom so for every one's budet there is something.Downstairs is a restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner which is nice and close.. There is free wifi also. Its an old hotel but our stayment was very pleasant, the staff was good, the internet is fast, and if you eat at the restaurant its cheapest and very great, at the bar you can drink tequila mmmm.... Very well ÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡ Is the second time that I was hosted at the hotel Isabel and the truth I am happy, They have improved enough, find better service, Wi-Fi in the rooms, very spacious rooms, very friendly staff, very nice outside building because you arrangement recently, have improved! The restaurant and bar with more varieties news and very good prices If you travel to the city of MÃÂ©xico hotel Isabel is very good option My husband and i travel on a low price budget. Granted, we are now middle-aged and accommodations that suited us in our youth do not always appeal to us. Hotel Isabel is definitely inexpensive but it is also dark, dreary,and dingy with an unhelpful staff. Our reservation was not available even though I had confirmed it twice. There was no apology or explanation. They put us in a very small room on the top floor, with a shared bathroom and a view of the corrugated roof covering. We often use this type of room but the bathroom at Hotel Isabel was not clean. The bar and restaurant reeked of desperateness. The safe and remote control did not work. We left the next day and found a hotel down the street (even closer to the Zocalo) for $20 more. If money is your prime consideration this hotel is fine but if you can spend a bit more there are lots of better places.",,,
barbourella,1768864,"We stayed @ VIP hotel which is in a great location within walking distance of buses to Orchard Road. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area so really peaceful. The staff were all very friendly and only to pleased to help. Our room was a really good size and was spotlessly clean with tea coffee facilities and toiletries. we stayed in a club suite which was absolutely beautiful, with all of the amenities that we could need. Infinity pool is amazing and is a must if you stay at this hotel. If you book early enough you can get a club suite for the price you would normally pay for a regular room, definitely worth it. Staff very friendly and helpful. We would definately stay here again.","Stayed there for nine nights and it was one of the worst hotels Iâve been to. Water in the shower was very cold (at least for Western standards), sheets and towels not very well washed and there were leaks on the ceiling. Internet is charged ( 3 Singapore dollars a day) and it stopped working for over a day. Hotel is not very close to the main tourist attractions, though it is about a 15 minute walk to a subway station. We stayed @ VIP hotel which is in a great location within walking distance of buses to Orchard Road. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area so really peaceful. The staff were all very friendly and only to pleased to help. Our room was a really good size and was spotlessly clean with tea coffee facilities and toiletries. We are a family of four (Two adults and two kids) and we stayed in VIP hotel from 07 to 13 Dec 11 in a Deluxe room-II. The location of the hotel is very good. Its located in a very quiet and posh residential area of Singapore. So no sleepless nights due to road traffic noise etc.The Balmoral Plaza is next to this hotel which has restaurants, multi-utility stores like 7-11 and medicine etc. The Newton MRT stn is 7 min by walk with small children and the bus stand is 4 min on the Bukit Timah road. The room was very spacious and generous. They had put an extra bed for our family which made our lives much easy. Air con was decent. Linen was sparkling clean and was changed every day along with towels etc. The carpet in the room was old and needs a change or can be done away with. The bathroom was clean and hygienic. The room had a small fridge, electric kettle with tea bags etc, an LCD TV, iron on demand and telephone. The buffet area is small and cozy. The breakfast is pretty basic but I guess if you are on holiday with a budget, its ok. The pool is next to the buffet area and comes very handy to relax after a tiring day while holidaying. The cabs are easily accessible from the reception. Some cons :- Very cold behaviour of the staff at reception. Limited drinking water (only two litres per day) and tea sachets in the rooms. Just 10-12 channels in the TV provided. No free internet. Suggestions :- Improve the breakfast, may be add some fruits etc. Provide atleast 1 lit of drinking water per individual per day . Provide increased amount of tea sachets. Provide wi-fi internet access free of cost in the rooms. Overall : Highly recommended for a family holiday where one wants to spend more on tourist attractions and less on accomodation. We've been vacationing in Singapore for over a decade, and at last found a great place to stay. Huge rooms (27 sq meters where as downtown the same priced room is only 9 !), a staff you can talk to and who did there jobs with pleasure and utter quietness at night. Situated in a upscale neighborhood on a tiny street with no through traffic, it's like you are in a cocoon of peacefulness and stability. A well established inn (since 1973, with many remodels, and now complete) run by a real innkeeper, Mr.Tan, who has designed his lodgings for his guests to like, not just endure. It feels like the sort of inns who visited in a different time, when people cared if you came back! Yes: you do have to take a cab to get to the ""sights"", but they are cheap and if you are young, the MRT is 10 minutes away by foot. Yes: there are a handful of restaurants ranging from the cheap and good to the fabulous and expensive, all 5 minutes away on foot, and a upscale grocers just down the way. A great pool with built-in jets to ease those aching muscles from walking all over Little India, too. All of this for the least than the cost of the windowless cubicles downtown. AND...no hidden costs or tricky fine print. We will never stay anywhere else but the VIP. VIP was a disappointment as it is not centrally located though around 20 mins from orchard rd. The breakfast served was unappetizing and rationed as if famine prevailed in Singapore. The card key of the room didn't function properly and one night a whole wing of the hotel was suddenly plunged into darkness as there was a short circuit somewhere in that wing. We had to leave the door open and when we inquired at the reception ,the male staff there was very rude . They did not even provide us with a candle or torch and we had to wait in the corridor for a few hours . Did not feel safe in the hotel and will never go back there. Can't pay money to see grumpy and cold faces of a hotel staff . A welcoming smile from the staff is not a financial investment from management . Fortunately stayed only 2 days there. This hotel was OK but nothing exceptional. It was clean but very faded round the edges and needs a revamp. The pool was out of order as it was being rebuilt and as we had booked because it had a pool that was disappointing - a bit of false advertising going on there! The first receptionist we encountered seemed very uninterested in us and more or less just pointed us to the room and let us take care of ourselves. The breakfast was very small and had little variety. We only stayed one night, I think if we had been staying longer in Singapore we would have moved elsewhere.",,,
mbalass,237565,"I travelled to Rome solo and after hours of scouring the web for a decent B&B I went with this hotel after reading the (mostly) positive/decent reviews and looking at the website which made everything look really nice. As soon as I walked in the room, I knew it wasn't going to be a great stay. The worst part was the odor in the room...there was some kind of sewage problem and the bathroom just stank to high heaven. There was a very harsh odor of bleach or whatever they tried to use to mask the sewage odor coming from the bathroom. The beds are reasonably comfortable (two twins in my room) and the TV was OK. No internet in the rooms. The size of the room was good. Hotel staff was nice and helpful. I didn't like the fact that they request you to leave your room key behind when go in and out, which I didn't bother doing. The location was OK only because it is literally steps away from the Termini station...really convenient. But it wasn't all that close to the main attractions in Rome and the neighborhood was a bit sketchy. The best hotspots for travelers seemed to be close to the Trevi Fountain area. Was not worth the money. Not bad at all for a solo traveller on a budget, compared to the B&B I stayed at last time I came to London. I think I paid around $75 per night to stay for two nights. The room I had was small but tidy, with two twin sized beds, and a decent sized flat screen TV. I really wanted a private bathroom, so that is what sold me on this place. The bathroom is quite small and the shower was a little bit hard to fit into, if you are a larger size I can imagine it might be kind of uncomfortable. The hotel staff were pleasant enough. The breakfast was pretty good, and the internet connection wasn't bad. The lighting in the room wasn't good. The location is good, a short walk to Victoria station and tourist attractions. There are some decent restaurants in the area. Again if you are looking for a decent B&B and to save some cash, this is a good choice, especially for a solo traveler. For couples or families...probably not judging by the size of my room. If you are looking for a clean place to simply rest your head at nighttime and don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room, this hotel is a good option. It's reasonably close to the entertainment options in Central Amsterstam, i.e. a 10-15 minute walk to Dam Square and surrounded by lots of shops and restaurants. The biggest pro is definitely the location if you don't mind some healthy walking or biking to get around, which you'd have to do anyway. The customer service is good, the staff were nice and helpful. The free breakfast was much appreciated as well. The condition of the room and the lobby area has room for improvement. When we walked into the rather shabby lobby which doubles as the eating area, there was an unpleasant smell and it was certainly not what we expected the lobby to look like. Our room was located in the building next to the lobby and there is a set of very steep and narrow stairs to climb to get into the building. The room itself was very basic and small, no frills at all, but that was to be expected. Reasonably clean except some mildew in the bathroom. It would have been nice if the TV worked better, it was all scrambled.","Ok, let's get real. For a budget hotel near the centre of Amsterdam, this does exactly what it says on the tin. The owners were very polite, the breakfast was sufficient (cold meats, cheese, rolls, toast, cereal, boiled eggs) and the room was clean. It was everything we expected and great for a base to explore Amsterdam. Everywhere is only a tram ride away and we had no complaints at all. If you're looking for luxury you won't find it here, but it suited us perfectly. Hotel is very nice, good location, but the blocked on my card money (hotel's guarantee) is not unlocked yet (20 days gone) ItÃÂ´s a little run-down, seeing as this hotel is almost packed solid nonstop. ItÃÂ´s cheap and itÃÂ´s in the city centre. What more do you want in Amsterdam, youÃÂ´re not spending a lot of time in your hotel room. If you plan to, choose a different hotel, spend the extra 30 bucks. I had a single with shared bathroom-shower. At least I had my own sink. The room was cleanish but it was really worn down. It did have a wall-mounted flat-screen tv though, 12inch. The toilet didnÃÂ´t flush well but thatÃÂ´s common in old houses in Amsterdam. Also, the walls are a bit flimsy, I could tell the couple next door was probably having some weird argument as she kept agreeing with him louder and louder ;) Breakfast was minimal but decent. Assorted condiments and some cheese/ham/salami. I would stay again. ItÃÂ´s cheap by Amsterdam standards and itÃÂ´s located near the Amstel rivier, just outside the Prinsengracht, so it has a pretty decent location. DonÃÂ´t stay there if youÃÂ´re expecting to have a top-notch hotel. Basic hotel for budget travellers in Amsterdam but excellent choice. Very clean, we had a double with private facilities for 4 nights, they changed the towels 3 times whilst we were there. Breakfast was a good choice although a bit busy at peak times! The hotel is in a fantastic area, very chic neighbourhood with lovely shops, coffee houses (not shops!), restaurants etc. Only about 10-15 minutes walk into the centre of Amsterdam. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.

It would have been nice if the TV worked better, it was all scrambled. My wife and I chose Hotel de Munck because it was the only place in the city that had a room for us, and so we were slightly concerned about what we would get. Fortunately, it turned out to be an amazingly sweet, decent little place for the low rate. Service was friendly and cleanliness was excellent. The included breakfast was humble and basic but perfectly good. Free wifi was thankfully there and very handy (but not advertised on the website). It is directly across the street from a small park, one of the only parks in the city. An excellent coffee shop (Two For Joy) next door, and a grocery store in the same block are great conveniences. The location within the city overall is great: still in central Amsterdam, just far enough from the centre to be a bit quieter, especially at night, but still extremely close to major attractions. When we saw other hotels weÃ¢â¬â¢d tried to book, we thought, Ã¢â¬ÅPhew, glad we didnÃ¢â¬â¢t end up there: too urban and noisy!Ã¢â¬ï¿½ We had some minor quibbles, but all things that are just part of staying in a cheaper hotel in the heart of Amsterdam: for instance, noise from guests coming and going on creaky and noisy old doors was a bit hard to sleep through at times. And the park across the street feels just a little dodgy for a timid tourist after dark, with some local youth often hanging out and talking noisily, particularly favouring a small area directly in front of the hotel: a minor concern, but a bit unfortunate. And the free wifi, although it was great to have anything at all, was quite unreliable in the rooms: too far from a single router in the lobby, I think.",,,
zaloupa,1960341,"nice location, tram, metro, bus station, bus stasion for the airport, very close to taksim square. the rooms are simple but good enough, the breakfast is poor, the swiming pool is in another building(xaxaxaxa) ,the double beds in some rooms are small (<2.00m) and the most of the staff spoke english!!!! if you stay in the upper floors you will also have a great view of the city! dont imagine a 4 star hotel but for the right offer and price i would suggest it! we paid 70euro for 2 person/day the area is very good, 5 min from vatican city and 15min by foot for the centre of the town.. also you have near to you bus station and metro!!! the employees were very polite and helpfull and all of them spoke english. the breakfast was a little poor and had few things to eat.. the rooms were renovationed and very beautifull, nice bed, good tv, big enough for a couple.. the bathroom was great, everything new in it and in good size. if it wasnt the renovation we wouldnt talk about it now, but it worth the money!!! (i had an offer for the period i went about at 70 euro per day!!!)","Overall this hotel was great value for our discounted rate. We were happy that our 6 yr old daughter could share a double room at no extra cost. The rooms although not spacious had a big bed and were well laid out. The bathroom was good too. My only comment is that the bathroom fittings were a bit broken (shower door and shower hed and hair drier) but I did not ask for them to be fixed as it wasn't really a problem. Very friendly woman looking after the breakfast room! Superb location We went for this Hotel due to an offer they had for our dates & the fact that it was opened only a year ago. Rooms were clean and comfortable, Staff were helpful & courteous, Breakfast was adequate & wireless was free. If you are looking for a large room with a view...this is not a hotel for you, however if you are looking for a centrally located Hotel, that is close to the Metro, Shopping center & Vatican The Excel fits the bill. My wife and I have just returned from a three night stay at the 3 star Hotel Excel Rome San Pietro. The hotel is located about one block from Piazza Risorgimento and under 10 minutes from St.Peters Square. Wonderful hotel, excellent staff, bright modern spotless rooms and a fantastic breakfast. The location is perfect for a 3 or 4 night break. We would thoroughly recommend it! the area is very good, 5 min from vatican city and 15min by foot for the centre of the town.. also you have near to you bus station and metro!!! the employees were very polite and helpfull and all of them spoke english. the breakfast was a little poor and had few things to eat.. the rooms were renovationed and very beautifull, nice bed, good tv, big enough for a couple.. the bathroom was great, everything new in it and in good size. if it wasnt the renovation we wouldnt talk about it now, but it worth the money!!! (i had an offer for the period i went about at 70 euro per day!!!) Really nice litle hotel, with great location (300m.to metro, 600m. to Basilica di San Pietro). It is located within an apartment building. Just like everyone else has said, don't judge the hotel by the appearance of the outside building. It's quite pleasant and modern on the inside.Very helpful,friendly staff. The room was very clean and comfortable, with an electric kettle and cups for making tea or coffee.We didn't have any view from our room (109) but it was very quiet.. WiFi Is free and we had a good connection in our room. The breakfast was very good (without hot meals, but we didn`t need). Just, I think, a little bit overpriced... But it is Rome! We arrived at Excel St Peter's after a series of mistakes by another hotel nearby. Our trip to Italy was centered around a week in Tuscany. To end our trip, we planned three nights in Rome, and for those nights we reserved rooms at the Fabio Massimo Hotel. When by chance we checked email in Tuscany we found a message from Fabio that they had cancelled our reservations in error, and they offered to find us rooms at a similar hotel (the Excel). Here they made another error, for we got to Excel St Peter's only to learn that our reservations there were for one night only. The man on duty very calmly got to the heart of the problem, and invited us to enjoy orange juice and pastries while he arranged for yet another hotel for two nights, until they had a room available., So it was only our final night in Rome that we actually stated at the Excel. We were most appreciative of their professionalism and courtesy. And - the breakfast is wondeful. We loved, in Tuscany, strolling down to the piazza for cappacino and pastry each morning, but we eventually missed the healthier breakfast we are used to, so to find at the Excel St Peters fresh fruit and yogurt and granola-type cereal (in additon, of course, to the usual deadly delicious Italian treats) was a real treat. Hotel is very near metro and Vaticano. Rooms are very new, hotel workers are very good. Breakfast is enough. Very clean, modern hotel in a quiet location just around the corner from St PeterÂ´s Square and the Vatican Museum. The entry to the hotel is ""unusual"" - you go through an old gate into a grubby lobby of some residential apartments that are located on the upper floors. The entry to the ""Excel"" is on the ground floor and once through their door itÂ´s clean, modern and with a friendly welcome. All the staff were lovely - I think i counted 4 different receptionists on duty at different times and also 2 girls who service the breakfast bar and various people working on housekeeping - all very pleasant and efficient at their jobs. The room we were in ""123"" was spacious (even for the 3 of us) with modern fixtures - No view (other than the sky) through the windows/skylights but we were out and about during the day and sleepy at night so this was not a problem. The only thing missing (in my opinion) was tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms. I liked the breakfast and also appreciated the fact that it was available until 1030am - the red orange juice was delicious and the pastries always fresh and the other buffet items were constantly replaced by the busy waitress who also brings hot drinks to your table. All the rooms are located on the 1st floor and thereÂ´s a glass floor when you come out of the lift which gave my vertigo a run for itÂ´s money ! I would return again tomorrow !",,,
Osakasenba,80615,"Reception staff was nice. Room big, albeit a bit shabby. Bathroom OK, but not very clean. 11th floor was quiet. WiFi chargable, about 12 USD. If you wanna see other hotels and casinos, this one is too far away. Surrounding area was not nice. It felt deserted, with a couple of suspicious types hanging around.

Check-in staff was not very friendly and gave completely different story about airport shuttle than truth turned out to be in the morning; were told that they had a minivan and even talked to the driver (?) but in the morning it was the blue airport shuttles that serve the whole area, times and names were all mixed up compared to what we had signed up for, AM staff not helpful is solving the shuttle issue; shuttle has $5 charge/person-had understood it to be free, adds up when you're 14 people!! Didn't bother me and I knew the noise would be there, but if you haven't googled the motel location - it is pretty much at the end of the runway so NOT for light sleepers! and the trolley and railway lines run behind the motel as well. Quiet time is from about midnight or 1- 6:30 am? I personally loved watching the planes come in. For a motel that offers an airport shuttle (or do they?), they should have a public access computer to print boarding passes in my opinion. (A question I forgot to ask when booking.) Apparently we could have given the information to the manager and he would have done that. NOT something I'm comfortable with - I want to be there to do my own check in and baggage payments at the same time. Free Wifi didn't want to work in the 1st room but once we switched rooms, worked perfect.

Motel 6's website stupidly lets you book into the sister property (Downtown) with a child in tow, even though the rooms don't have the ability to put them up. So, we ended up here by default as they do have enough room for couples with children. At first we were alarmed by the reviews before coming here, but actually it's much better than expected and I'm really glad we were forced to move. We had a massive, newly refurbished room with a fridge. It was also cheaper than Downtown and had free Wi-Fi too. Granted, it's next to a strip club, railway line and beneath the flight path of the airport (so close you can almost see the passenger's faces) but we weren't bothered. Never saw any trouble from the strip club (it's far away enough next door and you can't see it from your room) and the planes landing was very exciting. I personally loved being so close to an airport and I'm not even a plane spotter! Most flights have landed by around 10.30-11pm, so noise isn't really an issue from the airport. The departures runway is away from the property, so early morning noise didn't really happen for us. You might get train horns sounding if you're unlucky until about 1am, but that's about it. We didn't use public transport and drove to most places. In particular I would recommend a trip to 'Old Town', which is about 5-10 minutes up the road. We ate out here and loved every minute of it - the ambience is incredible. This isn't as bad as other reviews make out we have stayed in far worse places. $71 for one person on a Saturday night, Outdated but clean. Ignore the snobs reviews. I would rate this on the lower end of the Motel 6 motels I have stayed at. Walk to the bay, shops, downtown. Feels pretty safe here. is what you get. Just be prepared for planes, they come down so close it looks like they are going to land on the roof. Yes, this Motel 6 is located right next to a strip club and on the landing path for jumbo jets. I have never seen anything like this. The jets came so close to the motel that there were people in the parking lot taking photos of the jets as they descended over the motel approaching the airport. Whoever said you could hardly hear the noise once you closed your door must be deaf. There is no way to drown out the sound of a Southwest Airlines or American Airlines flight that is so close to your room you can see the pilot in the cockpit. The place is shabby, just plain shabby. Evevrything is old and dirty and there are no amenities whatsoever. I wrote the corporate headquarters and they informed me that every property is independently owned so basically no one wants to take any responsibility. Furthermore they said I should have known planes would be flying overhead since it is advertised as an airport location. There are much better places to staty in San Diego that are close to the airport but not right on the landing path. On a subsequent stay we used Good Nite inn and although that location was also next to a strip club (seems like popular entertainment in San Diego) the hotel was clean, safe, comfortable and the staff was knowledgable and accomodating. I have stayed at a Motel 6 before in a different part of the country. I understand that they are a no-frills value brand, but what I recalled of my (admittedly long ago) prior experience was that the room was clean and comfortable. Not so here. I arrived around 11 pm and the office was locked. I had to use a ""teller window"" to check-in. This did not inspire confidence in the safety of the motel. Walking in the room, my overall impression was that it was ""icky."" The carpets didn't look clean. The room did not smell particularly fresh. There was no alarm clock. The bedspread was old and had a burn hole on the underside. The pillows were obviously lumpy and uneven under the bedspread. The sheets and blanket were incredibly thin. I didn't feel like there was enough separation between me and the mattress pad. I didn't know if I would be warm enough under the sheet and blanket and I didn't want to use the bedspread unless absolutely necessary. I wasn't confident it was totally clean. The pillows were too big for the pillowcases they were stuffed into. One was too thick for me to rest my head onto comfortably, and both were very lumpy. The mattress was uncomfortably hard. I wasn't sure I would be able to sleep on it, never mind the planes frequently flying not far overhead and the trollies honking by. The bathroom was OK, but a hair dryer would have been nice, and the water pressure was not very good. Granted, the room was relatively cheap for the at $70 for the night, but I expected it to be clean and comfortable at a minimum. It was neither, and I will not be back. Do you know that this hotel is right beside a strip bar? I wouldn't even use the term ""gentleman's club"" because there is nothing gentlemanly with the men who patronize such an establishment. I looked in horror as we saw the neon sign with the silhouette of a naked lady as we drove in. If only we could get a refund, we would have not stayed that night. For practicality's sake, we stayed and it was just one disaster after another. The carpet was so dirty it turned our socks/feet black! There were disgusting stains on it as well. The sheets were old and thin. The only chair in the room was broken. The pizza was overpriced (we ordered from the same chain in the next hotel we stood in since we jetted out of that place as soon as we could the next morning and found that the prices were cheaper there). For a room as disgusting as this, it was severely overpriced at $75. You could hear planes soar above the hotel as they landed. I was on a summer road trip with my husband and two boys ages one and five so it was an extremely horrible experience to stay in this hotel. Half the time, I was expecting to see something inappropriate especially for my kids whom we kept in the room at all times and we didn't allow them to look out the window. Call me paranoid/judgmental but I felt that this hotel was as filthy as the place beside it and I wonder what kind of ""business"" goes on in the other rooms. Definitely not the hotel you would choose if you're on a family trip and if you care about morality. We had a great stay here. I was pretty apprensive at the beginning but we ended up loving this place. It's a great deal if you want to be near downtown SD. Yes, the planes arriviing at SD airport fly right over the hotel but honestly, if you close your door, you can barely notice the noise. Beds were comfy, shower was great and we even had a mini-fridge in our room. I'm one who feels that paying $100+ for a bed and a shower is ridiculous and am a frequent Motel 6 user and this is one of the better ones that I have stayed it (WAY better than the Hotel Circle location by far!). We came in town to see the Dodgers kick some Padres butt (which they did) and I wasn't looking for a places with room service or valet parking. I'd rather spend my money on fun!! So if you are the type like this, don't be afraid - it's not as bad as some of these other people say. **FREE Wi-FI!!**",,,
Elk555,250920,"Great service. Awesome view. Turkish spa is fantastic. If you want dinner on the top floor of hotel overlooking Rome, you need to reserve at least a few weeks in advance(did not know that at the time!). Cant go wrong. its so close to everything, they have a shuttle to downtown a few times a day. Service was so/so. Receptionist was slow to check us in but room was clean. It was clean, near San Marco's. A bit pricey for what you are getting, but I guess that's how everything is in Venice.","Very clean and comfortable room. In my case, the employees was very helpfull. I spend a wonderfull time on Venice thanks to this people. :) We found this hotel very conveniently placed for San Marco Square. The staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful. The room was clean, beding and towels changed every day. Breakfast was adequate. As it was carnival time Venice was extremely crowded and everything was very expensive. Travel by water bus was more expensive than I had remembered from previous visits but it may be that the 'travel cards' were not well advertised during Carnival and each trip was paid for separately. We did buy two return tickets to Lido. Having scanned them on the way over they would not work on the way back. We ended up having to buy two more single tickets - a very expensive 10 minutes on the water at a total of 39 Euros. Service was so/so. Receptionist was slow to check us in but room was clean. It was clean, near San Marco's. A bit pricey for what you are getting, but I guess that's how everything is in Venice. The location was amazing for this hotel. It was right by the San Marco Basilica. The issue is, just about all the hotels in the city are close together and Venice is not that big so in reality-the location just does not justify sleeping in a room that has such an old mattress (it was sagging in the center), with dim lighting, dirty/grungy shower, and rude staff. The staff had absolutely no suggestions and were super rude (the women, not the men-the men were nice). The internet will cost you 25 euros per 24 hours so be prepared if you would like internet. The overall lack of cleanliness is enough to overcompensate for the location. Just stayed here with a group and a booking error was made by staff. They refused to take resonsibilty and tried to blame me also wanted to wake up the guest at 10:30 PM and have her change rooms. They are very argumentative. The rooms are tiny and don't look at all like the website. The location and breakfast is good though. Top location. Near San Marco square. Small hotel but with good service. Helpfull staff. Clean but small rooms. Breakfast is ok. The location is the best for this hotel. Near every sight. Just off St. Mark's square - easy to find. Friendly staff very helpful and offered us too a free boat trip to Murano. Great recommendations on local restaurants. Rooms really nice in the Venetian style and extremely clean. Nice Bathrooms with shampoo, shower gel, caps, soap. Breakfast was much better than we expected. Fresh juice, nice coffee and tea selection, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, croissants, donuts, bread rolls,ham, salami, cheese, omellete and crispy bacon. Would highly recommend. It worked out at ÃÂ£85 for double room including breakfast for 2 guests. Very near to the Hard Rock Cafe too. If you like hard matresses for your back - this is the place to stay. It's located very near to San Marco, very helpful for your site searching and it's not far from the water-bus stop. The rooms are very clean...and that's all. Our room was probably in an ""attic"". The (tiny) elevator is not available in all floors, so we had to take the stairs too. The room was overpriced (ok, everything in Venice is) with no view at all, but what was worse is the size of the room. We had to do most things sitting on the bed because there's no room for anything else than the bed! Thank God Venice is wonderful, so we weren't that annoyed. A great location, just off St Mark's Square and we assume that's how it gets it's four star status. The room was very small (often a problem in Italy; the sort where you bruise your shins as you try and navigate around the bed) and the bathroom miniscule. Plus point was the room and linen appeared to be very clean. No tea/coffee facilities and when asking at the bar for a late night cuppa; the request was met with disdain and begrudgingly fulfilled. Breakfast is very basic. Your usual buffet fare. We were also travelling with friends, they stayed in another hotel The Concorida and loved it. Our other guests were staying in a Venetian guest house two streets back from St Mark's and rated it very highly if all you're after is a good, clean room for the night with breakfast. Wouldn't recommend the hotel for price... The front desk staff at the Royal San Marco is top notch. We arrived at 8 am, expecting to drop off our bags and begin the long wait until check in time exploring the area. Instead, because a member of our group was feeling ill, we were given a single room to occupy until our triple was ready. We rested in this room free of charge until our room was ready at around 11. The triple room was much larger and nicer, but the one major difference was the air conditioning. In the single room where we waited, the A/C was freezing cold and very powerful, but in the triple we booked for the rest of our trip the A/C was clearly broken. It didnÃ¢â¬â¢t get cold at all, never mind it getting as cold as it had in the single room. We called the front desk and were told it would be fixed the next day. This did not happen and again we called the next night and were told the same thing. We asked for another room and were told none were available. We were there for only three nights, and during those three nights the A/C never worked. We slept with the windows open, but it was still brutally hot and sticky, especially after taking a shower. This major failure by the maintenance team was really a shame, and somewhat of a shock, considering we broke a shelf in the bathroom and it was fixed while we were out to lunch without us having notified anyone of it having been broken. The efficient fix of the shelf led me to believe the A/C unit needed some serious repair, in which case we should have been moved to another room. This air conditioning issue is a shame because our stay would have been spectacular if it had been slightly cooler, and I know that this hotel is capable of such because we experienced it in the first room! I would have given it nearly perfect raitings if they had fixed the A/C!!! My husband and I booked a standard room with queen bed and were very surprised when we were taken to what can only be described as an attic. After getting off the elevator on the 4th floor, we had to walk up two flights of stairs. Our room was the size of a closet and had two single beds. There was mold on the ceiling and the shower temperature ranged between scalding hot and freezing cold. After asking for a change of room, we moved to the second floor, which had a double bed (well, two singles pushed together, actually). The room was not any bigger and this shower only did cold water. Breakfast buffet was edible, but below the quality of most other hotels we stayed at. Hotel staff weren't exceptionally friendly. Location is good - it is very close to San Marco Square. My partner and i stayed there for 3 nights, they claimed to be a 4**** hotel. Price isn''t cheap, location is great, staff language barrier really need to be improved. We were given a very small room, basic utilities were provided, very clean, breakfast is not much to choose from and be sure to be there before 10AM, or else nothing's left!",,,
Sherry L,150417,"Tripadvisor has the wrong name posted. This is Hotel El Guajataca. Parador El Guajataca is across the road and not on the ocean. We stayed two nights. There is good handicap accessibility. Every room has a balcony and a view of the ocean. We were on the second floor and the view was gorgeous. Loved sitting on the balcony; loved going to sleep at night listening to the waves break on the shore. Two nice pools. Grounds very well kept. Our only complaint: The floors are brown tile and so do not show dirt. The maid obviously had only been broom-cleaning the floors. They looked clean, but when you walked on them you realized that they were grimey. I had to get her to come in and mop them. It was $98 a night and we were traveling on a budget, so we were willing to put up with that. The room had a king-size bed and ample space. Amenities are minimal. There are 7 steps up to the second floor and 7 steps down to the first floor. The hotel is hard to spot from the road; signage is poor. Going west, take the first right after you pass Merendero Recreation Area. If you see the sign for Tunel de Guajataca, you've gone too far. The plain front belies the beautiful view in the back. All ocean and lush, green, undeveloped hillsides in the back. Yes, we would go back. Everything about this resort is amazing....rooms, view, the staff. If I ever come to Hawaii again I won't leave the resort, Felt ripped off everywhere but here. My family had the best vacation at Grand Seas this week. The resort staff very friendly and this truly is a family resort . We have already made a reservation for our next vacation. My family loved it so much we just purchased a two bedroom with the resort. This truly was a great experience for my children!!!!!!","Tripadvisor has the wrong name posted.

Staff were very friendly at check in. Wifi only works in lobby which is comfy and well decorated.Free breakfast is basic with coffee, juice and toast. Very friendly staff throughout. Would stay here again. First, this is no longer a ""parador"" (a government-run small inn). It is now a private hotel. In 2002, during our first stay, it had a decent, free breakfast, a mini-'frig in room, even a free drink when you checked in. All this is gone. Although the room itself was clean (though musty), garbage littered the grounds below the windows. The window was rusted shut. There was no hot water in the shower. Two pieces of cold toast and bad coffee (where is the legendary Puerto Rican blend?) was $2.19. At 8 AM the restaurant was closed so we ate at the bar. ""Why is the restaurant closed?"" we asked. The surly clerk shrugged. ""The cook's still sleeping."" A stray dog and cat roamed the indoor common areas, the dog begging for food, which some guests threw from their balconies. I've lived in Puerto Rico for six years. Do yourself a favor. Stay in San Juan. Or, better yet, vacation in the Dominican Republic. It's right next door to P.R., cheaper, and has better service. i stayed last year the staff is nice but one of the staff is really good and knows the vaul of a custmor she goes out of her way to help the guest she goes that extra mile god bless her her name rosa.the rooms are nice and clean the view is great.i will be back next year. My family and I lived in Arecibo, Puerto Rico for about 1 1/2years and returned to visit the Island and show our kids. We stayed at El Guajataca for 2 nights and we loved the pool and beach so much! But the best part was in the morning when we sat down for breakfast and the window right by our table was open and the ocean breezes felt so relaxing and refreshing. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world, all my family was with me and the view of the ocean and sound of the waves is a memory that always is there when I think of Puerto Rico. my name is shey roman and i have been travelling to this hotel for 2o years. i was born in ponce but i stay here because i love it ! i love the staff, the pool the walk to the river and the ocean. i wake up to this beautiful view and it sets my soul free. i can connect with the ocean and be free. so for the haters ....too bad, nothing in life is perfect its how you view it......oh and about the dogs ...its sad but if you give a **F bring them food.",,,
kirsi n,1378963,"Very good value for money. Breakfast very delicious. Room very clean and nice, everything worked!!! OK budget hotel, with spotless clean bathroom! Breakfast basic, but enough. Good connections to city centre and airport.",".It was easy to travel with bus or metro to city. The rooms were nice and tidy. Bathroom just renovated. There were some small shops nearby in order to get some snacks or drinks to rooms. We stayed here for 3 nights and although our room was not very big it was very clean and looked as though it had recently been refurbished. The staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast had a wide choice of continental and hot food. The location was great as the 109 stops right outside. Travel around Berlin was very easy, buy a day ticket and you can use the bus, tram or train as many times as you like. had a wonderful time and would definitely stay there again. Very good value for money. Breakfast very delicious. Room very clean and nice, everything worked!!! I stayed in this hotel for a total of 6 nights. Room was very small but comfortable. The location is very good, you can find the supermarket just opposite to the hotel and you can take the bus from the station near to the hotel. The hotel is about 10-15 minutes walk to the ICC center and the the norde messe train station. you can find a buitiful lake just near the hotel. I would not book this hotel again if I go with family because the rooms is very small but I would certanly book there if I go alone.. We stayed here for 4 nights in Dec 2009 with my mum and her husband. We came for the Xmas markets. The Hotel was lovely, clean and comfortable, reception staff speak english and can give you a map of Berlin. The breakfast was continental but they did have some German bits and bobs that you can eat (sausages, Lamb kofta bites?, Egg, Beans) The Underground is very near the hotel ( go out the door, turn left and then turn left again, to the top of the street is the underground) You can use the underground to see all the sights in Berlin, an all day ticket is 6 Euros but you can get on and off the under ground and over ground train, we used this to get back to the airport! so dont use a taxi there more expensive. The maps for the underground are very easy to use and understand. They dont seem to have any English tea anywhere in Berlin apart from McDonalds! so had a few trips to get mums brews from here, they are pretty much everywhere. The Xmas markets were fantastic! they all sell the same things, most of which we didnt want but they still looked fab! (gingerbread hearts, hand carved xmas toys,lampshades, mulled wine etc) The foods stall are excellent, we ate lots of sausages! Bratwursts are lovely! also they have some doghnut balls with iced sugar on them that are just awesome! The markets are very attractive to see and it feels very christmassey when you see them. Eating out can be a tad expensive in restaurants etc. We stuck to the street vendors and Mcdonalds etc. We found a great Itallian place that serves great pasta dishes that are quite cheap. It is situated on the same road as the hotel -Neue Kant StraÃe about 15 mins walk down the street. We went to all the attractions, the Berlin wall & Brandenburg Gate are a must and Alexanderplatz and Potsdamaplatz both have lots to do. There are some great shopping centres here if you want to shop. All in all we had a Magical time here and we would def go back. I was there for IFA, the second largest show for consumer electronics, and wanted a hotel close to the Messe Berlin and also reasonably priced. During trade shows hotels increse their rates almost 4-5 times, making it unaffordable for the common man. I was happy that I got Ivbergs Hotel Charlottenburg. Theres another Ivbergs from the same group - The Ivbergs Berlin Messe, so be careful while booking. The hotel is just 10 minutes or 2 stps from the Messe. The rooms are modern, air-conditioned rooms with free Wi-Fi. Transport connections from airport are good. They have breakfast for an additional Breakfast 9,00 EUR. For Indians theres is a good Indian restaurant within walking distance. This hotel is slightly out of the centre and about a 5-10 minute walk from the station but has buses to Tiergarten directly outside. The breakfast is quite healthy and fresh fruit is available. WiFi is available in the rooms and is quite fast. Reasonable priced restaurants around hotel. Good quality rooms with new appliances and cleaned daily. Stayed at this hotel while waiting for our apartment to be ready and were very impressed. The room was brand new and very tastefully decorated. The hotel also allows pets at a reasonable rate which was very helpful for us since we were in the middle of our move to Berlin and needed a place that allowed pets that was actually nice. Highly recommended! Just back from a five night stay at the Ivbergs Charlottenberg Hotel. We found the hotel lovely and clean with friendly staff. The breakfast was very substantial and consisted of hot and cold dishes, bread, rolls, fruit etc. The area in which the hotel is situated is quite upmarket and we never felt threatened in any way during our visit to Berlin. Although you are a wee bit away from the main sights, public transport is excellent. However, we walked to the Brandenburg Gate, which took about an hour and thereafter into the centre of the city. There is a lovely restaurant across the road from the hotel called the Pula Grill and this is very reasonable and the food very good. Free salad and apperitif. Just back from a short break to Berlin. 3 nights at the Ivbergs. Warm, comfortable and generously sized room with good ensuite. Good selection at buffet breakfast. Handy for public transport to main areas of Berlin. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Should the weather be as cold and the pavements as treacherous, recommend the Pula Grill opposite the hotel for evening meals. Good range of food from fish, chicken to meats. The steaks are particularly tasty and all at a reasonable cost. Liked the aperitif and the salad presented free as part of the meal.",,,

Rode our harleys from Green Valley Arizona to San Diego got in late and was greeted well. The motel is very clean and centrally located good parking and safe for te bikes. I can't say enough good things to say I will be back and will encourage all my friends to stay We have stayed here 2 times . The manager Ray was very helpful for us because we booked on Expedia and it was the wrong room that we desired, but Ray gave us the correct room at the same price. Very nice! The 2 room suite was very adequate and had all the amenities that you find in the high end hotels that can get very expensive in San Diego. It has a great location on the main street and within walking distance to stores, restaurants and the beautiful marina. It is freeway close to all of San Diego's main attractions. I have just booked two more nights for next week. A budget traveler's delight. Here's a tip. Don't book Point Loma Inn and Suites through a booking agent but call direct for the best price. They are very accommodating. This is a cute little hotel that has a wonderful staff and it located in the middle of everything...only a 5-10 minute drive to anywhere you would want to go in San Diego. The down side of that is it is off of a busy road and the rooms are not the most quiet. Nothing ear plugs can't solve though. The rooms are small, but they were clean. Folks this isn't a Hyatt or a Hilton, but if your looking for a cheap place to stay so you can spend your money elsewhere this is a great place. Ray the manager was always accomodating and there are microwaves and fridges in the rooms which is nice if your staying for a long period of time. We would definately stay here again! Pt. Loma Inns is located near all SD events and tourist destinations. It is close to town and freeways. Great restaurants and shelter island bay views are easy walking distances. The rooms were very clean and the management friendly and helpfull. I would highly recommend this thrifty hotel to all visiting San Diego. Upgraded to a bigger room with kitchenette by Ray the manager. Well-appointed if modest furnishing and very clean. The Wi-fi worked flawlessly and there were enough kitchen supplies to cook with. Maybe we were lucky but other guests were quiet and only noise came from cars on busy Rosecrans. Parking is very tight but Ray works it so most can fit in lot. Location is great, only one block from harbor and one block from road to airport. Price is hard to beat for San Diego. We stayed in this hotel for one night as part of a 3 week road trip across the US. It was certainly not the cheapest place we'd stayed in overall, but it was pretty cheap by San Diego standards. It was very well located and an easy walk to Humphries and lots of interesting restaurants along the harbour area. The funishings inside were a little tired, but we never plan on spending much time in a hotel room, so it didn't matter to us. This hotel was also amongst the lowest price we found in the area, so we didn't expect a palace. Unfortunately, our night was completely ruined by some irresponsible louts who returned to their room at about 1am and proceeded to shout and scream outside in the car park at the top of their voices until about 4am. We've stayed in motel style places before, and have been disturbed many times in the past but this noise was like nothing on earth. On three seperate occassions we tried to call the front desk to complain, but the phone line was permanently engaged (had they taken the phone off the hook?) In the morning, we complained at the front desk, and they were apologetic, but it was all too little too late. They explained that they had also heard the shouting and screaming from the other guests, but had assumed it was from another hotel... Although hotels cannot be held responsible for the social skills of their customers, I do not feel they took adequate steps to resolve the issue. For this reason only, I would be very reluctant to return to this hotel. PLI was our base during our three weeks summer holiday stay in SD and surroundings. Very friendly, helpful and serviceminded manager! He did all the best for us, always with an honest smile! Our group of 9 (four adults, three teenagers, two under 10) shared two rooms. Not much space, main bed very good, the other one (sofa bed) a little soft for the kids sharing it - they ended up in a heap in the middle but no serious complaints from the tired ones. Bathroom and kitchen ok, same with the cleaning. All in all, we got what we payed for. The only thing we really missed was a couple of extra chairs round the balcony table in the evenings when socialising. Keep up the good work! With kind regards Geirmund and the rest at #14. ""Point Loma Inn @ Suites"" The Best place to stay - wonderful! for the price, location, room and service! This motel is very small -over a dozen rooms, surrounded by many other motels we went first, where we stumbled on some problems like: at the ""Dolphin"" motel for 5 people they had to offer 2 rooms, because one room holds up to 3 persons. At ""Comfort Inn"" up to 4 persons and ""Sun Harbor"" is very cheap, not only by price but by the look and feel as well. They got tiny rooms and dirty carpet, hair on the pillow case, just nasty!! ""Ramada"" was nice but almost $80 more for 3 nights then at ""Point Loma"". We got a discount for 3 nights, plus remember the weekend is always more $$ but we got a flat rate for all 3 days (on 4th of July weekend!). AAA discount included. They also have breakfast: cereal, muffins, milk, coffee and fresh orange juice. Very Friendly and pleasant management. Our room was shown before checking in. For Two adults and three young kids it is perfect accommodation! Main room for parents with a queen bed, fridge, TV, microwave, coffee maker iron and ironing board, dresser, nice table and 2 chairs - lot's of room and the other bedroom with two single beds, beautiful bedding and 2nd TV. Room is super clean, feels more like hotel, nice decor and bedding. Our bathroom was nice as well with a dryer and fresh towels, shampoo and soap. We didn't bring our laptop other ways we'll use their Free wireless internet. Location of the motel is amazing! in just a minute walk away from beautiful San Diego Bay with boats and yachts. Point Loma SportFishing, restaurants. Very short drive (5 minutes) to Sea World, old San Diego and Down town, Coronado isled, beach and museums like ""Maritime"", ""USS Midway"". It is also right by the airport. Very close to the ocean and many more things... We loved the stay there and will come there again! Would be nice to have different breakfast each morning. And one thing for the room: it needs bigger trash cans. That's about it! I had a peaceful and wonderful stay in the Point Loma Inn and Suit. I was taking a course at Maritime Institue in sd and needed that type of hospitality. Not only where they peaceful, their prices where WAY LESS than the other motels around. There location was only a block from the school and was really easy for me to consintrate and focus on my studies. Rooms where big enough to do all my assignments and had great space for my charting. I was there for two weeks, mangement and staff made me feel like i was at home. Nevertheless I passed my exams! I recommend this hotel to the future students who will intend Maritime Institute in SD. Sincerly yours Captain Jazen Wakeman Great place to kick back, i have been coming here on and off for about three months and every stay is pleasurable. the front desk(ray) isnt hard to approach and is a gentlemen and took care of my needs. right next to the water, good location for food. Will definatly be here again shortly.",,,
ridethestallion,234943,"The Hotel Ravenna needs a facelift and a makeover. The rooms are cramped. The furniture and decor deserve ""relic"" status. The hotel offers a passable breakfast, which is a nice start to the day. But, like the hotel itself, breakfast consists of basic fare offered with a half smile. Most of the staff seem perplexed if not downright diffident toward basic requests. Wireless access requires the purchase of Internet credit cards available (sometimes) at the front desk. Unfortuntely, the front desk ran out of the 5 EUR cards (smallest denomination available) repeatedly thoughout our two-week stay. For the money, you can do better. Berlin offers a slew of low-budget but high-quality hotels in far more inviting locations. The hotel is located a few blocks from the Rathaus Steglitz U-Bahn stop, which is a plus. However, if you choose to drink or dine in the area, visit the General Post Office pub, a fine establishment to the right and a couple of blocks northeast of the hotel. Motel One Berlin Mitte offers travelers clean rooms and reliable accommodations. From the bed to the bath, the rooms are tiny. Really tiny. But the hotel is well located near a fine selection of pubs and restaurants. The wireless is reliable. The hotel bar serves good drinks and reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet is generous with good hours. Besides reliability, the another nice feature of Motel One Berlin Mitte is the hotel's proximity to the Moritzplatz subway station, which provides easy access to much of Berlin. The Hilton Chicago offers visitors an excellent location on Michigan Avenue, in downtown Chicago. The location of the hotel puts visitors within easy walking distance of various museums, great restaurants, and shopping. I've stayed here many times. My consistent impression is that the Hilton Chicago is a big hotel. It's really big. But the service level of the staff make the Hilton Chicago seem like a boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and highly attentive. Ditto for the restaurant and bar staff. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Yes, it's an older hotel. It's an old fashioned decor throughout the property. However, to escape the weather of Chicago (summer or winter) and enjoy excellent views of Lake Michigan or downtown, this hotel offers travelers an excellent choice. Given the physical size of the hotel and the number of people staying here on a busy night, there can be a considerable wait for elevators. Unless you are running late for an engagement, a long wait for the elevators is a minor inconvenience considering the positive aspects of this property. One word of caution if you choose to use the ""L"" (public transport elevated train) to transfer from O'Hare to the hotel (use the ""Blue"" train line), the closest ""Blue"" stop is ""Jackson."" Despite the appearance of proximity to the hotel, getting off at Jackson with more than one bag does not make for easy walking distance to the hotel. The Eliot Hotel is a luxury boutique hotel. No doubt about it. But something is missing in the service department. The physical structure of the place is warm and inviting. My first reaction to seeing our room was that heaven must have had a sale on fabrics. From the linens to the drapes to the towels, there are plush fabrics everywhere. As result, the hotel is warm and comfortable and rather quiet given its location. And, for a hotel stay in the dead of a Boston winter, there probably is not a warmer or warmer feeling hotel in town. However, the warmth ends with the structure of the hotel. The front desk service is tops. However, the bar staff, cleaning crews, and restaurant staff just seem mildly indifferent. It's as though the hotel has ""done enough"" to compete as a luxury hotel and the staff lacks the incentive to do more. And for the prices commanded by the Eliot (basic rooms starting at $350-450/night), the hotel should reflect a stronger commitment to serving its customers. * Requests for additional pillows for the room required a couple of calls to the front desk (I offered to go down to the front desk myself but was assured the staff would handle it), and they were delivered an hour later. * When we visited the bar (each evening over a 4-night stay), the bar staff were, well, just tepid. Simply not engaged with us or any other customer that entered the bar. I've worked in the hospitality/food service industry for years. Yes, when staff is busy, no one should expect endless, buoyant conversation. But we did not see the bar staff doing much of anything. Perhaps there is a management issue that translates into a lack of morale with the staff. Just a guess. Yes, the Eliot is a contender for greatness. The look, feel, location, and pricing of the hotel put the Eliot in top tier range. And I am rooting for the Eliot to succeed! It has almost everything it needs to be one of the finest hotels. But the service needs to improve. A good hotel stay is more than bricks, motor, and, in this case, fabric. A worthwhile customer experience in a hotel requires consistent, friendly service. The current lack of good customer service is what makes the Eliot a good, not great, hotel.","The Hotel Ravenna needs a facelift and a makeover. The rooms are cramped. The furniture and decor deserve ""relic"" status. The hotel offers a passable breakfast, which is a nice start to the day. But, like the hotel itself, breakfast consists of basic fare offered with a half smile. Most of the staff seem perplexed if not downright diffident toward basic requests. Wireless access requires the purchase of Internet credit cards available (sometimes) at the front desk. Unfortuntely, the front desk ran out of the 5 EUR cards (smallest denomination available) repeatedly thoughout our two-week stay. For the money, you can do better. Berlin offers a slew of low-budget but high-quality hotels in far more inviting locations. The hotel is located a few blocks from the Rathaus Steglitz U-Bahn stop, which is a plus. However, if you choose to drink or dine in the area, visit the General Post Office pub, a fine establishment to the right and a couple of blocks northeast of the hotel. My colleagues and I stayed at the Hotel Ravenna to attend a business meeting in the local area. For a sub-100 Euro hotel, it was great. Staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms were clean (a little dated furniture wise, but what would you expect for â¬77 in a European capital city) and the buffet breakfast was above average for ""continental"" (Selection of juices/fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurt, fresh boiled or scrambled eggs, selection of meats/cheeses, selection of breads/rolls, etc). The neighbourhood is safe, (leafy green suburb of Berlin), but close to some shopping malls and supermarkets. Rathaus Steglitz U-Bahn station is a 5-10 min walk giving access to two underground train lines into central Berlin. There is an Italian restaurant next door which was relatively cheap and the food was great and there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. 10 minutes walk turning right out of the hotel are the Botanical Gardens (â¬6 entry)...my colleague and I only had an hour to spare before we needed to get back to the airport, but it was fabulous, the tropical plant houses and the tropical plants inside them are huge! I would certainly have no problem staying at the Ravenna again and would have no problem recommending it to friends/family.",,,

We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!! GROSS...... seriously need a hazmat suit to enter. We stayed in downtown hotel Seattle for two night. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms wee very clean. Just minutes away from union street and 5th avenue. Starucks coffee next door. 24 hour room service was extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered pizza to our hotel at 12am. we had a good experience. i made reservations and when i showed up, i quickly started laughing at how pathetic is was. first, they didnt even have parking near the hotel. second, i asked if they had wi-fi and they replied enthusiastically,"" we have it in the lobby!"" how is that even a perk? finally, i said screw this place for these rates and left. the manager offered other places and followed me to the door. the next day, they charged me for the reserved room and said that i was a no show! the people are rude and have not given my money back yet. they should post their business as a motel at the very least! all i can say is never again! OK, it is affordable but the rooms are cramped and uncomfortable, I was put in a room with two twin beds rather than the queen-sized that I ordered. Not a good thing to do to a 6'2"" man. The girl at the desk had trouble answering the most basic of questions about the area and for some odd reason the overnight clerk saw fit to leave the front door open all night. Not a smart thing to do in Seattle in late September. I can't tink of one reason why I'd stay here again. My husband and I decided to stay at Hotel Seattle because of the price and the location. But in the end, it probably would have been cheaper for us to stay at one of the nicer hotels a block over. There's no parking at this hotel, which meant we had to spend 30 bucks at a parking garage. Also, there's no internet in the rooms and our T.V. didn't work. Definitely a BIG disappointment. I am just a college student visiting Seattle, and without looking into greater detail about the hotel I was making reservations with, I got stuck with Hotel Seattle. I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in. No human being deserves to stay in such a mold-infested dump. OH YEAH- pay $10 for wifi for one day. The hotel lived up to the nature of previous reviews. It is superbly located in the middle of Seattle, but is essentially just a place where you can sleep overnight - a bit like an up market hostel really. Not very much wrong with it, but not much right with it either. Main faults were a room door that was coming off its hinges, a torn sheet, no information in the room, a fairly narrow double bed, a burbling radiator, and some slightly dubious looking receptionists behind the desk. On the good side the room was clean, there was nothing wrong with the bathroom, and it was fairly cheap. There's also a breakfast place next door, although again from the outside it looked a bit dubious. I was unfortunately booked into this dump by my corporate travel office, I have filed a human rights complaint. This place was probably a dump 20 years ago, its better days are long gone. DO NOT PAY TO STAY HERE, there are nice hotel in the area for comparable rates. We checked in, saw the room and checked back out. I can't add anymore to the description of the ugly, mold infested, creepy room than what has already been said from other reviewers. But I can tell you that it wasn't easy to find another hotel room on a Saturday afternoon. After calling nearly every hotel downton, we lucked out and wound up paying over $200 for the last room available at the Hampton Inn (which was beautiful). But I still shudder at the memory of my very short stay at the Hotel Seattle.",,,
Carol0143,2514985,"The location of this Quality Inn is good, very close to the mall and restaurants and surrounded by other 2-star hotels. Staffs at the front desk and breakfast area are very nice. The room is spacious. However, the carpet and the walls need remodeling. There are white stains on the carpet, and later the front desk lady told me those could be paint stains from remodeling. I found two things different from the Expedia description. First, the front desk hour ends at midnight, not 24-hour. Second, the breakfast selection is much better than in the picture! This is the second time I stayed at the hotel. For both times, I got a price of $45 at priceline. Bed is very comfortable. Bathroom is large and clean, and the shampoo is OK. We stayed at very south end of the wing, and the noise from airport and from Century Ave can be bothersome. But the AC is even louder, so... Hotel provided us with one pair of eye mask and ear plug. Parking tips: if you come back hotel late and will be leaving before 9 am, you can consider park your car on the street at the back of the hotel. Parking is free 9 pm-9 am, but there is a two-hour limit before midnight. You can save $12 this way.

I was very pleased with my stay except for he hole in the bathroom door (looks like it was kicked), and nasty, nasty hair in the bathtub! The bed was comfortable, wonderful pillows.

I found two things different from the Expedia description. First, the front desk hour ends at midnight, not 24-hour. Second, the breakfast selection is much better than in the picture! We had an emergency trip to the U of I Animal Hospital, and they decided to keep the dog overnight, so we needed a place to stay. I usually go with hotels I am familiar with and comfortable with, as well as the free breakfast! In this case I still wanted the free breakfast, but outside of that I was open. I plugged in my GPS and asked for a list of hotels, scrolled through and found ""Comfort Inn"", which I knew had a free breakfast. When I called, the clerk answered ""Quality Inn"". My GPS has not been uploaded for new info for a long time. I asked ""Do you have something for tonight?"", and he said yes. ""Do you serve free breakfast?"", and he said yes again. So we drove over there. There was very little to complain about. For $80.99 plus tax, we had a double with a box TV and a bath. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked, and the toilet flushed. The room was very clean, and the pool and hot tub, while I didn't use them, were observed to be clean and warm. Breakfast was served from 7:00 to 10:00. They served biscuits and gravy, do-it-yourself waffles, hard boiled eggs, assorted sweetrolls, donuts and English Muffins, dry cereal, juice and coffee. The coffee was great! There was no hot oatmeal, and that was a disappointment, but the serving area was small. The staff seemed friendly and accommodating, and they weren't very busy. In fact I doubt even half of their rooms were taken. The hotel was very quiet, and there was plenty of parking in a small lot on this Friday night. If there was anything to complain about, it was the size of the bathroom. To get to the shower we had to close the door, and closing the door meant a tight squeeze. I was also a little perturbed that the water pressure at the bathroom sink was weak. However design flaws and water saver faucets go back to senior management, not local staff. The carpeting in the dining area was bunched and wrinkled, but staff there said someone had bought the hotel and it was going to be completely rehabbed soon. From my experience, there didn't seem the need to rehab too much. This was the worse experience ever. We arrived and was checked into our room to find it full of crickets (dead & alive). When we unfolded the couch it was full of dead crickets. When i ask for more towels because we had 6 people in our party they made us feel like we were trying to steel the extra towels. The room was dirty not just from the crickets but it had not been swept in weeks. When we checked out the manager was very rude when i explained we were not happy with the dirt and crickets. Will NOT stay there and would NOT recommend staying. This was like luxury for us coming in from a long trip. We immediately on arrival made use of the beautiful indoor pool and spa pool - both very clean and so inviting. The room was great - we had free internet. The bed was incredibly comfortable as were the pillows. We slept through the breakfast which was included so missed out on that and were woken before our checkout time by a housekeeper - and when I said yes, she seemed embarrassed she had disturbed us. I'm not sure why the housekeepers have to do that - surely its easy for them to find out which rooms are checked out and which aren't? Overall very relaxing and would definitely stop there again - if we get to I will look forward to it.",,,
Patrick B,91519,"My wife and I spent 4 days at the resort. Very nice place geared toward adults, but with families there as well. More of a european feel to it. Employees were very helpful. There was a show every night and we were able to try different type meals every night also. We spent one rainy day visiting the other Riu resorts. We enjoyed this one the best. Many daytime actvities on the resort you could do as well, but we most enjoyed just sitting on the beach, 100 yards from our room. If you're looking for R&R, this is a good, affordable place for it! This is my favorite hotel in Boston and Ive been to many. I love the atomosphere, elegent and calm. This is a great spot Thanks to all the staff at Doubletree in Puerto Rico, especially to Daiana, Margarita, Antonio, Peter and Juan for making my every visit a memorable one Cecily Simmonds-Barrett I stay here when on business; good value, clean but dated. Nice pool and hot tub. Wireless connection is unusably slow. Great location Helpful staff Nice room with very clean bathroom Allowed 3 of us to share a suite using the sofabed - ideal and made for a cheap stay","I stay here when on business; good value, clean but dated. Nice pool and hot tub. Wireless connection is unusably slow. We frequently stay at Marriot locations and this one did not disappoint. Conveniently located just north of the freeway on Indiana 31. The rooms have been recently remodeled, staff is friendly and helpful. Very clean rooms and super comfortable beds. On site Bistro is convenient but there are also many nice restaurants close by. This is the second time I have stayed here on a business trip. I am used to hotels that cater to business travel to typically provide a complimentary light breakfast, coffee, and a paper. I paid over six dollars for toast and coffee. Perhaps this is typical of very big cities, as I usually am in somewhat smaller cities. But the price is the same as a smaller city so I expected the same. The lobby computer was painfully slow and I gave up. The hotel and rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is capaple and friendly. They need to put TV channel line up cards in the rooms. The elevators could use some updating, had a little trouble with the button for the 4th floor in the back one, gave up and took the stairs after that. This is a great hotel, I went for one night and I end up staing 2 nights. The staff was friendly, the rooms were very clean and the food was great. Stayed here for Indianapolis Final 4 in 2010. Just minutes from Indianapolis. Carmel, IN is a VERY safe city near many parks, restaurants, and very nice mall (Keystone Crossing.) This Marriott is in a business district. The hotel: very quiet, clean, comfortable, elegant, and kid friendly. Indoor pool / hot tub are fabulous and clean. Pool is heated. The hotel was VERY quiet, and Final 4 weekend was a great test of that. Definitely kid friendly. Completely non-smoking, no pets allowed, which are my first pre-requisites for ANY hotel when traveling with kids. Free internet and has a business center. Also has a rental car company inside!! Wow! Room: stayed in a 1 bedroom King suite, with a door separating the bedroom from the living area. Parents traveling with kids: this room is awesome for kids!!! The kids sleep in their own bedroom and you can talk/watch TV or whatever, without disrupting their sleep, keeping the peace for everyone, including neighbors. I do not know about other parents traveling with kids, but I dislike tiptoeing around worried about waking my kids up. In this room, you just close the door to their room and they feel like they are at home! The living room came with a comfortable pull-out sofa bed. The room had a refrigerator, microwave, new granite counters, and new cherry furniture. There was a nice desk with pull-out table for dining, and a beautiful leather office chair. There were 2 additional cushioned chairs and a full size sofa sleeper. Two televisions were safely anchored to the dressers/cabinets. The bedroom had an updated radio with iPod dock and a lounging couch. Carpet in the entire room was new and clean. There was a nice balcony with sliding glass door to fresh air. The bedroom and living room each had their own thermostat control. Your kids can have the room temperature they way they want it, and people in the living area can have their own temperature preference. Housekeeping: very thorough and detailed. They cater to your every whim. Bathroom: small, basic, with a full bath/shower, VERY clean, nice tile. The vanity area was VERY clean, carpeted, and was beautiful granite. The staff: very friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. Parking was ample. The manager and other staff are easy to deal with, should you have special requests, and will do everything they can to appease you. Free WiFi. In-room coffee. Clean pool and hot tub. Friendly front desk. My only problem were teenagers, as my room was near the pool/hot tub. Don't get a room there if you need to sleep. Complaints to management didn't help; they were loud and noisy well after 11pm. That said, the front desk people were first rate otherwise. There is the problem of the insanely priced breakfast there. Go down the street to 96th, where you can find much better deals at fast food or sit-down bakery cafes or coffee shops. The staff at this Marriott property are very nice (Matthew at front desk was excellent), but the hotel's rooms and areas need more work. We arrived and were immediately trapped in an elevator. Staff gave us the impression it was not a rare occurence. The room's bathroom had numerous water problems. Faucet leaked and drain would not open and close easily. Finally, the hotel picks up traffic noise from Meridian Street and I-465. It didn't overwhelm me, but wasn't a disaster, etiher.",,,

I read alot of great reviews of Hotel Le Six, and even they understated this great place. The staff was excellent and very accomodating. The rooms were great, but if you get a room next to the street, be prepared for some street noise (which we found charming). The location is just great, and within walking distance of both bikes that you can rent (highly recommended) or the train station. Independent of transportation, you literally can walk any place in Paris from this Hotel, if you like to walk. Great value for the money. The only drawback would be the lack of a ""real gym"". We loved the place and will go back. The rooms were nice and at a good price for the location. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was overpriced by about 30%. Internet service was $9.99 per night in the room, most hotels from Motel 6 on up now have free internet services in the rooms. We've stayed in lots of Super 8s, so we weren't expecting the Ritz or anything, but quite honestly they're usually a decent room at a great price. Not this time. The room was dirty (there was ""stuff"" embedded in the walls in the bathroom, and I'm just not gonna speculate on what it was), and the walls must have been less than an inch thin. We could hear every ""conversation"" the loud guy next door had with his bratty kids, and every morning it sounded like the maids were working with heavy equipment right outside our door. Nothing like 2-3 hours of off-and-on sleep to start each vacation day off right! I still think Super 8s can be a good deal - but steer clear of this one.

It does not get any better than this. I am on record as their first client fromOntario when this hotel facility first opened. It was and still is my favorite downtown Vancouver hotel. All rooms are modern and suite oriented. The views from any room are great, however, Vancouver's high rise developments are starting to block some of the waterfront vistas and Grouse Mountain. The hotel has excellent dining options, with varied menus, tasty food, unbelievably good service and the prices are very good. The ambience throughout this ""club property"" is quietly sedate but with much happening. I have stayed at this hotel several days over the past three months. I have come to really like the hotel, its convenient downtown location and its well thought-out rooms. All the rooms have been revovated; equipped with wireless; and have beds as comfortable as the best hotels. Desk areas are compact but very appropriate. All staff are very accomodating and effective at their jobs. Client satisfaction is important to each employee. Only two areas that could use future improvements are the infiltration of downtown noise from traffic and the need to replace the elevator with a faster, smoother, higher tech model. My wife and I found the Hotel Pulitzer to be excellent in all respects. What especially impressed us was the professionalism and friendliness of the front desk staff. They made excellent recommendations with respect to both visiting Amsterdam's many art museums and eating at local dining restaurants. We were also touched by how the staff at breakfast greeted an older couple who had clearly stayed at the Pulitzer many times. Multiple staff came up to say hello and inquire about their health. It truly was like the staff treated them as family. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but this is the trade off for staying in a luxury hotel set among Amsterdam's charming canal houses. Otherwise, the rooms and bathrooms are first rate. The hotel's location is perfect if you want to immerse yourself in life along the Amsterdam canals. It is one block from the Anne Frank House and various options for touring the canals (e.g., personal electric boats). The hotel is not as convenient if you want to step out of your hotel and immediately be at the entrance to the main art museums.","Got here at 1:30PM told I had to wait till 3PM to check in, there is 3 checking parking spots and one was fill all day by an employee.

Was greeted by a ""securityguard"" to attempted check us in.He was a dodgy looking character with a 14"" blade strapped to his hip.We had problems with our booking and was told not to hang around outside the room.There was something dodgy going on in the carpark.Dodgy people hanging around,random vehicles coming in and out looking to be up to no good.And then there were the rooms.Disgusting! stunk,bathroom was dirty bed sheets were dirty and had burn marks and then we found both beds to contain bed bugs and dog hairs.i couldnt bring myself to stay there so just uppd nd left without even wasting time asking for my money back.The comfort inn 3 miles up is only $25 more and is safe,friendly and really nice. We know you get what you pay for so we were not expecting much. The room was dirty, the shower had mold due to a leaking faucet. We could deal with that, but when someone gets into your room while your gone and takes a number of personal belongings, you need to go somewhere more secure. When we told management, we were accused of making up the story to get a better rate. When we tried to check out because we didn't feel safe there, we were charged an extra $40.00 for a late checkout. This hotel was a bit disappointing. Based on reviews in this forum we spent two nights here to take in some Cactus league games. The location was convenient. No problem checking in, the room (a suite) was very large: actually two normal rooms with two bathrooms, two TV's, small fridge. King beds huge and comfortable. There were some problems. Two lights in the room did not work, one shower did not work, and the rooms, while certainly not really dirty, were not as clean as one might hope. Neither bathroom had tissues. There were a couple of small pieces of TP in one bathroom floor, a bottle cap on the floor in the bathroom, and the last occupant's cell phone charger was still plugged in. The room was quiet except for late night partying by a group by the pool just outside our window. A/C and heat worked fine. This room was away from the freeway had no freeway noise. The breakfast was standard fare for a hotel in this class. Part of the problem here may be that new owners are not up to speed, but in any event I'll probably look elsewhere next trip. I was there 2 times this year. unfortunately, the last time I forgot a personal item, after many calls to The Manager, I have been unable to get item shipped to me. Can some one else Help ? ? ? Stayed here for 3 nights, was looking forward to it with the good reivews, but we had a completely different experience. The palce was rundown. No snacks except stale popcorn in the lobby. Our room was very dirty, black hairs on the blankets, danky smell, Put water through the coffee maker for tea adn it came out brown, toilet had urine on it, bathrrom sink faucets were dirty, no bath mat in the bathroom, etc etc.. We are not clean freaks by any means, but this place was pretty shabby and divey. You sign a waiver that you wnt' smoke int eh room, but the peopel inteh roomnext to use, regularly were coming out of hteir room with a lit cigarette in hand. We listened to them party until the wee hours. Breakfast was basic, no sausages, but they did have waffles. Pool was nice, but spa was closed. They have a bbq by the pool, but who wants to eat in a smelly dark room with no utensils or plates? Next time we'll stay somewhere else.",,,
Colin H,2514360,"I love this property, as it's really well located close to bowery/east village and all of the restaurants and bars that come with the neighbourhood. The rooms are a lot larger than almost anything else I've seen in the city, and it's got a laid-back feel. The mini bar is very cool and well stocked, without being too overpriced, and the design has real character. Hands down the best vacation we have ever had. We had a heck of a time getting to Maui due to delayed flights, missed connections etc. When we arrived we were informed that they had upgraded us to a partial ocean view executive suite due to our troubles! It was just what we needed. The room was clean and had an excellent view. The staff and service was second to none, friendly and always greeted us by name. They were very accommodating to our two year old daughter as well. They had a diaper genie in the bathroom and her name spelled with sponges on the ledge of the bath. We will be making this an annual trip for us to the Four Seasons Maui!

You are paying for a room only. There is no common space, no lounge, no front desk, no doorman, and no staff whatsoever after 10 pm. To charge these prices for so little in the way of services, the rooms had better be pretty great, and they are â large, beautifully if quirkily furnished, with comfortable seating, good firm bed, luxy bathroom and working fireplace. The pictures on the website are accurate. The problem is that if something goes wrong after hours, you are basically out of luck. In our case, the issue was a noisy party in the room below us, perhaps not a big deal for some people but it was very annoying for us. We tried both the operator and the âafter hoursâ number â no answer from either. Ultimately it proved impossible to get hold of anyone on the hotel staff. The party ended eventually, but it would have been a big concern had there been something more seriously wrong. It was well into the following week before we got a call back from the hotel about our complaint. The staff when they did finally get in touch was apologetic and comped the room for that night, which we appreciated. So just be aware â lovely place in a great neighborhood, but casually managed. More like living on your own (amidst gorgeous Victoriana) than being pampered by a full service hotel. We've just had a week in NY staying at Lafayette House. I booked it because I wanted to explore this part of Manhattan and come home to a working fireplace each chilly evening. Well - the location was great but the fireplace was a big disappointment. When I enquired about using it, I was told that as 'it wasn't winter yet' the fireplaces were not working. This seemed a bit unkind because it was definately winter weather - everyone on the streets was rugged up in overcoats and boots and scarves etc. We arrived at around 10pm and, as arranged, collected our key from the bar next door - all good. But our room was freezing when we checked in and the central heating radiators were stone cold. I called the 'after hours' number, which our 'welcome' letter advised we must not hesitate to use, only to receive a recorded message asking me to leave a message. All very unsatisfactory. However, once we sorted out the heating (without being able to light the fire) we got used to the hotel and enjoyed the area. Lafayette House is quirky and quaint, albeit rather shabby, but I won't stay here again. One of the nicest guesthouses in Manhattan is on a side street in the quickly being gentrified Bowery near all the East village boites and the boutiques of NoLiTa. Owned by the same duo behind the Maritime and Bowery hotels, of its 15 rooms, all have working fireplaces and cosy chic Parisian flea market decor. I also love that the keys to the front door are left at the Bowery Bar next door, which also provides room service, if you arrive after six (when the manager leaves). Almost didn't write this review because i didn't want anyone else to find out how good this place was in case we couldn't get a room next time. Each room is unique and the style is old world brown stone new york, with a hint of a 1950's brothel vibe. Great bathrooms. Make sure to ask about the best rooms as there is some major variance. it kind of feels like your living in your own apartment, which is great but don't expect room service or any service for that matter. Great location and cosy fireplace in each room",,,
RobGeorgia,109391,"Read lots of issues about the Hotel shuttle. If landing in terminal 1 as you exit the terminal you will see the rental car kiosks. Right next to Hertz is the hotel kiosk (see picture) ask them how to get to the shuttle and times. I have also included a picture of where you can find the metro (photo 4) this is across from the hotel and is call the Emirates station, very easy and safe and clean. Hotel is about 5 to 8 mins from the airport. Hotel it quite, the business center is super basic. The breakfast although free is marginal at best. No wifi in rooms (cable) but they do have wifi in the lobby (not free). This is a good hotel for a one night layover. Front desk seemed pretty busy all the time.Take the metro to Deira City Center (drops you at the mall and less that a 10 minute ride on the Metro) for shopping and eating. Also can take the metro to the Dubai and Emirates malls but have a longer travel time. Found the hotel clean and staff friendly. Behind the hotel is a Marie Calanders (restaurant) and the only issue I had had to do with the hotel parking. I guess there is a policy to have a parking pass on your car to remain in the parking lot. Was not informed of this on check-in but had a notice on my car in the morning warning that parking is for guests only and you risk getting towed. Only stayed one night so I didn't seek to get the pass from the hotel office. Nice hotel for being in the same hotel chain as ""The Knights Inn"" Friendly staff and room priced right. I had only two issues the traffic noise (hotel is close to a major road) was unreal. I suggest a room on the third floor and toward the back of the hotel. Also the room had the smell of bug spray. Room had flat screen tv, microwave and frig. Again Nice Hotel overall!","I was booked with my family by American Airlines due to flight delays. The room that was reserved was not available and there was no flexibility by the staff to help us. I wrote to the GM Sanjay Varma but my request for refund were ignored. Great example of bad customer service that can hurt a brand. Avoid this hotel if possible. Nice hotel for being in the same hotel chain as ""The Knights Inn"" Friendly staff and room priced right.

Room had flat screen tv, microwave and frig. Again Nice Hotel overall! The hotel was a good value for the price. The location next to a strip club wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't bothered by it at all. I got a room on the first floor behind the front desk and right next to the elevators. The room as a nice size with a king size bed as well as a sitting area. the ceiling were really high, which was nice as well. It was a bit noisy as there was a cheerleader competition in town. Lots of young girls in cheerleader costumes running around. The breakfast was good in the morning. Hot food, sausage and potatoes along with other options as well. I choose to stay here when my company sends me to a hotel. I have stayed many times, and have found the staff, breakfast, and rooms to be of high quality for my needs. The breakfast is always hot with eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, and juices. I get plenty to eat to get my day started. Very easy to get to off I-35 close to downtown. I have been traveling to Dallas for business for about 3 years now. I stay at this hotel every time I go. I also have clients who stay at this hotel as well. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the management is great! It is close to the airport and just a quick ride to downtown. I would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling or visiting Dallas! I was there for 2 days. Except the breakfast and the shuttle service, I didnt like anything about the hotel. Flush in the bathroom was not working fine. Refrigerator was not working too. The air conditioner was loud and noisy. We were very dissatisfied with our stay. Prior to making the reservation online, we called to confirm if the King Suite with Jacuzzi had a separate stand alone whirlpool in the room or just a bathtub with jets. We were told it was a separate stand alone whirlpool in the room. We re-asked twice to make sure. This was our sole deciding factor on staying at this establishment over less expensive, closer, and higher quality hotels in the area. When we arrived, we found a dirty, bug-infested, dark room with just a bathtub with jets. Many of the light fixtures in the room did not function. The coffee pot outlet did not function and had to be moved to the bathroom to work. The room was noisy and had bugs. Our two keys often did not work in the door, and we had to go down to the front desk to have house-keeping let us in. The staff acted as if the was our fault and did nothing to try to remedy our situation. The check-in and out was fast, but the staff was not friendly in the least and did not crack a smile even once. Upon checkout, we were not asked how we enjoyed our stay and the attendent seemed bothered with our presence. We could have saved $50 - $100, even with choosing another room in the same hotel, but we were given false information. On top of that, the service and room was terrible. It was a very nice place for the price (though next to a strip club). The staff was friendly and the place SEEMED clean, but there is an obvious insect problem. The first time I went into the bathroom there was a cockroach scurrying across the floor. That's not really a dealbreaker, but in the middle of the night both myself and my brother were bitten multiple times by bugs. I'm praying that they were just flees and not bedbugs (dear god please let them not be bedbugs), but I don't have any evidence that they've followed me home yet. Still, I'll be ripping apart the sheets and doing a thorough mattress inspection of every hotel I stay at from now on. This was so disturbing. My family and I were staying here because my 2 yr old son had a procedure at Children's Hospital the next morining. We get to our room I pull out the sofa bed and find the sheets all mangled and hair and dirt on the sheets. I call to go ask how a the bed is put together are the sheets just thrown in, she said yes so it will fold back up...I told her the bed looked used she said that someone goes in behind the maid to check the rooms and assures me it is fine. I call back and say I want new sheets, it takes 30 min and still no sheets.So i fold the bed up half way and while my kids are playing they find used sex toys....Well long story short we moved rooms only saw the manager once did not get any compensation for all the incovenients. Very poor service I should not have had to communicate between the front desk the manager should have stepped up. Now I have put a complain in to corporate so maybe they will do somenthing now...The room was nasty and service sucked!! I choose this Wingate each time I travel to Dallas. The staff is so accomdating, the rooms are clean and roomy. The breakfast buffet is open til 9:30 am for those mornings we can sleep at little later. I love that there is an INDOOR pool and hot tub so I can relax and unwind at the end of the day. Location is near enough downtown to be convient yet not in the hubbub of city. I would highly recommend this hotel for it's value, hospitality and comfort.",,,
lovetheyucatan,297229,"We enjoyed our 5 night stay at Hotel Plaza. Rooms were spacious, clean and beds comfortable. We stayed in the 2 room/suite with small kitchen and decent sized bathroom with large shower. Plenty of hot water w/good pressure! Nice staff and room cleaned very well daily. Great Location! Thank you for your hospitality everyone and hello to Gina at the front desk! We will be back! My Mom! Aunt and I stayed at Pension San Juan for six nights in January 2012. The location can't be beat! Located on fifth avenue between 6th and 8th, with the beach just around the corner. Lovely little hotel and my second time staying at PSJ. Our room was king room that sleeps 3 and had a cute private courtyard. The communal patio/kitchen on third floor overlooks fifth avenue and is great for people watching, relaxing and having a bite to eat. If you want to purchase some food at a local grocery and make breakfast or lunch or have a cup of coffee, then this is a great option. The staff were all very friendly and professional and did an excellent job keeping everything very clean. Beds and pillows were good and our room was fairly large and quiet. Bathroom was clean, functional with a large walkin shower. We also had an outdoor shower in the courtyard/patio that was handy to rinse off after visiting the beach! Would not hesitate to stay here again!","We have stayed here now for 4 plus years... we will not book anywhere else and recommend to any friend or family coming to stay. The hotel is clean, friendly , inexpensive and we are well taken care of. It is family owned and the same staff are here year after year. They always remember us and welcome us back. We never worry about leaving our personal things in our room - it is perfectly safe and we trust all the staff without question. We LOVE this hotel! Every year its like coming home.

Would not hesitate to stay here again! After they tore down our favourite place we had to find another. We have tried many other places in Playa, but for $49.00 this place is hard to beat. The rooms have a fridge and air conditioning and there is an upstairs deck that has a fully furnished kitchen. Not that we ever cook there but it is nice to have some plates and utensils in case we pick up a roasted chicken or pizza. Also there is a water cooler on every floor so you can refill your water bottle if need be. Also a coffee pot on the top deck for you coffee hounds. We stayed at the Pension San Juan because I loved the looks of the outside of the hotel on previous trips. We had the front room on the 3rd floor with domed ceiling. The room was spacious with plenty of storage. We had a king sized bed, a fold down couch with drawers under it, a vanity, large closet with plenty of hangers and shelves, an in wall safe and small fridge. Everything was very clean and in good condition. It was great to sit on the blacony and watch people. The shared kitchen veranda was a nice addition with all the cookware and appliances you needed to make a snack or simple meal. The staff were helpful although there was a bit of language barrier as we speak very little spanish, but eventually we understood and found what we were looking for. The only negative was night noise. Our first three nights it was not a problem, but Saturday night even ear plugs did not help. Still I would return as it was a very nice hotel.",,,
shiny62,98045,Very nice Holiday Inn. Clean and quiet. Note: Follow the directions to the entrance carefully. It can be tricky to find otherwise. It is frustrating to be able to see the hotel but not able to get to it. The hotel is in the middle of an interchange. Convenient (though not walkable) to Best Buy and Target and many restaurants. The room was nice. Pretty much what is expected of a La Quinta. The only negative is that the hallways VERY strongly smelled of smoke. Quiet. Convenient. Close to many restauarants and a mall. The room was pretty nice. The rest of the property needs some updating. The guest rooms are not close to the front desk. It is a walk past the convention center to get to the rooms. There were a lot of Fed Ex planes landing just over the parking lot at night (would be fun for kids to watch). The room was nice. Pretty much what is expected of a La Quinta. The only negative is that the hallways VERY strongly smelled of smoke. Quiet. Convenient. Close to many restauarants and a mall.,"My boyfriend and I went to Memphis for his birthday. When we checked in we told the desk clerk what we were in town for and she remembered us every time we came through the lobby. She even told him Happy Birthday on his actual birthday. We had a little trouble with the A/C and went down to the front desk to report it. The maintenance man was in our room within 10 minutes. We had a very nice stay and will definitely stay here again. If I had to pick a con re: this hotel, it would be the cost of breakfast. I thought a continental breakfast was free, but not here. Although we did get one free breakfast by siging up for Priority rewards. When I checked in as a Priority Club member I was assigned to room 1026 on the Concierge Level. When I got to my room I found the bed linens on the floor. There were dirty food containers in the room. It was obvious the room had not been made up. I returned to the front desk and received an apology. I was then assigned room 908. Due to my change in room assignments I was unable to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast for Priority Club members on the Concierge Level.. I worked out in the fitness room, all was good there except the TV did not work. I called the front desk for repair-no one came, When I tried to take a shower the shower hed sprayed water out on th toilet instead of in the tub. I requested repair from the Front Desk at 7:00 PM, the repair was not made until 7:40. The towels were threadbare with torn hems. Needless to say this is not what I expect from Holiday Inn hotels. As a Priority Club member I use Holiday Inn hotels exclusively. Very nice Holiday Inn. Clean and quiet. Note: Follow the directions to the entrance carefully. It can be tricky to find otherwise. It is frustrating to be able to see the hotel but not able to get to it. The hotel is in the middle of an interchange. Convenient (though not walkable) to Best Buy and Target and many restaurants. I have found that this hotel is by far the best one out of the hotels i've stayed in the memphis east area. From the time I checked in to the time I left, it is like being home away from home. The one thing that I really appreciate about this hotel is the customer service, it is unsurpassed by any measure, and the staff there is the friendliest i have ever seen. I travel all the time and I would choose holiday inns every time. The hotel needs some updating. The furniture was old and beat up. They have tube TVs. I ate at the hotel three times and the food was barely ok. The whole ""hot"" breakfast buffet was cold, the pasta at dinner was undercooked and room service took twice as long as they said it would be. The staff in the restaurant was not friendly or helpful. The front desk staff was friendly though. It was very quiet on my floor though which is great for light sleepers! I would probably not stay there again. My family and I had such a great stay at this hotel. It is right in the middle of everything we wanted to do. From the shuttle drivers, front desk, to the waiters and cooks everyone was so wonderful and helpful. Even the GM was walking by me in the lobby and greeted us and actually asked us how our stay was going. She actually cared enough to ask. I have not had that happen in a long time!!!! Kudos to the entire staff and I will be back!!! The Bed... That was the only good part about my stay. The Shuttle Driver was nice as well, but my room smelled like STRONG BLEACH!!! and it gave me a massive headache. The bed was comfortable, but I didn't sleep very well due to the bleachy smell in my room. I used my priority club points for this, and given my overall stay, I wish I hadn't. :-(... Oh. and the light in the corner by the window did NOT work. >:-( So much for sitting up and reading. The front desk clerk was very rude on the phone and in person. Lashona I believe was her name, was not helpful to say the least and seemed she had other priorities that were more important then to help her guests.... It was the most unprofessional I have ever seen a front desk clerk act at a holiday inn! Have stayed here many times over the past three years and always enjoyed my stay. The afternoon reception is good and the drinks are free. Shuttle drivers are friendly and are available to take you anywhere close by. This is an older property in a nice area east of Memphis. As others have noted, the entrance is a bit awkward, but nothing the hotel can really do about that. Every encounter with hotel personnel was very friendly, I was greeted with a smile at every encounter, from the front desk, to housekeeping, to security, to the doorman, to the shuttle driver -- you really felt welcome at the hotel. My observation was that the common areas were clean, more importantly, the room was as well. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were of the quality you would expect at a hotel of this class (basically not silky, but not sandpaper, perfectly comfortable). Really, aside from the awkward entrance to the property, the only knock against the hotel would be that it is an older place, and you can tell that the carpets and some furniture (though clean) are worn and the in-room tvs are the older style -- I would imagine when this hotel gets the new Holiday Inn upgrade it will be top notch. And yes, the complimentary lemon water in the lobby is very refreshing on a hot summer day! We stayed here for a family gathering and found it to be very pleasant. Rooms were very nice, clean and spacious. The staff was pleasant and helpful. There are restaurants in the area, however the hotel is a little difficult to get to from the highway. Used the lobby and pool extensively for getting together with family - very nice facilities. This Holiday Inn is quite nice. I enjoy the rooms, they are large and well-appointed. During the week, a Priority Club lounge is opened for ""happy hour"". The hotel shuttle is available to take you where you need to go in the area and there is a restaurant/bar in the hotel. One thing that really bothers me about this hotel is the pool. It's indoor and I have often found it to be a bit dirty. It is also a sort of maze to get to. I had the best time at this hotel. Great location, great service, we had a blast. Upon check in we were welcomed by a very friendly desk clerk. Getting to my room it was very clean and everything that we needed. The food and beverage staff was great! The bartender was very friendly and knew a lot about the area. Anytime I come to this area, this is the hotel that I will be staying at!!! This Holiday Inn is well-maintained, clean, comfortable, and employs a friendly and efficient staff. It is located in East Memphis, away from the main attractions of this city, but is surrounded by many fine restaurants and B-BQ eateries.",,,
Hannah J,529193,"This hotel was nice, but it took a good hour to get into the centre of Rome (15 minute walk to the train station, 30 minutes on the train, then onto the metro). The staff were friendly and the breakfast was nice, nothing special though. You have to get there early for breakfast, else they run out - at 8:15am once, they had already run out of croissants and also had no hot water on this occasion so tea/coffee was off the menu too. The only fruit was tinned peaches/pineapple in syrup. The rooms were good, quite large, with a nice bathroom as well. The TV is all in Italian. However, for the price we paid, it was a decent enough hotel, and I was happy with the service they provided.

Well, that seemed like a fantastic idea when we booked the trip months in advance....not exactly the case when I found myself 6 weeks pregnant and sicker than I have ever been in my life. I had a miserable flight down from Canada, was horribly ill and on the verge of a complete breakdown when we arrived at the hotel at 8:30am. I had checked in advance about early check-ins, due to the popularity of the hotel and being at full capacity nearly all the time, they don't do early check-in. I spoke to the gentleman at the desk, explained the situation, and begged for a room so I could lay down and try to beat the morning sickness. I can only assume I was some pale shade of green at the time. He took one look at me and started clacking away on the keyboard. Within 60 seconds he handed us a key and asked if there was anything else they could do to assist. I burst into tears I was so grateful and thanked him profusely. The room was great, king sized bed, sitting area and a retro bathroom. Once I was able to sleep for a few hours, we spent a lovely afternoon exploring the Big Apple. I cannot thank the staff of the Hotel Edison enough for such wonderful and compassionate customer service.

The only fruit was tinned peaches/pineapple in syrup. The rooms were good, quite large, with a nice bathroom as well. The TV is all in Italian. However, for the price we paid, it was a decent enough hotel, and I was happy with the service they provided. When in Rome... definitely use the metro! Get in amongst it with the locals as that helps to take away a lot of that ""tourist"" feeling you get when visiting the key destinations in this wonderfully alive city. I fell in love with Rome and would go there again without hesitation! This hotel was a little bit out of the way (public bus to the train station then approx 30 mins on the train into the city itself) but that suited us fine. There is free wifi at this hotel which seems to be very rare across Europe. Small bathrooms (typical for Italy), comfy beds, clean rooms. The breakfast was pretty impressive - probably one of the best I had during my 3 weeks travelling around Europe. Lovely outside dining area which was great for a relax and a few drinks in the evening after it had cooled down. The bar staff weren't that friendly, but the beer was cold! Reception staff were great! Would stay there again for sure. We booked last minute from the hotel website so we got 1 night free (3 nights/paid 2 nights). The hotel was clean, good car parking lots. The staffs were active and nice. Free wifi but you need to ask for the new username and password at the lobby everytime you login (each username uses only once login) The reception will give you 2 hrs+ login period depending on your request. I liked this hotel because my family of 5 could stay there without breaking the bank. The breakfast was good and the location very convienant to the International schools (St. George's, AOSR, and MMI). The service was good and very friendly. The family rooms are big. The double my husband and I had was small, but had everything we needed including well priced snacks. My wife and I spent three nights at this hotel to explore Rome, after motorbiking through Tuscany. The hotel is in a quieter suburb and tucked away from the main Via Cassia road. The room was comfortable and a good size, and breakfast was included. The secure garage was ideal for leaving the motorbike, as we found the station for the direct train into Rome only 15mins walk away and cost only 1Euro each way! The train journey was about 30mins into the city. It wasn't worth the hassle of riding into the city so we thought this hotel ideally situated.The hotel does not have a restaurant, however they did recommend a good one about 10 mins walk away. The receptionist was very helpful and marked all the main points of interest to visit in the city, which meant we got the most from our visit. This is a nice little hotel very clean and very good breakfast.There is also a free parking. The personnel at the reception are very nice and very helpful. You can buy your train ticket from them, a lot more convenient. The train to go downtown Rome is not far away. It takes about 30-45 minutes. The cleanliness was ok, the staff was very nice, location- a bit far from the city center, but- quite close to the beautiful Bracciano lake:) Only the noise from the street disturbed at night... (but we wanted a room with balcony:)) 17 km to Rome city center, not 8 like they describe in the site of the hotel.simple.clean.that's all.all the others are very poor.if you can avoid this hotel,just do it. Thank you Hotel Cassia staff, especially Salvatore. A great hotel, with the support of night staff making sure an early morning departure to transit and the airport went as smooth as possible. No complaints; lots of praise; I'll be sure to stay with you again when next in the area. Theo I apologize for misspelling his name. Please correct ""Salvatore"" as necessary. He's a fantastic member of your staff. This hotel was close to the train station, main roads but not so close for restaurants. The staff especially reception were very accommodating and did everything to make our stay comfortable. We had to walk a fair distance to the restaurant that the hotel recommends but once you are there the food is really good, don't have the discounted menu, have the a la carte it is still very cheap. However, they don't open until after 7pm. It is very clean and even though it is on the main road, you cannot hear the traffic, the train only takes 20 mins to the heart of Roma. Hotel Cassia is a very nice hotel. The rooms were clean, the staff is very friendly, and we had nice sleep quality of the beds. The trainstation is near by. It's about 5-10 minutes walk. The best you can do in the city of Rome is to take the first day a card for the trains/metro and bus for 20 euro. You can do everything by bus and metro. We have seen almost every place in Rome by foot, but the last day we did all by metro and bus and that's better!! When you want to eat, you can eat at piazza's (near by pantheon or other nice places) that's big money, because your paying â¬6,- euro for a Coca Cola and then the food maybe 15 euro's, but if you go by metro or bus to TRASVERTERE (They are the old streets of Rome) there you can eat very nice and it's is a lot cheeper than when you eat at any other place. You pay for 4 courses about 15-18 euro. We particularly liked the friendliness of the staff. they were very cooperative & informative. The location of the hotel was also very good as the public transport was nearby & easily available.",,,
minettobia,1233358,"I traveled alone for business and I needed internet connection for my job. I choosed this hotel because on the web site there was a mention about internet connection included in room's facilities! IT'S NOT TRUE! You have to pay minimum 6 â¬ per day! When I complained to the Director with a letter, he ignored my complain. Anyway, the hotel has a very poor standard. The building is old, the rooms are crumbling and the environment noisy. The breakfast was so poor that only a naive tourist can accept this standard from a 4 stars hotel with that rates! I was supposed to stay a week: I left after 2 days! I will never come back again! We booked a room ensuite but when we arrived at the hotel we discovered that the bathroom was shared with 7 other people! The room was so small that we couldn't open our luggages! No chairs, no angers, no AC or fan. We booked a twin bed but there was only a single bed a little bit larger! Absolutely not a silent place: we couldn't sleep well because the stairs and the doors of the rooms was very old and too noisy. The environment is not quiet at all because there is a pub thereabout. When we complained about the room, the owner gave us another accomodation in the next building at the 5th floor! This second room was a mansard, larger and with shower but the windows was too small and there was a lot of hot. The bathroom was three floors downstairs! We had the same problem with noise during all week. The breakfast was very poor and the first day we had to wait 20 minutes to take it because the breakfast room was too small. So, the hotel's standard is very low and doesn't worth the price we paid! I will never come back again and suggest to a friend!

Home made breakfast was tasty and service was excellent in cramped dinner room - Breakfast was only acceptable part of visiting. The rooms have not toilet. Shared toilet in corridor was not as big where a normal sized man could sit and thing - when you have number 2 thing, you had to keep the door open - not very nice. Do not imagine hairy legs etc... There is a tiny portable shower in the room, dusty air, mouses, smell etc.... huh - never again. The room was dirty and very small. The sheets on the bed had hair on them from some previous guest. The shower was blocked and the water presure very low. There was an old fridge in the room and not realizing that it was not switched on I opened the door: there was rotting food inside and the smell was terrible. The window did not shut properly so the road noise from outside kept me awake. They had no other rooms and I had arrived too late in the evening to find anywhere else. Probably my worst hotel experience ever. I stayed in a new refurbished building owned by the rex it was 4 doors down it was good value although i did not make it to breakfast on the 2 nights i stayed here We had well in advance booked an ensuite room with two beds. I had read that some persons were cheated, but that surely would not happen to us, we are nice people =) But of course that was exactly what happened. At first they tried to give us a room whithout toilet and shower. Then we showed them our copy of the booking. In the end we got a VERY small room with one bed. The sheets were less broad than the bed, so we slept on the mattress itself. But the room was very clean! After two nights we were moved to a room with 2 beds. This room was the most filthy you can imagine. Never cleaned. I got so much allergy, so I had to SIT all night because of coughing. The breakfast was very good! But we have never ever had so bad service. We were totally deceived! Guys, I found a MOUSE in my room! So disgusting! Dirty rooms...don't come here, unless you want to share your space with animals!!!!!!! We booked a room ensuite but when we arrived at the hotel we discovered that the bathroom was shared with 7 other people! The room was so small that we couldn't open our luggages!

trobaba,1436873,"The hotel is about a 4 minute walk from San Marco, and about a 6 minute walk from the Rialto, so if you want to be near the most popular sights the location is great. Remember though that there is virtually no neighborhood life here; it's all commerce and tourism. Anyway. My room was new, very comfortably furnished, clean and modern bathroom. Helpful staff, good breakfast with cold cuts and croissants. Wireless internet was free on the deal I cut. If you get a good price, as I did in January, you will definitely feel that you have lucked out. The hotel is partners of some sort with a nearby restaurant (Trattoria da Gioia I think it's called), and they will recommend that you eat there. Don't. Restaurants in general in the vicinity seem to be largely run by non-Italians and I am wary of what they serve. There is some geniune ambiance across the Rialto bridge, at the open-air veggie and fish market; there is also some nighttime action at some wine bars on that side. The Goldoni cafe, practically around the corner from the hotel, serves wonderful, heavenly coffee. The steep flight of stairs leading up to the hotel may be an inconvenience to some, but I had no problem with it. I had a good stay and consider this place to be an above-average value. The other reviews say it all -- squeeze down a tiny alley, climb the stairs, to find a very basic but clean and functional room, in a convenient location. The Ritz it ain't. Checkin is next door, zero poetry, no service, but if you get it your room for 50 euros or under you are getting an OK deal. Having stayed recently at a fancer hotel in a ""better"" location (Rialto-San Marco), I would like to point out the advantages of the Moderno's location. You are next to the train station and the vaporetto hub, so that's all good. But I want to praise the neighborhood, Canareggio, which is a real neighborhood and not exclusively tourist oriented like Rialto-San Marco. There is an open air market on the Campo San Leonardo, a 5 minute walk away, and there are neighborhood bars where Venetian townspeople meet to shoot the breeze. The historic Jewish ghetto is a short walk away. Venetian food being generally mediocre and overpriced, you might consider taking at least some of your meals at the nearby Brek cafeteria, where the chow is no worse than elsewhere, but considerably cheaper. Consider all this as you book your room. My double room was spacious and modern, not much of an antique or palace ""feel"" but quite comfortable by North American standards. Bathtub fixtures are something out of Star Wars, but I was able to get clean. The price -- under $100 U.S. dollars -- was definitely a bargain for Venice. Hotel values are outstanding in January in this usually-pricey town. The room had a view on the square; by craning my neck I could see the Grand Canal and the Rialto fish market opposite. There are nice canal views from the lobby/sitting area, and a roof terrace with great views. Hotel location is excellent, in real-people Canareggio rather than the tourists-only San Marco neighborhood. Breakfast was copious; I wish, however, that the coffee had come from the kitchen rather than from the machine. I have read some critiques on this site of the personnel, but everyone in my experience was efficient and courteous. I requested a late checkout (noon rather than 11 AM) but was refused; not really the sort of treatment you expect in a ""palace."" Nonetheless, a good place to stay in Venice.","Just spent 3 nights in this hotel and highly recommend to any travellers to Venice. The hotel is well located between St Marcos Square and the Rialto Bridge. The rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated in Venetian style. Buffet breakfast is included in the price and includes a wide range of fresh fruits, cereals, breads, hams, cheese etc and freshly made coffee. Price includes free wifi. The staff are incredible, friendly and really go out their way to make sure you enjoy your stay in Venice. Fantastic value for such an expensive city. San Luca is very well located, near to San Marco and to Rialto, but still neither noisy nor too crowded, as it is on a narrow side street. The buffet breakfast is excellent, although sometimes the tables are not sufficient if many people arrive at the same time. Rooms are nice, bathroomes excellent and well furnished. the staff is extremely heplful Hotel was fine and more than satisfactory(but do not stay in the dark and dungy Annex). Service, room, breakfast more than satisfactory. On one hand the location is close to things-on the other hand this makes it noisy. The whole San Marco location was just teeming with tourists in May-enjoyed taking the Vaporetto and going to quieter areas. Venice is a bit overwhelming at first. The hotel is about a 4 minute walk from San Marco, and about a 6 minute walk from the Rialto, so if you want to be near the most popular sights the location is great.

This hotel was tucked away and really quaint. We stayed in the annex. The room was large and right on a canal. We could walk to everything, the location could not be beat. I thought it was a good value. The man that ran it was wonderful and jovial! Had a pleasant stay! Breakfast was organised with a espresso/latte/cuppucinos served as requested. Lady at breakfast and at the front desk ever so helpful. Internet wifi access needed to be improved as it was a bit of touch and go! Free day trip to Murano to a glass making factory tour was a great bonus!! Clean and really quaint venetian decor! Luved the room!! Location was perfect within 2 mins of either the Rialto Bridge or San Marco Sq! A small and cosy hotel ,really clean , great ,simple , modern bath room and bright colored decorated rooms which stands out from the other 3 star gloomy hotels with red or dark wall paper. Also the location is great really close to san marco ,you can enjoy a cupatino in the mornig with a simple breakfast. The location of this hotel is very good, it being only a short distance from St. Marks square. The hotel was new and appeared to be clean. However, i was fairly surprised and dissatisfied by the welcome I received from the attendant at the front desk. I was travelling to an international conference in northern Italy by myself and my plan was to stay one night in a hotel in the centre of Venice so that I would avail of my time as best I could while in the city. He appeared to laugh in my face when he knew I was travelling alone and then placed me in the room exactly by the reception. I asked to be moved away from here when shown the room as I stated I wanted somewhere quiet but excuses were made saying it was the quietest room in the hotel! I was after taking a very early morning flight to Venice from western europe and an over-night bus prior to my flight. I was unable to go asleep with all the talking and noise from the reception desk which was just outside my room. My laptop also failed to connect to the wireless at the hotel and when I informed the same attendant at the desk and asked him if I could bring it out, he came straight into my room without any courtesy shown or asking for any permission. I felt this was an invasion of my privacy during my stay and noticed him looking around while in my room. Also, in contrast to the information stated by the hotel, all attendents on the reception desk cannot speak english in a competent manner as the nighttime attendant had very little english. In fact, only that I asked the attendant at the desk the following morning, I would have been given incorrect directions when leaving Venice the following day. Furthermore, when I decided to go to see St. Mark's square at midnight, I was instructed in a most unfriendly fashion that the doors were being locked and that I had only 20 minutes to go up and see it and come back again! I would expect much better staff service from a hotel that charge the rates that this hotel charges! The hotel was clean with good bed, sofa and safe. Bathroom facilities were excellent. Only downside in room 103, next to reception, was that the sound carried easily. It was very noisy in the afternoon if you were trying to have a quiet hour away from the heat. Everything else was perfect.",,,

This is my second time with the Mazoon and they have definitely improved over the last time. The hotel staff are very helpful and they go out of their way to assist. They still have a lot of construction going on and of course the workers would start very early in the morning, but that can be overlooked as they continue to improve the facilities. About the only complaint I really have is their room service is dependent on food brought in and quite a bit of what is on their menu is unavailable to order. The rooms are immaculate and set up quite nicely. I stayed in the executive studio, and had plenty of room; with a refrigerator and a cook top. There were no plates or silverware available, but didn't really need them as we ate out or had room service. The hotel is close by to the Metro, about a 3 min walk. Quite a few taxi drivers/tour drivers do not know their way to the Mazoon, so it is better if you explain to them that it is across the street from the Byblos Hotel or on the same street as the Layia Oak Hotel as those are more established. I went through an online booking agency, so the breakfast and the internet were not included in the total price. The internet is a bit pricey and not all that great...slow to the point of losing your webpages. As far as needing a rental car, I don't see the need with the closeness of the Metro as well as buses available. The hotel does offer limited shuttle service to the Mall of the Emirates and to Jumeira Beach. The pool is quite small, but the jacuzzi is nice. Overall, if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but have good access to it, the Mazoon is a cheaper option. I arrived at the hotel about 8am,and was given my room immediately,the staff were so nice especially the cleaning staff,my room was spotless ,the metro is right next to it which is so easy to use,and a little supermarket across the road which also has lovely staff.the downside the hotel was supposed to face the palm,well maybe it did but there is no way you could see it unless you sat on top of the building.we did not have a balcony and did have a problem with the eletrics and plumbing but things were quickly resolved.I would probably go again.the metro is so clean and the a/c works. We stayed here for just one night, and enjoyed it very much. It was clean, new, modern, and exceeded our expectations. We were in a two bedroom executive apartment and were impressed with the amount of room availabe. The furniture was adequate for the star rating. We would stay here again definitely!",,,
LondonTelegramSam,1526814,"This is actually a fitness centre so the title should come as no surprise. Great rooms and beds. Having to go through the turnstyle each time you want to go from your room to somewhere else is a bit of a pain but on the whole it is a great place, clean and modern with good service and the best spa/sauna area I have ever been to (and it is free for guests!). This hotel is right next to the Chamartin station but the access for cars and taxis is difficult unless you know the location. The views are ugly as well although you can also see the new 4 Madrid skyscapers. If you only need a room and do not want to pay a lot then this is nearly always a good place to stay but there are building works going on now and the breakfast is poor. If you are there is summer they have a nice pool, where you can swim real laps. But as a Tryp hotel it is below average in general. No point in telling you about the hotel, only about why there is no point in staying here, namely 3 reasons: 1. They do not answer the phone: tried calling reception, switchboard, room service and EMERGENCY from the room and there was no reply. Then tried calling them from my mobile as if it were an outside call: NO REPLY. This happened on day 1 and on day 2 so not an isolated event. 2. Asked for a shaving kit and toothbrush. It would be brought to the room - it never arrived. 3. As a platinum member I am entitled to free internet - they still charged me for it. Most hotels, 99.9%, oblige you to take 2 rooms when you are traveling in a group of 4. Thankfully, there are initiatives such as these from Accor, who also have the Suites Novotel concept by the way, to become a bit more client responsive. As it is new, it is also in a very good state. The staff are friendly and I keep going back there, even if I am on my own, because it is always practical to have a little kitchen and a sofa/living room area rather than always lying on the bed to watch tv. If you do not need to be in the centre but somewhere to the north of Madrid then this is the best hotel around. Also has a great pool and spa and sauna but for that they charge you 18euros, even if you are an SPG platinum member! The place is modern and well-maintained, it has comfortable large rooms, I think they only have suites. In my case the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The prices are at the high end but not extorsionate unless you want to have a beer on the terrace outside at night, but then the terrace really is very nice on a summer's evening. This hotel is not very old and has only just recently joined the Sheraton brand. This was highly necessary as the only place in town so far was the very expensive Westin Palace. Now all Starwood need to do is open a Four Points or an Aloft here as well..... More than most W hotels (and that is saying something!), this one tries to be too stylish and the result is probably an either you love it or you hate it reaction from guests who stay there. I personally did not like it - it is too dark, everyhting is black and dark purple, add to that some of the narrow corridors and oddly shaped rooms and the result is not a success. But the quality is good - rooms, beds, bathrooms, amenities, staff, food are all above average. It is also in a good area, it is new so that always makes it more agreeable than a hotel that needs maintenance.","it was a really nice surprise to find such a quiet hotel near a great road as Kurfursterdamm; no noise inside the room; very nice room, with open space and high ceiling, very functional and comfortable furnishing ; the beds and pillows allows a good sleep ; the atmosphere is really relaxing ; the reception people are quite kind and helpful It is not by accident the word ""hotel"" is last in the name of ""Aspria Spa + Sporting Club + Hotel"", it is as if they as an afterthought have fitted a few hotel rooms inside a fitness club. Wonderful if you are into fitness and wellness. I found the gym well-equiped, with a 25m swimming pool and multiple rooms for cardio and resitance training. The spa was nice. We had a couple of good massages, and V-- had an excellent facial and pedicure. The saunas are not for the shy though, German rules meaning nudity apply. The hotel rooms were excellent, spacious and modernly designed. The breakfast buffet was good as well. The only bad thing about the place, is that it is not very centrally located, being near the far end of the Ku'damm and quite a distance from the S-bahn. It does not look like it is that far on the map, but it is just the massive Berlin blocks that trick you. We found the Aspria Hotel Berlin simply superb! Hotel is in a quiet location just a few steps from Ku-damm and only a short walk to the next S-Bahn Station. Some good restaurants can be found within 10 to 15 mins walk, the nearest one is just around the corner. The hotel itself has a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and moderate prices. The staff was highly professional, helpful and very friendly; we arrived before noon, and they arranged our room to be ready much before the regular check-in time! great! The room was quite spacious and clean, with a modern and functional design, safe, Wi-fi internet (free of charge), large writing desk, really comfortable beds, a very large bathroom (bathrobes and plenty of towels included) and a lot of space for everything. We had a room on the rear court, which was very quiet: no noise at all, neither from outside nor from neighbouring rooms. Breakfast was served in a beautiful ""winter garden"", and it was excellent. Of course we visited the ""club"" (entry is included in the room price!) with gym, swimming-pool and spa. The spa on the fifth floor is great, with several saunas, jacuzzi, steam-bath, silent relaxing zones with comfortable beds, and a beautiful open-air terrace with chaises-longues and a small pond. We also enjoyed the ""Aufguss"" ceremony, which takes place every hour. A fabulous treat! It is also possible to have a light snack and a drink at the spa Bistrot. We can highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again when in Berlin. Prices are moderate, and it's also possible to find good deals through the on-line reservations, especially in case of early bookings. It's a club rather than a hotel: To go to your room you cross either the spa or the gym. It's close to the lower part of Ku'dam (West Berlin), rather quiet (few restaurant) and close to Tegel airport, but you'll have to take a bus/cab or walk 20 min to get to more busy/lively part of town. It's a great relaxing place with very friendly staff! Super value for money. We really loved this hotel and would like to come back again. At the beginning it is a bit difficult to find out where what is, in the end it is a health club with hotel, and not the other way around... but when you find yourself out, then it is a very good experience... Rooms are modern and big, there is sauna, swimming pool, massages, spa, etc... everything you can imagine, and just some steps from your room. And there is even a kindergarden for babies, we didn't try it out (this time) but I guess (hope) it is for hotel guests as well.... The hotel is not in the center of Berlin, but just 5 bus stops from the shopping street KurfÃ¼rstendamm, which is great. I Summer you can even walk this distance. By the way, try the restaurant just at the corner (Eiffel), it has great food at a reasonable price, and we were told that Sunday brunch is excellent. We want to try the next time we are there, because we will definitely repeat! What a great hotel... But it really is more a health club than a hotel. How many hotels have entry barriers?! But it's fantastic. Modern, big rooms, great service and really convenient. I was there on business and ended up here by accident. But I'd go back for leisure or for business. You walk through the health club to get to the hotel but hey - it's got nice carpets and it's incredibly civilised. Great value too. This was a great find. The hotel is very modern and comfortable. The room was spacious and quiet. The spa is excellent with several choices of sauna and steam room. On a Saturday evening, there is a sauna master who gets the sauna to a very hot temperature, so take an bucket of ice in with you to keep your head cool. After the spa, I came out very refreshed. The breakfast in the morning was excellent. The only criticism I would make is that the rooms are quite a distance from the reception and spa. Nice hotel, in the vest side of Berlin. We loved the training facilities, the workout classes where good with welcoming instructors with one exception (don`t try hip hop!!!). The spa treatments wonderful, the spa area Iâm sure is nice but not to our taste. Location is ok, but you need to use the busses, trains or subway to get to most of the city (Brandenburger tor is a 2,5 hour walk away). Donât think we ever waited for more than 2 min for the bus. Only small negative thing is that the room cleaning could be better (hair in the shower that did not belong to us) . They also forgot to give us soap, slippers and toilet paper. We would also like a place to sit down after a long day out. Since there are no chairs and no bedcover, you need to sit directly on the bed linens. Overall a good experience and we would love to come back. This is actually a fitness centre so the title should come as no surprise. Great rooms and beds. Having to go through the turnstyle each time you want to go from your room to somewhere else is a bit of a pain but on the whole it is a great place, clean and modern with good service and the best spa/sauna area I have ever been to (and it is free for guests!). My colleagues and I spent 4 nights here at a trade fair and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, the rooms are top class and the spa and sports facilities are second to none. It was a shame we were in Berlin on business! Every detail of the decor has been carefully chosen to provide a harmonious whole - as befitting a spa where relaxing and tranquillity should be the key. The hotel is located only 10 mins by taxi from the Messe area, although the walk to the S-bahn station to get downtown is an energetic 10 mins. I will definitely return - next time hopefully with more spare time to enjoy a class or two and not just the excellent pool. Excellent fitness and gym for both, aerobic and anaerobic excersice. Rooms very nice, mdern but still perfectly comfortable. Free cable internet in rooms. Staff very nice. A perfect choice if you chose doing sport or relax after business. Restaurants in surrondings 10 minutes walk. Way to the airport is clearly signed. However breakfest might be more rich. Summing up I recommend this hotel. Actually after my discovery of Aspria in last November I have not slept in any other hotel in Berlin. pro: I had a short but very pleasant stay in Berlin in this hotel, very kind people, nice room, nice swimming pool and fitness centre, near all the most interesting places in Berlin cons: breakfast not so wonderfull as a memeber of La Rasant Fitness Center in Brussels I came across this hotel facility in Berlin. Nice setup for up to a weeks stay, easy access to the fitness center and very pleasnat staff. Good breakfast.",,,
libertylovers,91871,"My mom, son, and myself stayed at this hotel in September. We were originally going to stay for two nights, but only ended up staying for one. The toilet in our first room continuously ran and our second room was less than clean. The front desk still ended up charging me for two nights, even though I had let them know on our first night, that we would not be staying another night. I ended up having to call and get the other night refunded back to my account. The Breakfast area was really busy and it seems that one person was not enough to deal with the mess. All the trash cans were overflowing as well. Usually I have really good luck with La Quinta, but this one did not seem up to the normal standard. The bathroom in the room was really unclean and I didn't even feel comfortable giving my son a bath in the tub.

Overall, I wouldn't stay there again knowing that there are other hotels in the area to stay at. I stay in Las Vegas to go to Death Valley or Red Rock Canyon, so this great hotel on the west side has an awesome location. The pool is open 24 hours and the queen suite I stayed in (their smallest room) was luxurious and roomy and clean. Breakfast was good (waffles) and the desk help was generous and helpful and accomodated a late check out. There are lots of good restaurants around and only a few minutes from Red Rock Canyon. I was unusually impressed with this place and would make a point of returning again. The price was surprisingly reasonable. Very nice place. Staff is really nice and accomodating. Rooms are nice size, clean and comfortable. They have coin operated washer & dryers. Breakfast was limited to wafftles, cold cereal, toast/bagels and muffins. They have a nice outdoor area. The place was clean, but the elevator could use a cleaning. I didn't see any trash in the halls or outdoors. There are alot of restaurants and fast foods within a few minutes drive. As much as I travel, I will be back. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a number of days and loved our stay at this establishment. We really like this establishment as they allow pets to stay with no hassles. Also their breakfast was better than most other hotels. We stayed at and enjoyed this hotel a few years ago, but in our opinion it has declined considerably. First impressions were not great at the dirty and littered side entrance we used to bring our luggage in (it remained that way for our 2 day stay). The hallway on our floor was unbelievably littered with everything from chewing gum wads and wrappers to silly string and more. The breakfast area tables were sticky and dirty and the counters where the food was kept covered in beverage ,cereal and waffle dough spills. Suprisingly (after all this) our room was clean enough and a good size. But we had a major concern on our first day when we returned from a 4 hour outing to find our closed and locked room unlocked with the door ajar about 6 inches!! After ensuring our laptop and other items were intact and seeing the room had been cleaned and restocked, we called the front desk who, to their credit, expressed concern and did make a gesture of taking $20 off our bill. The cleaner, who was several rooms away, came to say she had left our room open as she had not cleaned our bathroom floor but then forgot! This hotel seemed to lack a caring, well trained and supervised staff and we will look elsewhere on our next visit to Las Vegas. This was our second stay at this facility. I noted the cleanliness was not up to par. The hallway had not been vacumed in two days (same litter was on the floor), the coffee pot in our room had an old used filter in it and the pot had not been cleaned. The breakfast bar had a good variety however the spills from the waffle maker were not being cleaned up, had to wipe off a table in order to eat. The person attending to the breakfast area was hustling the patrons around but not maintaining order. Cleanliness needs to rank #1! The rest of our room was clean and neat. We were on a medical trip for surgery. We stay at LQ as they take pets. The staff was most accommodating. Plenty of easy access to rooms and staff willing to haul luggage. Just ask them for assistance. Conti breakfast was adequate and fresh. Inside of bathroom needed some caulking on the tub but it was at least clean and mold free. Beds fresh and room cleaned daily unless you specify otherwise. The gym for workout was great for minor exercise I needed. This LQ is well laid out the location makes for easy access to the city or the outskirts for sightseeing. Located away from the major strip, this LQ assures a quiet night of rest. We stayed for one night with our pet (at no extra charge) had a nice king size bed which was very comfortable. We decided that we had had enough driving for one day and ordered from the restaurant menu that was in the room. The food was great and not to expensive. The breakfast next morning was laid out well and very appetizing. Nice way to start the day. Would definitely stay here again. `Nice Staff, BUT it's a one-man show. The Front Desk was really helpful and friendly, but couldn't accomodate needs from our rooms due to lack of help (personnel), to carry out duties. Maids/Housekeeping very efficient, but few of them. Our room was next to the fitness room. A little small and dated. It would be nice if the bathrooms had locking doors instead of the closet-style doors. Couldn't get the internet to work in our room, but was available in the lobby/breakfast area. blankets were thin and some had holes in them, but all linens and sleep sets were clean. Two Full (not Queen) size beds were small for four people, but overall comfortable. Extra blankets weren't available (they were ALWAYS OUT!). In fairness to the hotel, a lot of Lacrosse Players there for a tournamnet, but, whether lacrosse or anything else, hotels should be able to adjust to the pressure brought onto them. Nice continental breakfast. Endless coffee. Nice pool/hot tub area. I think if there were more staff and supplies, this would be a GREAT PLACE, and you can't complain about the price. An O.K. stay in Summerlin! Suggest also, Marriott Courtyard on Rainbow. We booked this hotel online and specified that the room be non-smoking as my boyfriend suffers from asthma. We arrived and we told the only room they had for us was a smoking one. After much discussion with the hotel employee, and after spending an hour on the phone trying to get another hotel (it was the day before Valentine's Day) and finding nothing we had no choice but to stay there for the night. You might think a smoking room would not smell that bad, well it was like there were 50 people in there smoking, the smell was beyond awful. And it got on everything, even the bed sheets, so we couldn't sleep much, I kept waking up with the smell. We left the next day with all our belongings stinking of smoke, which then made the car smell too. Never again. This was the worst hotel experience ever. And the staff were most unhelpful. We spent the night on our way to California. I usually try to avoid staying in Las Vegas but we decided that this hotel looked like a nice place to stay. We LOVED it. It is far from the strip, and for us that was great. It's right along a freeway but we didn't hear any of the noice. The area that the hotel is in is very nice. There are a lot of great restaurants near by. The front desk staff were great. Check in was a breeze. Our room was a nice size and very clean. The breakfast was ok. We lucked out and got a very good price on our room. We will for sure stay here again!! Our one-night stay was part of a longer trip, so we were looking for convenient freeway access and close proximity to restaurants for dinner. We found both at this La Quinta. It's a newer property, so everything was clean and fresh-looking. Our limited exposure to the staff found them friendly and helpful. The room - a ""Deluxe King"" - was large, nicely decorated and included a reclining chair, a good-sized desk, micro, fridge and coffee pot.. We found the bed to be comfortable. ""Convenience to the freeway"" can also mean ""noise from the freeway,"" but we found it to be minimal and it didn't disturb our sleep. The somewhat noisy AC posed more of a problem, but we managed to rest well in spite of it. The included breakfast was served in a bright, airy room, but was limited to mostly cold items except for make-your-own waffles and a toaster oven for bagels, etc. We would definityly return to this La Quinta. I come to Vegas for business every 4-6 week and travel with my litlle ""Bijou"". The folks here are very friendly and accommadating. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with easy access. It's always a pleasure to stay there. This is an extremely nice hotel. It is so nice that I have stayed there twice, visiting in 2009 and deciding to stay there again in 2010. While it may be more expensive than some of the hotels closer to the Strip, this hotel is very nice. The internet works very well and the rooms are of considerable size. I stayed only one night. The hotel is recent, the room was spacious (but no refrigerator or microwave, unfortunately), the area was quiet. Breakfast was of good quality and variety (self-baked waffles). Internet (free) is wired.",,,
s e,503272,"My friend and I were only in Barcelona for a couple days, so didn't really need a full service apartment. But this property was less expensive than the hotels we reviewed. Our apartment was clean, very spacious -- which was really nice after a lot of tiny hotel rooms with even tinier bathrooms -- and had a lovely ""local"" view of other dwellings which made us feel like we were really living there. The front desk staff were wonderful to us, warm and professional. It was an inexpensive cab fare to/fro Barcelona Sants train station and an easy walk to a lot of sights. (Bus service was a bit trickier for us to get a handle of, but a metro station is closeby the hotel.) The kitchen was fully stocked with wares for cooking and serving. Next time, we'll stay longer and really settle in! What makes this hotel is number one, the staff; our lovely little balcony in the trees, overlooking the street; clean, comfortable room; and of course, the coolest elevator. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem -- we found hotel bathrooms very small pretty much throughout Europe. Really enjoyed the gracious desk staff and the room staff were very sweet as well. It's my hotel in Paris from now on.

It's my hotel in Paris from now on.","The Aparthotel Napols is located in a quiet residential area near the Arc de Trionf Metro station. Itâs not a far walk to El Born, Sagrada Familia and the Waterfront area. Also 2 short stops to Placa de Catalunya. There are 2 food markets on the block and a Patisserie across the street. Itâs 2 blocks to Estacio del Nord to get a Taxi We had a 2 bedroom apartment for me, my wife and adult daughter visiting our son at Residencia Onix which was 2 blocks away. The apartment was clean, well furnished and very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There was a full kitchen, dining room, living room and terrace. Great for families, or anyone who doesnât wanted to be crowded into a hotel room I really enjoyed my stay in this apartment during August 2011. It was in a part of Barcelona that I lived in when I was 21, so the setting was already quite good to me. The livingroom was clean and decorated in an easy, minimalistic setting. The bedroom had two beds and I slept well during my stay. I loved the bathroom too: really suitable for girly girls that want to prepare for a lovely evening in a perfect city for evening-time. I don't think I can add a specific rave about this apartment that has been said before, but I liked the constant guard of the people downstairs, without being intruding on your private life. I would definately return to this particular place. I have stayed in another apartment in Barcelona before, that was quite good too, but I specifically loved the fact it was quite close (traveltime) to the citycentre and the setting around the apartment was charming, cultural and interesting enough to stay around too booked a room for 7nights christmas time. their booking site somehow booked us a room in the other location in barcelona but one e-mail to the booking manager fixed everything. no hussle at all. our triple apartment was very clean with 2 bedrooms,big kitchen, living/dining room and a bathroom with everything you need. they even come and clean,wash dishes and change towels everyday. our room(E4) was a bit noisy sometimes possibly with water pipe? other room toilet or shower noise? but not that you cant sleep or anything - we were very tired each day after so many things to do and see. but i can see some people might have problem with it. friendly staffs - all very helpful and kind with good english. location was also good, close to 2 metro lines. easy to find the place if you have any kind of map - a bit difficult first time if you havent got a map. we had a really nice christmas holiday in barcelona staying at the aparthotel napols. thank you My friend and I were only in Barcelona for a couple days, so didn't really need a full service apartment.

Next time, we'll stay longer and really settle in! We were slightly concerned about the location of this hotel to various historical sights, but once we arrived, we were proven wrong. We were walking distance to many places -- Arc de Triomf, Sagrada Familia, Placa Catalunya, La Rambla, Barri Gotic,vPicasso Museum and the Harbor. Granted, it took 15-20 minutes to walk to some of these places, but the walk was beautiful. We walked through different neighborhoods which gave us a better feel for what Barcelona is really like. It was also close to a metro station which was great. As for the hotel, you get what you pay for. The staff was very nice and the rooms were fine -- good enough to get the job done. My bed was sloped and the towels weren't always clean, but that was all surpassed by the fact that we were in a great neighborhood, not too far from the hustle and bustle, but far enough. Our party (5, including 2 young girls) stayed for 4 nights. Great apartment, with nice in-room amenities. The location can be a bit difficult when travelling with small kids/stroller: a bit of a walk from the subway station. Many times, when we wanted to talk with the front desk, staff, he was occupied with other things: phone, chatting with other guest, taking care of the car park customers, etc. Despite that he was quite kind. Note that it's not a hotel, it's simple an apartment with cleaning service once a day. Very nice location with the bakery and groceries just across the street. This was a very simple, but very clean place. Staff is well intentioned however a bit relaxed about everything. Although I have informed them our late checkin in when I arrived there was no one in the reception for 30 minutes and I was about to book and pay for another hotel that someone showed up. Expect very relaxed and casual ( but friendly) service. Clean room, really good location ( close by to everything, 15 minute walk) and quite surrounding. Have some pastries from the bakery right opposite of the hotel. This is two bedroom apartment, with lining room and balcony, very spacey, clean, in good resident area near center of town and near of metro station. They don&#039;t have restaurant because this is apartment with full equipment kitchen. Stuff do cleaning room and change towels also they wash dishes in washing machine. Please do yourself a favour and do not go here. I had read a number of reviews of the hotel losing reservations but just thought hey, that won't happen to me. Well, it did. Despite taking an over 200 euro deposit and three confirmation emails they lost our 5 day reservation and sent us out on the street. They were rude and unapologetic. After ruining our vacation and then finally realizing they did take a huge deposit from us, they offered us a discount to stay there again!! Please do not stay here, many MANY other more professional places to stay. I had planned to spend 3 weeks in Barcelona, by myself. I had never been there. The hotel's location is great. Close to the touristic parts of the city (between 15 and 30 minutes walks). The apartment (4.6) I had was great, comfortable, and cleaned everyday. Very small kitchen but one can manage. All the food stores you might need are not even a minute from the hotel. Only problem I found was the noise from other apartments sometimes, and the unpleasant sounds through the ceiling of the furniture being moved for cleaning (it would be easily avoided if some felt pads were placed under...I meant to mention that to the staff but forgot!!!). I found the staff charming, helpful. Without any hesitation, I would go back to the same place whenever I would be in Barcelona.",,,
grj11188,306743,"Located at the junction of Havelock Road & Outram Road, this hotel is located opposite the busstop for Orchard Road etc.. Its about a 10 minute drive to China Town.. Only disadvantage is a 10 minute walk to the nearest MRT station (Outram Park) but otherwise well worth the money.. Rooms are very large and well appointed.. The large spacious lobby, circular room arrangement & the atrium with 5 elevators gleaming like pearls on a string lend a magical appeal.. Large lobby with ample sitting area makes for a good setting for a relaxed coffee meet in the lobby and extended bar area with live music everyday.. The breakfast was good with a large spread.. Their lunch & dinner buffet seems to be very popular even with the locals and features a wide selection from across Asia.. Stayed here for 6 nights and not too much to complain about.. The entire experience was quite a disaster. Check in was a long process with not adequate seating area in the lobby area. Rooms are quite small and rather in need of renovation. Staff is not efficient and needed constant reminders before the tasks were completed. Overall horrible experience. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone else The rooms are clean, roomy and give an amazing view of the Singapore skyline.. The breakfast was the highlight with a large selection of items.. This hotel is well located near a mall and a train station.. Staff are helpful and efficient.. Got a complimentary late checkout which helped as the flight back home was rather late in the evening.. My room was spacious and well appointed and offered an excellent view of the city skyline. The hotel pampers fitness conscious guests with an excellent outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, a fitness center and a spa. Breakfast at Brunch Cafe was good and wholesome. The staff is warm, attentive and amazing. The hotel is located close to the Opera Metro station and thus makes travel around Paris easy. We visited the health club sauna. Our room was spacious and luxurious with modern appliances. We enjoyed our continental breakfast at their Restaurant La Verriere. We visited Galaries Lafayette which is close to the hotel. Although the suites are clean and decent as well as the food served being good, this hotel has a bar downstairs with blaring loud music till late at night. The bar also serves as a pickup point for call girls so the hotel is an absolute no no for families.. Being a converted post office this hotel has old world charm not found easily. The rooms are large and airy, but the most appealing part about this hotel is the breathtaking view from the outdoor pool. The staff are friendly and attentive to your every need making the overall experience incredible. Will definitely come back here Nicely located close to the tube station, restaurants and bars, the room was clean, large and spacious. The hotel staff were efficient and friendly.. Overall it was a good experience with nothing to complain about The hotel is located across the road from the Gare De Lyon which allows easy access to the Bastille, Louvre and other places of interest. The hotel is very basic and well suited for a quite stopover or business meet in Paris. Rooms are small but comfortable although the bathrooms are quite small and outdated.

The hotel is located in the heart of Bur Dubai with easy access all around.. The rooms are posh and well appointed with all the modern amenities.. They have a wide variety of food choices as well with international options as well as Indian & Goan restaurants. They also have an african dance club.. All in all a fantastic experience.. The hotel is situated in the heart of Bur Dubai just minutes from the creek, the gold souk and meena bazar.. The airport is also not too far away and much of Dubai is accessible by short taxi ride.. The rooms were neat, clean and cozy..Breakfast was standard fare but good quality and a good spread..Would stay here again The hotel is located across the road from the Gare De Lyon which allows easy access to the Bastille, Louvre and other places of interest.

Large spacious rooms allow for enough of space (often lacking in hotel rooms). The staff were friendly and courteous. Breakfast was good. Overall a fabulous experience The Ramada Hyde Park overlooks Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. The rooms are elegant & modern. Paddington Station is nearby which allows for easy access to Heathrow. The fashionable shopping areas of Oxford Street and the West End theatres are nearby. The breakfast was wholesome and watching the sunset at the Arts Bar was just magical","I stayed here in June, 2010 alongwith a few friends. We were looking for budget accomodation and so selected this property. But what we were not aware of is that it had a Indian Dance Bar and an African Dance club within it's premises - the main reason why this hotel is not suggestible for families. Rooms were ok, nothing to complain about really. Bathrooms were ok too, they were clean. But service left a lot to be desired. Twice it happened that during breakfast, when we were filling our plates from the buffet, the staff just ignored us and started to remove the food. It's true that breakfast is served till 10 AM, but who would like someone lifting off the food when we are standing right in front of them. Again the next day, we ordered some glasses to our room. The waiter came to our and informed that they had kept a couple of glasses in each room. When we informed them that those glasses were already used and dirty, he simply took the glasses to the bathroom, cleaned them with his hands and gave it back to us (which was just disgusting) Overall try to avoid this property, but if you must stay here due to your budget, do not expect 3*** service. My firend had booked hotel thru Jet Airways package and was staying in the hotel. I visited the hotel to meet him, i was surpirsed they didnt offer any parking and told me they give parking to people visiting restaurant of their cheap Indian Dance Bar or African Pickup joint. With difficulty i managed to get the parking somewhat far, receiptions stopped me from approaching lift and asked me to deposit my ID inorder to visit the guest staying in hotel. When i requested for receipt for my ID he misbehaved and threatened to call security. He behaved very rude and infact humilated me and said i am illegal resident of UAE. It was shocking service/approach of the front office staff. My friend reported the same to Jet Airways cordinator very next day and she refused to take any action and just gave cool reply she will refer to concerned department. It was awfull, Guest who expect to be disrespected please book your room in the hote. anybody looking for fancy things in a hotel will be disappointed with this hotel.but it is a very conveniently located neat and clean hotel in dubai at a very reasonable price.they have a couple of good nightclubs also for those who want to experience nightlife of dubai.reception is professional without being friendly.when i asked them for a toothpaste in my bathroom,they said it would cost 5 dirham.what they sent was a combo pack of a toothbrush and a toothpaste which was finished after two applications.i did not need the toothbrush anyways.breakfast was mediocre.i suggest people should eat less at the hotel and eat at one of the many wonderful eating joints nearby.buses are availabe just outside the hotel.metro station is a ten minute walk away near burjuman mall all in all a no frills good budget hotel,enjoy dubai and have a good night sleep in your room at palm beach I booked the room through travel Agency .When we arrived at the hotel in the first week of Dec 2011,we were surprised to see the small sized property. .I could guess there itself the standard of the hotel.It was small.Front desk staff were brusque,unhelpful.rooms are small,bathroom was dirty.Surprisingly they didnot provide the basic needs like coffee maker,bathrobes,sleepers,Toiletries were a small soap(size of a coin INR) and a small pouch of shampoo.Thats all!!even there is no temperature control.Either you have to switch of the AC or bear the shivering chill. The only saving grace was excellent location and ok Buffet breakfast. I stayed there 4 nights and location is very good. Needs lots of professionalism in their operations. Buffet breakfast quality is average and very limited choice. Like most of the hotels not working toasters, no water, not cup for coffee, unfilled juice/milk and uncleaned tables. But due to its location it attracts lots of people. Not a stared hotel but a nice place to stay. Rooms are good. Breakfast is included in the tariff. Very conveniently located. Most of the tourist places are within walking distance. Buses, Taxies, etc. are available near the hotel. We had taken a package of Jetescapes for Dubai from 2nd Feb 2011 to 7th Feb 2011.For the first 4 days we stayed in another hotel and for the last two days we were shifted to this hotel.The entire hotel stinks.The wash room near the lobby smells of drainage.The staff at the reception is not co-operative.They are very arrogant.They do not bother to drop their customers to the airport.They just have only one mini van to drop the passengers to the airport.If there are many customers the have to make their own arrangement to the airport.The breakfast is also not in keeping with the tarrif charged.No one sees whether the buffet items are there or over.Tea coffee and juice is servedat the breakfast table in themocole glasses.What a disgrace.Overall zero value for money. The travel agent booked us into this hotel and we agreed to go ahead though the reviews were mixed. Hoped to have a good stay since it was only 3 days and we booked at short notice. When we landed at the lobby at 1.30 pm the rooms were not yet ready and there were a whole lot of people hanging around who had come in even earlier than us and still no room though check in is 12 noon. We then decided to have lunch and return. Still, no luck. We managed to get in our room by 3 pm. Moment we stepped in there was a foul smell from the bath area. The staff stepped in immediately and sprayed freshner, but the smell continued. We then requested the hotel for a change in room which they promised to do the next day as they were running full that day. The room they shifted us to was good-neat and clean. The breakfast was atrocious-no body was there on the desk- u have to hunt around for spoons and cups-refills not happening on time-in short chaos. I think it would be better if they reduce the rate so one can go and have the breakfast elsewhere. The location of the hotel is central and there are a lot of Indian restaurants available nearby where one can get good food. The computer street and electronic street is within walking distance and so is the burjuman centre. The staff was very courteous and helpful, but I would not like to stay in this place again. We stayed in Palm Beach hotel at Dubai for 6 days, located in the main center nearest to all the malls, airport & the Main Bus stand too. They maintain very clean in every aspects. I feel this is the only hotel you will have all kinds of Indian Cuisines either Kerala, Tamilnadu or Goa & Punjabi according to your taste. There is south Indian night club & Mayfil for North Indians. They also maintain a separate cesa of Goa with purely Goa atmosphere with Konkani taste. Those who want to enjoy their trip at Dubai, may stay at this hotel, I very strongly recommand for it. It was best to stay and enjoyed complimentary breakfast too. This was offered to me by JetEscapes as a 3 star property. The hotel was a dump. Maybe it wished to be a 3star or was a 3 star, but that is definitely not the case now. Old smelly linens are the norm in every room. The room that was given to me first had a broken toilet seat. I had to request and fight for a change! There are 2-3 night clubs in the hotel. The crowd at the hotel is not very great, but there is no problem to anyone staying in the hotel. The main problem is that the night clubs are open till 2-3 in the morning. And, they plan LOUD blaring music all night. The noise insulation is pretty bad and so, it is difficult to sleep in certain rooms. The location is good with lots of access to public transport. A heaven for the visitor without a car available on call. I was able to easily connect to the public bus and metro service from there. All in all - Avoidable. Unless that is the last hotel on the planet! Its location is one of the best as one can get all connecting buses and is easy for travel, its rooms are clean, but accesories like television is pathetic as they only give 10 channels out of which only 2 channels one can see properly rest are blurred. There are discs below which play very loud music and disturbs your sleep, even the breakfast is average. Can be visited for its best location. I visited this hotel with my wife and was intially hesitant because of the reviews but All in all I was happy with my experience. I intailly booked it for 2 days ( I was visting Dubai for 2 weeks) but eventually ended up extending my stay in this hotel for 2 weeks. Loved evey bit of it ...especially ""CASA DE GOA"" . I had my dinner almost every other day in ""CASA DE GOA"" .... I heard it recently had management changes and new management for this restaurant has changed everything upside down and has made it just prefect. I would visit this hotel again just for ""CASA DE GOA"". The hotel is located in the heart of Bur Dubai with easy access all around.. The rooms are posh and well appointed with all the modern amenities.. They have a wide variety of food choices as well with international options as well as Indian & Goan restaurants. They also have an african dance club.. All in all a fantastic experience..",,,
Dominique H,282463,"We stayed at the Hotel Nelligan for a family wedding. Immediately upon our arrival we were greeted by a friendly and extremely helpful staff. Whether calling for the car, getting our luggage or sending wine glasses to the room, everything was done quickly and everyone was friendly and professional. The Hotel has a nice warm feeling with the exposed brick throughout the building, yet also brings a nice modern touch. We found the food to be excellent. We would definitely highly recommend this hotel. Being a student and attending a conference at the J.W Marriott, this motel was a fantastic price within walking distance of the conference and LA Live, as well as a Metro station. The rooms were cleaned every day and the place was spotless, the only problem with our rooms was the lack of a wardrobe and there were no coffee making facilities. However, for the price that we paid (a twin room worked out at roughly Â£240 for 7 nights) and for the little time that we were planning to stay it was perfect. Our only issue was the area. We were warned countless number of times by taxi drivers that the area we were staying in was really bad. We were warned to stay away from the park (MacArthur Park) and not to walk alone especially at night, when we were told not to go out at all. This was backed up by any locals that we spoke to. There are a lot of homeless in that area and people trying to sell fake ID. Occasionally we did have to walk back to the motel from LA Live and it felt a very threatening place to be at night, however, if you are willing to take taxis everywhere then it is a very reasonably priced place to stay. I wouldn't recommend this for families, but if you are travelling on your own, are not planning to spend much time in the motel and are looking for a base for a few days that is cheap, then this place is just right","Being a student and attending a conference at the J.W Marriott, this motel was a fantastic price within walking distance of the conference and LA Live, as well as a Metro station.

I wouldn't recommend this for families, but if you are travelling on your own, are not planning to spend much time in the motel and are looking for a base for a few days that is cheap, then this place is just right Booked 2 rooms on one reservation. Front desk clerk only held one room. Tried to tell me my reservation was not valid because it was ""edited"". (I had changed the reservation online, but had a valid printout and online verification showing two rooms.) The only two rooms available were one of the two that I had reserved, and the jacuzzi suite. Clerk told me jacuzzi suite was very expensive and thus unavailable. After threatening to go and stay with a friend, thus nullifying both rooms' reservations, the clerk relented and gave me the jacuzzi suite. Still charged an extra $10 though. I thanked him and told him I'd give them a ""good review"". My definition of ""good"" is 3 stars, though they deserve zero stars for the incompetence of whomever was responsible for losing the second room on my reservation. Rooms were above average w/rspct to amenities and cleanliness. Kids throwing football in parking lot hit my brand new car. Lady smoking joint on balcony near our room. Neighborhood is somewhat ""sketchy"". Would not want to walk at night. Hotel is arranged like a walled compound (to keep some of the bad elements out)? If you must stay near downtown or Koreatown on a budget, this place is okay (just stay inside). Other than a bit of traffic noise from busy nearby Alvarado Street (and a bit of radio sound from the next room, easily resolved when I asked about it), a very comfortable and enjoyable place to stay, convenient to Silver Lake, Sunset, Eagle Rock, etc. A nice (if a bit carbohydratey) breakfast every morning with coffee, OJ, danish, muffin and a free copy of the LA Times. Lots of nice morning sun on tables in an area outside the rooms. Great staff. Decent sized room with a walk-in closet, and acceptable bathroom. Very inexpensive for what you get. I loved this place!! After reading the reviews I was a bit apprehensive to stay here but I was pleasantly surprised. it had everything mentioned in the booking. a great comfortable bed, free wifi, free breakfast(although not that great or filling - coffee and danishes) . The only thing left to be desired was the absence of toileries in specific not toothpaste and shower cap. Although shampoo available and shower gel were provided. So on the whole I would give it a 4 on 5.",,,
Dibbley,278173,"Stayed here on my sons Stag do, the staff were very accommodating, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathroom again clean, the shower is quite powerful, but the temperature can vary, quite dangerously on occasion, very hot! Breakfast was a standard continental affair, served until 12 so even the late sleepers can indulge. The location is fine, about a 20 minute walk to the main shopping center, or a 5 minute tram ride. Overall I can recommend this hotel for people who just want to sleep, have breakfast and see the sights. I have had the pleasure of staying here on a couple of occasions, and will be returning at the end of November! It's true the hotel is not in the centre of town, but a 15 minute tram ride ( or 25 Euro) is not to much to pay for peace and quiet, I have always found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful and the view of the canal is lovely. I have never been upgraded, but that doesn't bother me as the rooms I have been allocated have been more than acceptable. I think I caught them unawares last time and was sent water and chocolates about 10 minutes after checking in, but that's because I am currently a gold member. Nice touch, it all helps when you are away from home.","Stayed here during a school trip to Berlin in November 2011, it was a really great base for exploring the city. It's just a short walk to the nearest tram stop and you're only a few minutes away from Alexanderplatz by tram. The staff were really welcoming and I think that most of them spoke English, although as a German-language class this wouldn't have presented a barrier for us anyway! There was a small bar in the lobby but we chose to go out in the evenings and we were spoilt for choice! Restaurants litter the mainstreet and the public transport runs late if you want to venture further afield. The rooms were basic with about four beds each - but they were exactly right for us and for a youth hostel the quality was very good! Our stay could have been spoiled by some fussy neighbours but the staff very quickly diffused the situation by reminding them that this is a youth hostel so some noise from the young guests is to be expected! That may be the downside to this hostel - it's not for a relaxing spa experience. It's a rough-and-ready but very welcoming basecamp for people who will spend more time in the city than in their rooms. The only other thing is that it's quite tucked-away and could be difficult to find without local knowledge - but the locals are very nice and willing to help, so there shouldn't be any bother at all!

Overall I can recommend this hotel for people who just want to sleep, have breakfast and see the sights. Stayed here with a large group whilst on a university trip. This is probably one of the most comfortable and clean hostels I have ever stayed in. I say hostel because I would defiently describe this place as more of a hostel than a hotel. The beds were so comfy! The breakfast was ok, im not really a breakfast person and it did start to get a bit repeatative near the end of the week. Bar in the breakfast area is also a great plus to the hostel. Planning to take my mum to Berlin in the near future and I will defiantly stay here. Staff are also very helpful. Also very easy to get into the centre of Alexanderplatz via the tram or U Ban (and also walking if you get on the wrong tram oops). Recommend! i went in April 2011, with my history class, we arrived at around 11am and as soon as we entered the lobby we were welcomed, talked through a few house rules, basic stuuf such as who to contact etc... the lobby is very big with colourful mosaicked pillars that brighten it up, it is really light and airy and there were pleanty of seats, this is also where we had breakfast in the morning, as there was a dining area just off the reception desk, because it was on the 4th floor i think we could have taken either the stairs or the lift, the lift took you straight into the lobby, because there was a lot of us we were split into groups of 5 or 6 and spread across almost the whole of the hostel!, when we got to our room, we found the basic amenities such as a safe/en-suite and there was loads of space between the beds, the room was again bright and airy, with high celings, although therewasn't an echo which was good!, the room was spotless! no cobewbs or bugs or dust, there wasn't even a funny smell, it was lovely :) however the windows were able to open pretty wide which could be dangerous if you had young children...and although there was a large choice for breakfast, it wasn't varied which did become slightly boring after 5 days, the hostel was just off the main street which ment there was hardly any traffic noise and we were literally a 5 minute walk away from the tram line, you were again only a 5 minute walk from the nearest supermarket and there were some lovely resteraunt/cafes within walking distance! i would defiantely go back!",,,
CalgaryCrisdean,271764,"The Good: The Hostal Oporto has one of the best locations I have ever seen in a big city. Its located across the street from the parliament buildings, which are only 4 blocks from Puerto del Sol. About as safe and secure as possible. there is a police presence 24/7. The rooms are a decent size and are cleaned every day. The hostess, M. Antoinetta, is very accommodating. It has free WiFi. The Bad: Worst beds ever. do what ever you can to avoid the double beds. The walls are tissue paper. You can hear a pin drop down the hall. The pipes are loud as hell. Meaning that you are able to hear bowel movements and showers for everybody above and around you. Conclusion: As long as you are leaving early and sleeping late, you should have no problems. The location and value are incredible. Its hands down the most secure and safe location I have ever seen. right in the heart of downtown Madrid. My Wife and I spent 3 nights here while we explored Barcelona. It may seem out of the way; but it is only 4 blocks to two different metro stations. It is a short walk to the Sagrada Familia. It's located right beside the hospital San Pau. The rooms are very nice and the hotel staff are helpful. There are a ton of little cafes around for breakfast, so don't worry about paying 8euro for their breakfast. If you catch the blue line, beware. It is only four blocks to the hotel. However; it is also the station at the bottom of the every large hill that the hotel rests on. All in all, this is a good hotel in a decent location. I would highly recommend it.","Oporto fulfills its purpose of a hostel. Low cost and no frills. It was a great location and we could walk to just about all the sites in Madrid. It was a bit difficult finding its location when we first arrived on the metro, but thankfully some locals helped us find it. Our room had a tiny bathroom with a tiny bathtub shower combo, but it got the job done. No breakfast, but some tasty cafes nearby. The staff didn't speak much English, so we had some funny encounters like trying to get them to help us turn on the fan. I was very surprised when I saw what room we had for a bit more than 50 eur, especially in the center and close to the metro. We took the metro pass but didn't use it as the hostal is within walking distance of the main touristic places : Prado, Pl. Puerta del Sol, Gran Via, Thyssen Museum, Museum Reina Sofia... All this can be reached within 30 min walk. The people at the hostal is very friendly and smiley and they are always available for any question and will always give you advice for whatever you need. Rooms are basic and clean. We had private bathroom, a big bed and a closet, no need for more. The only problem is we had a double room (couple), it was a big bed but with 2 ""one-person-mattresses, maybe add a note if you want a big mattress. I would definitely recommend this hostal. We had an excellent time in this small hostal. It is in a great position right in the city center and within walking distance from museums and main attractions. Staff was lovely and very helpful and the room really clean. The bathroom was a bit small but the shower absolutely great. Perfect if you are staying for a few days and do not plan to spend lots of time in your room. The rooms are basic, we had a room with 2 individual beds, and one full size bed. Perfect for my family of 4. The hostel is very close to the Prado, and to the bus stop that takes you to the airport. Very friendly staff. We were really pleasantly surprised by our stay at Hostal Oporto. This small, family run place is within walking distance of the Prado, the Parque del Retiro, and the buzzing shopping area of Puerto del Sol. The metro is a short walk away so all other attractions are easily accessible. Our room was big, quiet, air-conditioned, and the beds are very comfortable. For the price, it's outstanding value. Our positive experience could have been partly gratitude, since we'd just spent 4 nights in Barcelona in one very uncomfortable hotel, but even without that comparison, we'd be very happy to stay here again.

Its hands down the most secure and safe location I have ever seen. right in the heart of downtown Madrid. have just got back from 4 nights in the Oporto. it is a brilliant hotel for the price. its location is difficult to beat. easy walking to most things and 5 mins to metro seville. the hotel is very clean. the staff were very friendly and helpful. the rooms are not large but if thats what you want in the centre of madrid you will pay more. that said for us we only slept in them and showered and changed they were fine. the showers were good even if the shower room was small and cramped. all in all if your looking for a budget hotel in the middle of madrid then chances are you will find it difficult to better this. A convenient, central, no-frills stay in Madrid--a quick walk to the Sol plaza and metro stop, just steps to the Thyssen-B, and easily walkable to everywhere else in central Madrid. Felt very safe in the area, Wi-Fi worked great, and staff were courteous and efficient. I asked for a quieter room and got one in the back--no street noise to speak of but a little noise from neighboring rooms.The room and bathroom were basic and small, but kept quite clean. The water pressure and hot water were great, but the shower itself was a very small--a little raised square dais with shower curtain on two sides--really hard to keep water from getting all over the bathroom even for a petite female. I have stayed at Hostal Oporto maybe four times over a dozen years, and have always been very pleased. The staff is warm and friendly. The simple rooms have hot showers, large comfortable beds, and strong wifi. The neighborhood is quiet but central: just a block from the Paseo del Prado and Museo Thyssen but tucked away on a sidestreet that gets little noise. For those who want nightlife, the Chueca district is a 10-minute walk (but Hostal Oporto is in a more comfortable neighborhood than Chueca). And the price, 35 euros for a single, cannot be beat. There's even a vegetarian restaurant right next door.",,,

After moving on after 4 nights at Shelter Island we arrived early by taxi at Diamond Head, We were able to go to the straight to the room, The rooms were very good & better than expected. The hotel was ideal for the beach & visiting other places by bus which stopped at the end of the road.Coming from England it was good that the reception staff were helpful in giving us information. We had originally booked for 7 nights but stayed for an extra 4 nights as well. I was slightly disappointed with the weather for November ( it was only in the low 60s) but we still got around places without a car as the bus/trolley/coaster services were good & cheap. I would recomend this hotel but you would better to come earlier in the year when the weather is better. The room has all you need, we had a queen bed, kitchenette with eat in area and bathroom with a large closet. Everything was in good condition except for the carpet, I think that should probably be replaced in the next year or so just to give the place a nice new look. Our only complaint was the walls are very thin, you can hear people beside, outside and right on top of you, when booking I would ask for the quietest room, maybe on the top floor? The front desk was great, they let us check-in early and check-out late and were very helpful about it. The location is great, you only need to walk a minute to get to Pacific Beach, a walk down the boardwalk will take you Mission Beach, a bunch of restaurants and a fun fair. I really liked the hotel itself. I have stayed there at least three times before and have been satisfied. HOWEVER, they lied to me twice about the price of the stay. I called to add a one nights stay and was told it would not cost anything extra because I had Triple AAA. When I got there they said that person was NEW but didn't even suggest a compromise for the extra nights stay. THEN I had to check out early and apparently the same NEW person ran my credit card for one amount minus the one nights stay which I thought was their compromise. I was not told there would be an extra charge on my credit card for that night. When I got home they charged the extra amount. I think this is very POOR customer service. Diamond Head Inn was a nice surprise for the money. Right on the beach (boardwalk), clean, relatively quiet, and close to a lot of restaurants. Parking is a problem, and like another reviewer the gal in the office moved her car so we could park by the building. No free internet, and no computer to use in the office. Continental breakfast is just ""stand up"" or ""take-out"" coffee and muffins. Good stay, great time!!!! Fantastic location - 5 minutes from wonderful beach. Parking on site. We've booked a room which turned out to be an apartment with a fully equipped small kitchen!!! Beach is wonderful, wide and sandy. You can take a long walk in both directions. In my opinion this is great place for everybody: couples, families, elder people. Restaurants and stores are within a walking distance. Good prices. This hotel was beyond our expectations! We travelled with our two kids and booked a suite. The staff was very helpful and kind. The beach is right there. Our room had a kitchenette which was convenient for making breakfast for the family. The beach is gorgeous and the weather was great!! This hotel is very close to restaurants and shops. I am definitely coming back here again when I come to San Diego!! i was very impressed by the great location of the hotel.The front desk people are very kind&eager to please.The rooms are very clean&up to date.The hotel is located a few feet away from the boardwalk so you don't need to wear your shoes to get to the beach.I definitely enjoyed my stay&I will be back many times. I stayed ten days at this hotel and enjoyed every one of them. The room is clean, updated, spacious, and very convenient with a kitchen included. It is not a glamorous hotel, but it is unexpectedly nice for the price. Parking is limited, but I only had to park a block away three times in ten days. If you want a clean, safe, quiet, friendly hotel right on the beach, this place can't be beat. The hotel staff is friendly and efficient, which added to my enjoyment. This will be my first choice to stay next time I am in San Diego and I will be sure to bring the family. Entrance to hotel room was very well lit at night. Unfortunately, the porch light shined into our hotel room, after dark, so brightly it was difficult to sleep. Our studio hotel room was too well lit up. Thank goodness I had eye covers! Otherwise, we were very pleased with our room, which was well maintained, clean and very comfortable. When I arrived there was absolutely nowhere to park. I was told by the registration desk person that there are only four parking spaces for the hotel, and the rest is first come first served. She invited me to park at the sister facility several blocks away and haul my luggage back across town. I drove around until a parking place came open. The room was very nice but there was no view at all. Right across the very small hall (?) a couple of young women were staying and they were in and out, talking on the phone outside and pounding on doors and slamming doors all night long - until 4:30 a.m. Called the front desk to see if anybody could get them to quiet down and nobody answered the phone. I liked the location and the room but the rest of it was not worth the $149 I paid for it.",,,
TravelingMomma73,87614,"My friend and I switched hotels during our trip as her points at the other hotel only gave us so many nights. Since we had to pay, I wanted to stay at the Embassy. This was the best decision we could have made! We had a corner room with a small view of Lake Michigan. Our room was smaller than other corner rooms I've had at an Embassy, but it was clean and served our purposed well. The mattress and pillows were some of the best I've had at a hotel in a long time. The front desk staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The valet attendants were helpful as well and we didn't even have a car! The breakfast buffett was good as well. This hotel is situated in Downtown Chicago off of State and Ohio Streets and since we didn't have a car, it allowed us easy walking access to several spots. There's a Trader Joes around the corner and well as the Grand Lux Cafe as well as the red line train being a block away. This was my first time in Chicago and my stay at this Embassy made my trip worth it. I went to New Orleans for a weekend ""girls"" trip with some friends. We had only planned to stay in New Orleans for 1 night but decided to change to 2 nights. We couldn't add a room to our existing reservation as that hotel was sold out, so we decided to spend the first night at a different hotel. This was the only hotel in the same area as the other hotel that had a room so we booked it. This was not a happy experience. While we were able to check in early and the front desk staff was super nice, this is where the good experiences at this Hampton Inn stopped. While the room was clean (we had 2 double beds), the mattress on the beds was too soft and one of them kept sliding off the box spring. While the bathroom was average size, the towels were dingy and very thin. The carpet did appear to be clean and the room did not have an odor They did offer the free breakfast and I'm torn on how to review it. I've stayed at the other Hampton Inn in New Orleans and the breakfast there was much better. While this Hampton had the waffle makers, the layout of the food was awful. The food was up against one wall, in a single line, with the waffle makers at the end of the line. It got really congested. The food on the bar was not that great either. The ""omelets"" were the pre-packaged kind and the sausages were greasy. The waffle was good though! Overall, I would not stay at this Hampton Inn again. The positives of this hotel do not out-weigh the negatives for me. Was in town for a short time and my friend used her points to get us a room. Staff at the front desk were super nice during check-in. The valet attendants were all the best. Kudos to the staff at this hotel. The hotel sits across from the hospital and is easy to get to (our directions took us straight there). The rooms were nice. The bed was a little soft, but it was bearable. A little cramped from what I've experienced at other Marriott's but it was nice and clean. The bathroom was the typical hotel size and it was clean. The only problem I had was the water took a long time to get hot and there was not hot/cold reference in the shower. You had to turn it this way and that way until you got it to the correct temp. But overall, it was a pleasant stay. Stayed here during a recent weekend trip with some friends. When traveling, I always prefer to stay at an Embassy Hotel as I like the service for the price. This hotel did not disappoint. There was a big football game in town so the hotel was sold out. We could not check in early but they allowed us to ""pre-check"". The front desk staff offered to keep our luggage but we decided to leave it in the van and valet park in the garage. The front desk staff were very friendly, and offered to call me once our room was ready. We used the valet parking, which is a must at most hotels in New Orleans. No problems here. We proceeded to venture out in New Orleans. After 5 pm I realized that I had not gotten a call from the hotel, so we proceeded back to the Embassy, where our room was ready. I asked why I didn't get a call, and the gentleman behind the desk didn't have an answer. He did apologize though. We asked for a room in the Loft, since I had seen the reviews saying these rooms were nicer, but it was sold out. The room we had though was very nice. It did not open up to the outside as other reviews have stated, and it was clean. There were some stains on the carpet near the TV, and our sheets and pillows appeared to have some ink stains. Not sure what they were but we asked for new sheets and they brought them. The breakfast was really good except the coffee tasted awful. I love coffee with my breakfast and was really disappointed that this coffee tasted like warm mud. The hotel was located within walking distance to several local attractions and a trolley stop. We enjoyed our stay and it was a good value for the price.","Had to bring my mother to Chicago for a specialist at Rush and Marriott was recommended by them. The front desk were very friendly and helpful and the whole place is very clean. The bed's were too firm for me and I woke up many times because of it. I'm sure if I had checked they would have fixed it somehow but my mom needed good rest and I didn't want to wake her. They gave us a special rate since we were there for Rush. The valet service is top notch! The driver's were very polite in helping mom get in and out of the van. Would stay again! We chose this hotel for location, we were attending a concert at the United Center. A bonus is the complimentary shuttle, that took us to our venue and picked us up after. It is pricey with the valet parking and the fee for wi-fi but it was just worth it for us to get the ride to the concert, we could have drinks and not have to worry about it. The hotel was classy, the rooms were comfortable, nice linens, coffee, refrigerator, nice size bathroom. I was not impressed with the way the shower worked, but everything otherwise was good, we had no issues with noise from the streets. If I could improve anything it would be the option for queen size beds, we had 3 in the room so had to take doubles, that just made me cringe, I'm used to a King, and the wi-fi for the price should of worked better. We spent a lot of time (and money) at the bar, Jim was a fun bartender and lots of other concert goers made it a good hang out after the show. We had an appetizer there before the show, the food was good. There wasnt much for food/restaurants in the immediate area that we could tell. Front desk, vallet, shuttle driver, everybody was friendly, highly recommend if your attending a show at the United Center. I stayed at this hotel because I attended a conference on the premises. The staff were friendly and the bed comfortable. The restaurant is decent and the bartender was very helpful for ideas of places to go. Using a room key to start an elevator was a new one for me. The location is good if you are visiting Rush, but little else. If you are planning on seeing what Chicago has to offer, stay in the city, not here. I stayed at this hotel on a business trip. We chose it mainly for its location. The front desk staff were helpful and courteous. The room was comfortable and your typical hotel room. The absolute best thing about the hotel is the free shuttle. It will take you anywhere within a mile, and considering the cold, rainy weather we had while in town, it was much appreciated. He took us to dinner and to our meeting. The valet staff was also helpful and happy to call us a cab or point us in the right direction. The biggest downside to this hotel was the noise factor. It is across the street from Rush University Medical Center. During my 2nd night, I was awakened at 4:44am by a loud ambulance siren. The night before, there were almost constant sirens. In addition, the housekeeping staff gets started unusually early. My first morning, they started cleaning before 8am, slamming doors up and down the hallway. I heard every one of them; it was ridiculous. At 8:30am, I had to put out my ""do not disturb"" sign, because I wasn't ready to leave, yet. I can't figure out why they started so early. I had breakfast one morning in the hotel's restaurant. The food was decent; the service was average and a little slow. It wasn't really worth it. Go out for breakfast if you have the time. Overall, the stay was very good (above average, not excellent), and I'd probably stay here again if I had a another meeting in the area, but the noise really bothered me. We were in town for a short meeting and the hotel was very close to that, but a little far from all the downtown action. We arrived very late at night after a long and the night staff was wonderful. I wish I would have gotten the woman at the front desk's name -- she checked us in quickly and with a smile. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The shower was awesome with fantastic water pressure. Nice workout room. The cost to park seemed a bit high but it is Chicago! Had a fantastic salad in the restaurant and the bartender was very accommodating--even making us his very own ""Chicago Snow"" drink!! Was in town for a short time and my friend used her points to get us a room. Staff at the front desk were super nice during check-in. The valet attendants were all the best. Kudos to the staff at this hotel. The hotel sits across from the hospital and is easy to get to (our directions took us straight there). The rooms were nice. The bed was a little soft, but it was bearable. A little cramped from what I've experienced at other Marriott's but it was nice and clean. The bathroom was the typical hotel size and it was clean. The only problem I had was the water took a long time to get hot and there was not hot/cold reference in the shower. You had to turn it this way and that way until you got it to the correct temp. But overall, it was a pleasant stay. I thought this hotel was clean and the location was sufficient for a stay with regards to the conference I was at. Not a good location to vacation in Chicago. The staff was courteous, however, the internet was down for 2 days and the staff had no time frame or understanding of what the problem was. Just spent five days at this hotel. Staff was very nice- the night shift was excellent! Loved the Starbucks coffee in the restaurant. Buffet was good. Room was very clean - loved the bed linens. Hotel was quiet. Very good stay - wished I had checked more on shuttle service since I was left at hotel while husband was off on business. We made do, but it might have been easier if I had checked on it. Staff recommendations for dining were excellent. Enjoyed my stay! First off this is a hotel for families to stay while a loved one is at the Medical Center. If you want to see Chicago, go elsewhere. It's a basic hotel, no fancy bells or whistles. But if you need a place near the medical center it can't be beat. I spent a week in the same hotel room with my son, post surgery. The front desk helped me find good lunches, exercise, do laundry, grocery shop, get downtown on the trains, etc. The weather was never above freezing, so I needed help to get everywhere. I was surprised when the week was over and we hadn't killed each other! I think this is a good buy. In the medical district for business and stayed 2 nights. I would like to comment on how friendly and helpful the staff were and the well appointed room that met my expectations. Although not a large hotel, the services, food and attention to detail were very good. From the front desk personnel, the van drivers to the wait staff: all were friendly, professional and genuinely caring. My experience here was positive and I would not hesitate to stay here again! We stayed at this hotel because my husband was having surgery. It is rather expensive and parking is charged also but it was so convenient to have a shuttle service to the hospital. Room was comfortable and clean. My only complaint is why put a towel bar directly in front of the sink? When you bend to wash your hands, your body is hitting the towel bar and the towels slip off. Beds were comfortable and staff was helpful and friendly. We were in from Orlando just to see a concert at the University(postponed after we flew in..more on thar later) and this was listed as the closest. Our plane arrived early and Rosemarie at the front desk was extremely gracious and allowed us to check in early. She along with the valet and the front desk staff recommended restaurants etc.. The room was surprisingly spacious, clean and had B&B products. They offered a free shuttle service and the driver was fantastic.. We were so bumbed about the concert and had to have a few at the bar.. The bartender was superb.. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in various parts of the globe and the staff were top notch and provided REAL courtesy!",,,

Went there during July. Don't trust the photos. I booked through Delta Airlines website (Bad idea). Thought it would be a great place since the price was quite attractive. Heck, waste of my money. I believe the travellers photos are enough to tell you how horrible it is. Thank god I was only staying there for one night. If you do decide to stay there. Keep in mind that reservations does not equal reserved rooms. There was a family from Paris that had reserved their rooms there but ended up calling NYPD because the hotel decides to bail out last minute and say ""We're full"". Rooms were dirty, shared washrooms. Beds were horrible. Because we went there during the summer...It was HOT (no fan's nothing). Stay away. Of course hotel is cheap and situated near metro station and southern parts of Central Park. But the rest isn't good. Rooms are big, but dirty and dark, staff is unkind. If you want to rest during NY visit - pay more at other hotel. This place is risky. Reservation system does not work good - they should fix it. I've arrived in NY i late evening. In hostel reception I heard that of course I have valid confirmed reservation, but they don't have free rooms ?!? I haven't got such serious situation in much more wild countries. But this is NY - the middle of civilisation ?! Man in reception told me, that there is nobody responsible for that situation, and today it is impossible to solve the problem, so I should take myself and find any hotel as soon as I can (it wasn't easy). I returned to West Side Inn next day, they gave me back money for more expensive room in other hotel and gave me also little discount for next nights in West Side Inn. No simple word like ""sorry"". Next days I saw many times people on reception desk with the same problem. So I think - avoid this hostel.",,,
Anna B,614758,"Hello Fellow Travellers This was our second trip to the Grand Monarch Cancun. It is a very nice Hotel although quite far from the strip, so you will definitely need a Rental. Our big complaint is with the Concierge Desk who sold us ""TICKETS"" for 2 shows (Chris Angel & Cirque do Soleil Elvis themed) that they charged us $71 per person and which we came to find out, first of all,when we arrived at both shows,, the box offices on location only charge $55 and secondly (and most importantly) that these so called TICKETS the hotel sold us were actualy only ""vouchers"" that had to be traded in for actual tickets once you reached the show. We were led to believe that these so called tickets would have us bypass the box office. WRONG,,, not only did we have to get in line at the box office to trade in the vouchers purchased at the Concierge at Grand Monarch Cancun but then when we reached the box office after standing in line for 1/2 an hour then we were informed my husband (the purchaser) had to have picture ID ti do the trade. Needless to say he left his ID in the car, not knowing he required it, he had to get the Valet to retrieve the car to get the ID. We had 6 in our group (including both our mothers over the age of 70). After all this chaos we missed half the show and the Concierge Manager (Mark Curry) would not (and said he could not,, do anything for us!!) Nothing,, can you imagine,, No wonder they say What happens in Vedgas stays in Vegas,,,, they rip you off. I've sent a complaint to his manager,, stay tuned, I'll let you know what comes of it. We loved our recent stay at the Palmer house. It was our first Chicago experience and the hotel did not disappoint us! We loved all the history of the Palmer house. Our room was nice and cozy and there was lots of great food and experiences close by. Hello Fellow Travellers This was our second trip to the Grand Monarch Cancun.

Great location - 20 minutes from the hotel door to Centraal Station on the metro, and ample free parking. Bed and Breakfast price good for a city centre location. Rooms are fairly basic but clean and comfortable The only downside is that there are no hairdriers in the bedrooms, and when I asked at reception, there were non available. We booked this hotel three nights for our city trip to Rome. Even though it's not right into the center of Rome it's okay for what we needed it for. To be honest: There were better and worse hotels in my life before. The Holiday Inn Express Rome was something in the middle. Our room was clean, the bed had a good size for two people and there was enough space to put our cases aside. As well as that there was a pretty large balcony and tv. I can't say something to the latter because we didn't use it. We weren't lucky and got a room in which we heard the arriving and departing trains from the train station Tuscolana. Because of that it was impossible to open the windows during the nighttime, so the room was all airless and uncomfortable. No good sleeping in there. Breakfast was good, except for the orange juice. If you want to reach the city by train and then go further to the sights you have two options. First there is a metro station within 10 minutes walk from the hotel, named Ponto Lungo, which takes you to Vatican City in short time. Secondly there is the already mentioned train station Tuscolana. From there we went to the historical center of Rome and it has a good rail connection to the airport which was a plus. It's 350 m from the hotel, a 5 minute walk. We didn't use the buses at all. All in all the Holiday Inn Express was okay but nothing special. Nevertheless it was a good starting point for our trip to Rome. If we come back we would stay there again but would definitely ask for a room which is not on the train side. This was my first trip to Branson and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My two kids had a great time!! The Hilton was clean, classy and we loved the included breakfast (you have to purchase the breakfast package). The pool was nice also. There were only two problems during our stay...on Sunday there was a loud techno pool party (not kid friendly) and wireless internet is not complimentary. Other than that it was convenient, friendly and upscale. We were a little skeptical of this hotel after seeing the area but we were pleasantly surprised. The lot and hotel were plenty safe (we left our car in the lot during the day and took the trolley and never had a problem). The hotel has been renovated nicely and the room was comfortable and tidy. The hotel staff was very friendly and gave good recommendations about what to do in Memphis. The trolley station is a 2 block walk (the area does look a little iffy, but we never had a problem) and it goes directly downtown to the mall and Beale street. The only downside was the trolley does go down the street in front of the hotel and it can be a little noisy every 16 minutes but after awhile you start to tune it out. Would definitely stay here again.","stayed here during I.B.C. week on Beale St.Very nice,quiet, clean.Staff most friendly and helpful.Trolley to downtown block away,or if your up to it can walk,only 2 miles.Excellant breakfast.Will definetly stay again,next time in Memphis Our stay at this hotel was very good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was nice and clean. The breakfast was good. Although not in the most scenic part of town it is a great value for the money. We felt safe and secure. It is close downtown without the high prices, and it is also close to the hospitals which was the reason for our stay. We checked out a few of the other hotels in the area before we booked a room and this was the best price. We also mentioned that we had a family member in the hospital nearby and they gave us a discount. We needed to stay an additional night so we called the hotel from the hospital they took care of it no problem. Also this nights stay was at the discounted price. We would stay at this hotel again.

Would definitely stay here again. I pulled into this great little in town gem after driving 500 miles. It was clean and quiet. My room was spacious and well appointed. Although the hotel is located in the medical/university area, it is a short trolley ride to downtown and Beale Street. Equally convenient 10 minute drive to graceland. Free breakfast is much appreciated as there are no restaurants walkable....eat before you come. Whe I arrived I had a terrible headache and the staff hurried my registration so that I could get to my room and relax. The room was comfortable and I had the best nights sleep I had all week. The morning staff was super friendly. This was a great experience and I will definately go back. We found this online after spending the previous night a few km further out from Beale street. It was a clean, comfortable room and just what we required. It was a bit of a walk to the Trolley line, but we were comfortable walking there during the day. The taxi ride back from Beale street was quick and convenient. We found out a day after we left that we'd misplaced something in our room, and they were so kind as to keep it until we could go back and pick it up. Excellent service, and we will most certainly stay there again. My sister and I recently stayed at the Gen-X Inn while attending an event at my son's college. I have tried other hotels in the mid-town area and I will be returning to the Gen-X. The hotel is located near several colleges in Mid-Town, yet is a trolley ride away from the downtown area. The lobby and our room were very clean and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. Our room was quiet and well appointed for the price. The staff was very attentive, greeting us each time we entered or exited the hotel, and responded quickly to requests. Over all we had a very positive experience and will be returning. Other than the Holiday Inn, I had been unable to locate a hotel in mid-town Mempho. When Holiday Inn could not accommodate me, they referred me to the Best Western Plus Gen X, which is located immediately north of the Holiday Inn on Madison. I had not found this hotel on previous searches and did not expect much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. For a walk-in price of $99 (plus $20 in taxes), I got a fresh, clean, attractive room that was larger than expected. There were many upscale touches (big showerhead, fluffy towels, nice wall paper) and the staff was friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is the pits, but we walked about a half mile to Minglewood Hall for a concert and returned on foot after midnight without incident or threat, but I kept my eyes open while we walked. The parking lot is fenced and covered by security cameras. The trolley runs right down Madison past the hotel to downtown, but doesn't go far east past the hotel. I think this hotel is as safe and $50-$75 cheaper than what you can find downtown. I found the new looking wood floors in the hallway very attractive, but they may not muffle noise as well as carpet. We did have Wi-Fi while we were there and there was a decent breakfast bar in the morning. We spend time in both downtown and mid-town town so the location is great. We do not spend much time in the room but the level of cleanliness and comfort is still very nice. The personal are professional and pleasant. My family and I have stayed at this location many times over the past two years and have always been happy with our stay. It was impossible to obtain a bottle of water, no vending machine and staff had no water when asked - twice. Location too far out of town unless you have a rental car. Staff only provided one small bar of soap and one wash cloth for two guests. Also the continental breakfast was extremely sparse - not many choices. We have stayed at Best Western's frequently, and this breakfast wasn't adequate. Memphis isn't what one would call updated. Frankly just driving around it really looks like a poor city. Too bad too because the people are friendly and welcoming. The Gen X is a relatively newly renovated hotel and it is well maintained. The staff was generally accommodating - there is very little offered at the place aside from breakfast cereal too early in the morning. Still, in a town full of great restaurants, that wasn't a problem. We were very happy with the location - just a stone's throw from Beale, The Lorraine, Sun Records, and not that far from the ballfield, Stax or Graceland and Cockadoos for breakfast! Went to Memphis for Gonerfest and this hotel was on a list of good hotels to stay at. I have to say that they were right. Seems to have been recently updated....rooms very clean with new flat screen tvs. Bathrooms very clean! ( major points for me )! Staff was friendly. Located next to an animal hospital in an industrial area but really just min by car to most attractions. I would def stay at this hotel again Stayed one night in late July, found the hotel on Expedia and chose it for its rate and proximity to downtown Memphis. Found the hotel very clean and new looking. The room was very nice, small bathroom, good tv and dvd, was all around comfortable and we were pleased. Did not make it down to the continental breakfast, but had good in-room coffee. Unlike some other reviewers I found the place and the parking felt very safe. There was an iron fence around the whole of the parking lot, and did not seem like a run down neighborhood to me. Very easy access to downtown Memphis and very easy to get in and out. I would stay here again. I would highly recommend staying here. The room was quite lovely....flat screen tv, dvd player and the bed reminded me of the nice beds at Hyatt chains. It had a very upscale feel to the room. The bathroom was very nice also. The price was great....great bargain. The staff was very friendly and helpful. And I loved that the hotel was right off of I40...made it very easy to find. Will definitely stay at this hotel again when in Memphis. My sister and I stayed one night at the Gen X Memphis. We were greeted and checked in quickly by the friendly desk attendant. Although there were only two elevators, there was never a wait during our stay. The rooms were great! Very spacious, new flat screen tv, all modern furnishings and the beds seemed new. The sheets were 100% thick cotton (this is important to me!) and the rest of the bed linens were natural fiber as well, no unpleasant polyester here! The beds were very comfortable, with fluffy nice pillows. Both the room and the bathroom were spotless. I consider myself to be an expert in this area, as I used to work as a housekeeper at a hotel myself. I even checked the baseboards behind the beds - not a speck of dust! The housekeeping crew here is great. The bathroom was modern as well, with a huge showerhead, and the hot water came on right away with no wait. The towels were fresh and fluffy, seemed new as well. True, the neighborhood is pretty average - if you are on foot, you probably won't want to stay here - we didn't think it was much different from the other main streets in terms of crime etc, but there's not a lot around in the way of restaurants and such. If you have a rental car (recommended in Memphis anyway), no problem at all. Just a 5 minute drive down Madison Ave and there's drug stores, restuarants and more. The free breakfast was very satisfactory - they even have a waffle maker!!! I had a great waffle with maple syrup and some bottled juice while I read the paper in the cute and stylish dining area. The staff was great - friendly and helpful. My only criticism of the Gen X is they didn't have a box of tissues in the room - I wouldn't normally notice this, but I had a hayfever attack that day - springtime down south... We will defijnitely stay here again, I thought it was 4-star quality, and am recommending it to all my friends.",,,
donperico,312318,"I do not really understand the bad critics/photos. I stayed here with my parents just one night and we found a normal apartment with everything clean: bathroom, bedroom, living room and kitchen. The apartment was quite modern and nothing to see with the photos uploaded, it is a pity I do not take photos. I only had the possibility to see the apartment in which we stayed, so it seems likely that the most are not good. I stayed here with a friend of mine during two nights because we had a congress in Barcelona the next day. The room altough a little bit small were clean as well as the bathroom. Breakfast was OK and the location of the hotel was the best for us, very near from Diagonal street and to another interesting places in the city which we had the opportunity to visit. I would return here without doubt because it is value for the money and the location A very basic hotel that I only could recommend you only if you go there only to sleep. I stayed here during four nights in a travel with my family. We booked two rooms facing the street. This is rated as a 4 star hotel and in my opinion is a 3star very basic. 1. The recepcion staff: Just correct, nothing special. 2. The rooms: Really basic. The carpet did not look very clean... Beds and bathrooms just OK. We were not disturbed for the noise of the street during the night. For us was silent not as said in another reviews. 3. The breakfast: The first morning we arrived at 9.45 (breakfast is until 10 am) because we were really tired for the previous night as we arrived to the airport late and to the hotel at 2.30 am. That morning the waiters were taking away the breakfast so we just could eat some coffee and boiled eggs. We did not like this as it did left 15 minutes yet. Next mornings we were at ""normal"" hours at the breakfast room so we could enjoy the whole food. Bread rolls were delicious. 4. Location: Not very centric but near to a tram stop to arrive in five minutes to the Blue Mosque and Santa Sofia Mosque. If you are in a budget, or you are looking just an acommodation to sleep, this could work to you. Really basic hotel so do not expect any luxury.","I do not really understand the bad critics/photos.

I only had the possibility to see the apartment in which we stayed, so it seems likely that the most are not good. It is a budget apart hotel, but your money is worth more. The beds are terrible one could realy feel the mattress coils under a thin slice of foam. The air condition did not work and there was an instructions that it would operate only for a certain time during the day, tha means do not try it and during a terrible summer we had to let the windows open, but the street is very busy the whole night what made us really ""feel"" Madrid at night. The staff in the reception are not friendly, and speaks poor english. The only positive aspect is the distance from the subway station. Someone else booked this for me and I read all the negative reviews after I was already committed to going! I was pretty nervous obviously but need not have worried. Yes it is a bit basic but not a disgusting hole as some of the reviews say. Because other travelers have mentioned dirty carpets I have a feeling the apartments are already being upgraded since mine had a newish fake wood laminate hard floor. Pros: nice area (Goya) one of Madrid's better locations; close to everything such as shops and metro; CHEAP as 4 people can stay for 80-ish Euros a night I mean come on. Solid building with nice elevators, lovely marble corridors, and pretty secure with multiple locks and bolts on your door. Cons: mine was noisy due to facing onto busy main street, although double glazing works surprisingly well. Less well cleaned than typical hotel room. NB not implying it was filthy just a little bit tacky here and there. Internet access hopeless at 15 Euros per 24 hours who would pay that. It's true that the reception staff don't seem to speak English and don't bother with you much. This is not because they don't care it is because that's the way things are in Spain and they generally don't speak English much anywhere. The desk people are regular guys not the usual international ""have-a-nice-day"" customer service droids so you just have to go along with the concept that as you are in in the capital of Spain you might have to cope with a bit of Spanish. My stuttering phrasebook stuff was only one step above sign language but seemed to get me in OK. I am not the sort to put up with staying anywhere dodgy but I spent four days here and I was fine. The kitchen is good enough for simple meals and making coffee and the place is generally fairly cosy. I slept on the convertible sofa-bed (see photo) and both this and the real beds were comfortable if a little on the hard side. Apartamentos Goya is not a luxury hotel but it is a simple basic place to stay.",,,
Brenda C,283298,"The location is perfect, across from the Topkapi Palace and 2 blocks from the entrance to the Archeological Museum. The hotel is older and not elaborate, but safe, clean and has a wonderful staff, especially Burhan, who were willing to answer all our questions. We couldn't have been happier. We've stayed here several times in the past few years while attending The People's Choice Awards, MusiCares and the American Music Awards at the Nokia Theater, and the Convention Center - both are very close. The Grammy museum is just around the corner, and there are lots of great restaurants within 2 blocks of the hotel. The hotel is attached to the Ritz Carlton which has a wonderful spa and well equipped and immaculate work out facility. The rooms are clean, comfortable and have nice large bathrooms. They have all the ammenities, safe, coffee pot, robes, ironing board/iron etc. Although it is in the middle of a very busy area in terms of night life we found it quiet. The restaurant in the hotel has a wonderful breakfast buffet and there is a coffee shop in the hotel and a Starbucks just out the back door. We will definitely stay again. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful lady named Chi e ko on the phone and then so in person. She was very honest on the phone and gave any details we asked for about the resort. I felt like I knew her before we even arrived at the resort.My best friend(Debbie) and her husband wanted to stay at same resort and close to our cabin,and she made it happen for all of us, we stayed for 6 nights and were happy with everything at the resort.The cabins were well equipted and CLEAN,it was a 15 minute drive to stores for supplies, and 30 minutes to Branson strip.If you love quite,peacefull,well kept lawns,beautifull flowers,decorative pond with koi fish and relaxing sounds this is a great find, off the hustle of heavy traffic and right to shore access this is a great find.This is very kid friendly,lots of things to do,and hot tub,pool,and very helpfull staff. We will go back again,hope this is a great summer for Green Valley Resort!! We stayed two nights here. This hotel has a great location in the heart of Madrid on Gran Via. The famous Spanish department store is just a few meters walk from the hotel. Retiro Park and the Royal Palace are in walking distance as well as some really good restaurants. It is easy to acess the undergound line.They charge extra for breakfast so we decided to do it out of the hotel. The only negative comment that I can make is the size of the room, it was extremely small, but acceptable if you are on a city tour all day long. We visited Rome and other parts of Italy with family members and stayed at the Westin Excelsior. Our rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. We actually had a family room (like a living room) which adjoined two of our rooms which was wonderful. It gave us a place to meet, talk about our day and relax while skyping with family at home. The staff was very friendly and helpful. A great choice if you are in Rome. With in walking distance of Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain. We even walked from the Vatican back to the hotel (a longer walk). The restaurant was nice. If your breakfast is included that's great. If it's not included we found it a little pricey for our family. The fitness center was a big plus as well.

They have all the ammenities, safe, coffee pot, robes, ironing board/iron etc. Although it is in the middle of a very busy area in terms of night life we found it quiet. The restaurant in the hotel has a wonderful breakfast buffet and there is a coffee shop in the hotel and a Starbucks just out the back door. We will definitely stay again. My husband and i stayed Nov 5-8 2011 and couldnt have chosen a better hotel. Just a few steps from the trolley car line, the staff was wonderful, decor and history of the hotel is great, to boot, parking is minimal cost and continential breakfast is include. We have had many stays in New Orleans at top notch hotels and this one by far, surpassed the bigger hotels. Really enjoyed sitting out in the courtyard(s) with views of beautiful landscape and nice little pool. If you enjoy a evening cocktail, you'll need to bring your own or walk across the street for one. This was the most memoriable trip we have every had to New Orleans and we have are already started planning our next stay at this hotel. Duh - dumb blond mom moment. I booked it last minute on a Iphone app for last minute rates (which was a great price!) as we were driving through on our way to Colorado for Thanksgiving. The room was excellent and perfect for a few hours of sleep (great bed!). NOT a good idea for kids -- as there were pole dancers at the bar in the lobby (my girl pointed them out and said ""their BUNS are sticking out!!"" LoL!!). Also -- barf on the hallway floor the next morning and spilled french fries, empty beer bottles all over the hallway (we got up and on our way by 6am -- as we had a long drive) and obviously someone had a GREAT party the night before!! Oh well --- next time I'll know better. My bad!!","If you are expecting luxury, this is not the place for you. However, if you are on the lake boating and want a clean place to stay, this is the best bet for your money. We go to Table Rock at least once a year and have tried out many other resorts. Green Valley is the place where we keep coming back. It is clean, cool, comfortable and convenient. Last time we rented the 2 bedroom, 2 bath ""cabin"" and comfortably slept 6 adults. I have been on this resort for 4 days an will be staying another 6 days I am already planning my next trip.The owner her takes great pride in the comfort of her guest Something you dont see anymore we are here as a family an we have stayed in 3 units #1,11,an 14 all are clean an have the feeling of home attatched to them my husband an i arrived with our daughter an her boyfriend on Thursday with the rest of our family arriving on Sat my mother in law is in a wheel chair an the owner made a special effert to make sure all was set up for her arrival The grounds have all you could ask for hot tub ,pool,playground,basketball,volleyball, lots of lake front area which include boat docks an swim deck rental pontoons an paddle boat ..Beautiful veiws This is an older resort but for the money is worth every dollar. Grocery an Walmart is 7 miles away an 18 miles to Branson THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT TIME We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful lady named Chi e ko on the phone and then so in person. She was very honest on the phone and gave any details we asked for about the resort. I felt like I knew her before we even arrived at the resort.My best friend(Debbie) and her husband wanted to stay at same resort and close to our cabin,and she made it happen for all of us, we stayed for 6 nights and were happy with everything at the resort.The cabins were well equipted and CLEAN,it was a 15 minute drive to stores for supplies, and 30 minutes to Branson strip.If you love quite,peacefull,well kept lawns,beautifull flowers,decorative pond with koi fish and relaxing sounds this is a great find, off the hustle of heavy traffic and right to shore access this is a great find.This is very kid friendly,lots of things to do,and hot tub,pool,and very helpfull staff. We will go back again,hope this is a great summer for Green Valley Resort!! We were here on an extended family camp with our grandkids for three days. The owner was very helpful and accommodating. The facilities were excellent for our purposes. We especially liked the arrangement with the playground and pool near and in sight of our cabins. The kids loved rock hunting on the lake shore and playing in the pool. We also used the Resort's boat and tube for fun on the lake. The entrance road and interior roads were a little rough but the staff and pool soon had us forgetting about that. The beds seemed worn but slept well for me.",,,
Carlos_Barcelona,603610,"Was there on holidays for 2 nights. Hotel location is good and rooms, as typical in the US, are large and spacious. Booked a suite with two rooms as was travelling with my 2 children. Can't judge about breakfast as we find it a rip off unless you are really prepared to eat a lot. On the positive side, beds are comfortable. A couple of details have made me downgrade the hotel. Once arriving in a big van by the front parking area lobby (we were a group of 10), we were expecting help to enter lugage into the lobby. Expectations were a dream as we got no assistance at all. Once inside, the reservations made thru a travel agent could not be located by the clerks, so even that we thankfully had the rooms, check in was long and tedious. After a long translatlantic trip with young fellows, what one does not want is a problematic and long procedure to reach the room. To complicate things further, when I asked the reception for a US converter to plug my blackberry, they told me they did not have and all they had were for sale. Being an extensive traveller, I have never experienced such lack of customer care. I have seen both choices; either you leave a deposit and once the adapter is returned, the deposit is refunded or simply a ""here you are SIr"" and they expect the guest to return upon departure. In such a hotel category, I would expect that a belly boy brings it to the room. All in all, this hotel needs to review their customer service. For me, such ""small"" details can make a difference when returning to the area. I would probably stay somewhere else for the same price, expecting a more satisfactory experience. Stayed there for a business trip. Beds are very comfortable, breakfast ai all right, location is not too bad to be reasonable close to the center and to the airport (considering the lousy traffic in DF). Shame internet is not included in the rate and watch out if you have continental breakfast included in the rate as you may be offered a croissant and that surprisingly implies french fries (in the morning!), stuffed croissant with ham and cheese and increasing your bill.","Pros: - Concierge service - Comfortable beds - Good location if you need to be in the Pedregal area. Obviously very far from anything downtown (as much as 90 minutes in traffic) - Food at the two restaurants is pretty good if a bit overpriced Cons: - Some of the ads feature a pool but the hotel doesn't actually have a pool (they have converted it into a ballroom) - Only 1 of 3 treadmills in the gym was working on a regular basis - Hotel taxi service is extremely overpriced relative to the safe taxis that you can get at the sitio at the hospital behind the hotel. - Internet service is HORRIBLY overpriced considering that it is slow and cuts out frequently - Front desk service had questionable English and was not very helpful Stayed there for a business trip.

Shame internet is not included in the rate and watch out if you have continental breakfast included in the rate as you may be offered a croissant and that surprisingly implies french fries (in the morning!), stuffed croissant with ham and cheese and increasing your bill. I had to choose this hotel as it is next door to the hospital where we were to hospitalize a family member. I said we had to choose as I had seen the reviews and overall I was not looking forward to this stay...what an amazing surprise! From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with an honest smile. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and they ensured our room was assigned in line with our reservation requests. As we travel with kids, we always order additional towels when checking in, and it usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes to receive them if we are lucky. The moment we walked into our room we found the housekeeper placing additional towels...that is quick and efficient service. At all points of contact, every staff member kept asking us if we needed anything else so they could take immediate action. The room was extremely clean, I can say hospital-like clean. Comfortable and very cozy. The food ordered from room service was surprisingly good, served exactly as requested, at the right temperature and brought promptly by a very friendly staff member. Yes, the food is expensive (about CAD$4.00 for a can of soda), but you also pay for the convenience as the closest restaurant is about 1 mile away. I do not complain about these prices, as they are available for you to see before you order, so at the end it is your choice to take it or not. It was worthy and convenient for me and my family. Location is not the best if you do not have a car and if you are a tourist. However, after my previous horrible experience at NH Hotel in Mexico City, I strongly recommend Camino Real Pedregal as the perfect place to relax and enjoy a clean room with outstanding service. I stayed in this hotel on a trip sponsored by the government. For such a new hotel, the rooms seemed quite dirty. There were food smudges on the wall, and what looked like blood or some other dark matter smudged above the bathroom light switch. And there were many spills and stains on the floor. The bathroom sink had water stains on it, which suggested that it had been cleaned incompletely. Contrary to other reviews, I found the service quite friendly, if a bit inconsistent at times. Some services seemed incomplete--I never saw signs or indications of the pool that was advertised on the website, and the restaurant's prices were ridiculous. $35 for breakfast?? This isn't the Waldorf Astoria, and they could charge $15 and still keep out the riffraff. Good thing I was on an expense account. The hotel is in an extremely safe--but completely isolated and automobile dependent--part of town. I was lucky to have a driver, but if you don't you'll be spending lots of money on cabs, and will have to drive at least 30 minutes to go anywhere interesting. The nearest good night/dining spot is Charco de las Ranas (""croak of the frogs""). My hosts obviously wanted me to stay safe, but I would have traded some safety to be closer to the major sites. One other complaint is that the Internet speeds and connectivity were atrocious. I paid $12.95/day for internet (I had to go to the front desk to get a new password EVERY DAY), and I would lose my connection regularly. I almost asked for a refund. I'd bet it's the equivalent of a 128K ISDN connection. One positive rating: the beds were comfortable, and I slept quite well. I guess that's all that matters! We have stayed in other Camino Real hotels over the years and have found them to be very good. This time we spent 1 night and got a very good price (aproximately $140 US for 3 pax) through Expedia although the rate they have posted on reception is $400 US !!! They claim to be a 5 star hotel which is overstaing the truth by at least a star and a half . The room had large stains all over the carpet which immediately gave the impression of dirt and since the hotel is widely used by the Angeles Hospital next door we did not even want to think about what the stains might be. The bathroom only had ONE hand towel although we had paid a U.S $40 surcharge for our daughter to share the room. and nobody ever showed up to turn back the beds which had enough bedding on them for Alaska in December. Our main complaint was that the a/c did not work: Since it was up in the 90ÃÂ°s the a/c not working quickly became an issue and we called reception for help and they said they would send somebody from maintenance. We waited and waited and eventually fell asleep as we had driven for 5 hours and my daughter had got off a 14 hour flight. None of us slept for long and sweated it out all night. The ""courtesy"" coffee in the room cost $35 MXP and we were astonished on checking out to be charged a 10% service charge on the coffee that we ourselves had made. We refused to pay it on principle. We also called for the duty manager to complain about the a/c and he was completely did-interested and never bothered to apologise. It is a constant problem in Mexico that the customer is NEVER right. We will never, needless to say, stay in this hotel again and anybody wanting a hotel in the south of the city would be much better off at the Radisson Perisur.",,,
Lily53Ny,2515509,"We checked out yesterday after a week at Hotel Amsterdam-De Roode Leeuw. It was our first time in this city and we were so pleased with the location as well as the warm welcome we received. The room was very clean and comfortable on the 3rd floor where we received excellent service from the housekeeping staff. Indeed, we did have to squeegie the shower floor but just laughed it off as were on holiday and just assumed it was a ""European plumbing thing"". We were informed that the issue should be resolved by the time we come back. The staff at the desk were most pleasant and willing to help us with directions and information at all hours. The only time we experienced smoking odors was when we went to use the internet on the 1st floor (that is where the smoking rooms are). The lobby and the floor where we stayed had no odor of cigs. The room used for the internet is quiet and secure; however, I wished there was another computer I could have used because I did want to check my email from time to time to check on things from home and the area was often occupied (seemed like the same 2 people were always in there). Unfortunately we didn't get around to eating at the restaurant but we did get room service early one morning and we were very pleased with the freshness, choices, and amounts of food provided. Check- out was a breeze and we all had a great time chatting with the staff while we waited for our taxi to the airport. So long to Hotel Amsterdam! We really enjoyed our stay. See you all next year! Stayed this past week at Beach Cottages in cottage 512..on the beach.. and we loved it there. We heard good things from family who have stayed there in the past. The sunsets were awesome. We really enjoyed watching the surfers and dolphins... Very very clean, the beds are comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. Just a quick walk to Ralph's and Trader Joe's for some goodies and we were settled in in no time. Housekeeping stops by every day to see if you need anything. My only regret is that we rented a car for a week which we hardly used at all. We enjoyed hanging at the beach and took many long walks. The weather was in the 70's every day (they say we lucked out) People at the desk were very nice and went above and beyond one day to assist our guests from LA with a parking issue. The restaurant next door was great. We enjoyed our stay so much and look forward to returning in the future. The sooner the better!!!

The sooner the better!!!","My wife & I recently stayed at The Beach Cottages for two nights in the beginning of April. We rented a studio room with two queens, a small kitchen, & a partial view of the beach. The only complaint was that the beds were a little on the hard side, but other than that a great value for a beach location in pacific beach. I would stay at this place again anytime!!! My wife and I celebrated Valentines Day on Saturday by leaving the kids with the grandparents and coming down to the beach. We will often just head down to PB and wing-it, finding a room that day (as opposed to booking in advance). My wife had stayed at the Beach Cottages in the past but this was my first time here. All in all, not a bad hotel if you're looking for a beach front property. This hotel is old and shows it's age, but our room was fine. It was quite small but since it was just the two of us, it worked out perfectly. It also wasn't too pricey but it was off-season, so I'm sure it would have been twice as much during the summer months. We got a room on the 3rd floor in the main building and the view was spectacular. We were able to park for free in the hotel parking lot (a definite plus in PB) and walk to wherever we wanted. Because of the location, price, parking, and the view, we will definitely consider staying here again, especially for off-season visits to the beach.

The restaurant next door was great. We enjoyed our stay so much and look forward to returning in the future. The sooner the better!!! We were not happy with the hotel that we booked so we drove over to Pacific Beach, CA to look for a beachside hotel. This was Thanksgiving week so I wasn't sure we would be able to find something. Beach Cottages was able to give us a great room with a ocean view for a good price. Comfy beds. We stayed in the room for 3 days then switched to a beach side cottage.(also a great price) We loved being able to step out of our room and have our feet in the sand. The nights were chilly by the beach, so the heater was welcome. Next time we will eat out less and make use of the large cottage kitchen. The staff was really helpful. They have books, puzzles and games in the lobby to use. Very relaxed and funky area. I loved having a Bloody Mary beachside next door at the Green Flash. Looking forward to next year. If you are expecting the Ritz go somewhere else. But if you want a great fun location, clean rooms and old school California ambience, come here. We have been visiting for years and hesitate telling more people only because we want to keep it to ourselves. It is not fancy, no huge screen TVs, room service, etc. But what it does have is soul. You feel it the moment you arrive. Ping pong tables for the kids, outdoor grills for the whole family, laundry and walking distance to grocery stores (if your lucky enough to get a cabin that has a kitchen). And then, of course, there are clothing stores, surf shops and bike rentals if you are into that sort of thing. And then there is the beach and the boardwalk: directly in front of the place. Its busy and people watching central, so have fun with it! Make coffe in your room, or go get it at any of the number of really hip places around. Or pour some wine, then walk on the beach and let your cares melt away. All the while knowing your family is having fun too... The Beach Cottages is one of the best places to stay for families who want a San Diego beach vacation. We have stayed in both the cottages and motel rooms and have enjoyed both. Not having to fight for a parking space just to go to the beach is fantastic, the kids can run back to the room to use the restroom or get a snack, and, in the case of my husband, he can go back for a nap. A grocery store is nearby to pick up all the food you'll need for your stay. The Beach Cottages has several barbecues for grilling and patio tables to enjoy eating outside every night. If you're tired of the sand and water (but really, who would be?) they have ping pong and shuffleboard in the courtyard. Get your reservations in early in the year as they fill up fast. We stayed at here over 4th of July weekend. Great location, right on the beach - can't be beat. Older place, lots of families. The only downside was the noise noise noise. We were expecting this since we were right on the beach & during a holiday weekend but we were exhausted from lack of sleep by the end of our stay. If you have a family with children, this a a great place. Lots of other families, shuffle board, ping pong, grills, picnic tables etc... but if you're looking to get away w/ your significant other, this may not be the best place. We would consider staying here again if its possible to get a room on a quieter side of the property. The location is hard to pass up. This hotel is an older, refurbished building, with several off shoots to the main building. We had the misfortune of staying in an annex located in an alley surrounded by bars. It is a VERY busy and extremely noisey location. The room was older but large, slept 5 comfortably, but the beds were very hard and the carpet was filthy. The room had a nice size stocked kitchen with a bar and a large dining room table. There is no air conditioning, which I am very glad it was only in the high 60's cause it got pretty stuffy in the late afternoon, and you would not dare leave the sliding glass door open at night, as we were in an alley with all types of actvitiy, homeless people sleeping in the bushes, people smoking pot and lots of intoxicated individuals. The last night we had several people banging on our door at 3:30 in the am. The average age in this particular block was around 19 years old. It felt more like spring break in Rocky Point Mexico. On a positive note....the beach was just a very short block away, and you could see the waves from the balcany. I stayed 5 nights in a 3rd floor motel room that directly looked out onto the beach and cottage overtop the cottages. It was a superb view. The room was very nice although slightly on the small side. Some of the fixtures were older but still in good condition. The staff was very accomodating. The room had a refrigerator and microwave, and there is a Ralph's grocery store diaganally across the street. The beach out in front of the hotel and the neighborhood in general tends to draw a younger crowd. There is a place just down the ocean walk called Kono's that has a very good breakfast at a very good price (it also has a long line but is worth the wait). Overall very happy with the hotel. We rented one of the ocean front, 2-bedroom cottages (#513) for 2 nights and then switched to a non-oceanfront cottage (#519) for our third night since the oceanfront wasn't available. The first cottage was much smaller and older (worn wooden floors, older refrigerator) but had a great view of the ocean out of the front window. The second cottage had nice tiled floors and a larger updated kitchen, a larger living room and much larger bedrooms. The ocean was still visible out the livingroom window. My husband and I were travelling with our two young children and my mother and the oceanfront cottage was a bit cramped even though it can accommodate 6. If I had known the difference in the size of the places I would have chose to stay in the non-oceanfront, 2-bedroom cottage because of the extra space. Both places had a great patio/seating area outside the front door and easy access to the beach.",,,
pallinime,199400,"Fantastic hotel!! Great location, lovely modern rooms, friendly staff and perfect service. Very good breakfast and 5 o'clock tea. Strongly recommended Perfect location on Kurfurstendamm. Good service and friendly staff. Very big and comfort rooms with king-size bed (comfort double rooms). There's small kitchen in room #205. The best hotel for this price. Free bathrobe (ask at reception). Free Wi-fi in the room (ask login also at reception). Perfect location near Gran Via and Puerta del Sol. Quiet street in the city center. A lot of restaurants and shops near the hotel. Friendly staff. Nice rooms with free mini-bar and wi-fi. But there's no facilities for making tea/coffee. The only minus is breakfast!!! It's very poor but rathher expensive!!! If I come back I'll certainly stay here again. GREAT location! Close to everything you need. Nice hotel. Rooms are small but rather comfortable. The bed was perfect!! I lived in the second building (not main) and there was quiet enough. Breakfast isn't bad but very standard, nothing special. + A GREAT location in the heart of the city! Comfortable room with facilities for making tea/coffee. Breakfast is good, but there's no hot dishes (sausages, scrambled eggs, etc.) - Unhelpful and unfriendly staff Rather cold in the room","Service in this hotel is excellent with very attentive staff. Clean and very nice rooms in a very nice location of Berlin. I recommend this hotel. I was there for a trade show and will surely be there again next year. Perfect location on Kurfurstendamm. Good service and friendly staff. Very big and comfort rooms with king-size bed (comfort double rooms). There's small kitchen in room #205. The best hotel for this price. Free bathrobe (ask at reception). Free Wi-fi in the room (ask login also at reception). Stayed here for 4 nights - about 20-30 metres from the Kurfuerstendamm, and also from Uhlandstrasse U-bahn. The staff are efficient, rooms are quite large, clean and comfortable (I slept very well), there is free WiFi (but you may have to pop down to reception to get a signal) and rooms also have a safe for the laptop. What's not to like..? Well, not only the rooms, but... it's often excellent value, even compared to other Berlin hotel prices that are modest compared to many other places in Europe. Always on my shortlist if I'm visiting Berlin. Stayed here for 3 nights over New Years eve. Having read many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor I have to admit that my first reaction upon checking in to the hotel was one of disappointment. The professional photos of the hotel are very flattering. The staff on check-in were very efficient but not overly friendly. The room that we were allocated was a good size but was quite dated and stank of cigarettes. The bathroom was one of the biggest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean. Having got over the initial disappointment that the room was not quite as modern as we expected, we discovered that its saving grace was its location. Hecker's is the perfect location for exploring Berlin and while it is located in a very busy area it is extremely quiet. We had 3 days of exploring the city and 3 nights where we didn't hear a peep from anyone in the corridors or outside the hotel. This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel is within walking distance of some great restaurants and is close to both the tube and the overground train station. I would return to this hotel again for two reasons - it is wonderfully quiet which means you get a fantastic sleep and it is in the perfect location for exploring Berlin. Large and well equiped room -with little kitcchen off. Although the hotel is in a busy part of town the room was quiet and restful. We had a special deal of 3 for 2 nights. very good value compared to most European capitals. Stayed here for 3 nights on a short break. Hotel very convenient for all facilities and a 10 minute walk from the Christmas Market near the Zoological Garten railway station. Good size room, very comfortable bed, great breakfast. The hotel is located in a very central location and walking distance to shopping district. The rooms are very specious and welcoming. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The furniture in the room is out dated and shows signs of tear. If you are visiting during summer, you should watch out, as there is no AC unit in the room. The internet connection is very slow and sometimes you might have difficulty to download large files or your connection might fail. The hotel staffs are very friendly and hospitable. The Breakfast buffet was very well supplied with selection of cold cuts, variety of cheeses, freshly squeezed juice, pancakes, bacon, eggs, plus a huge selection of cereals, breads, yoghurts and jams. Overall, you do not need to book an expensive hotel and I really had a great stay. Large rooms, good facilities, helpful staff, great breakfast and next to lots of options for public transport (get a Berlin Welcome Card which gives you unlimited travel for the number of days you need). If you land at Tegel airport get the 109 bus from the terminal to a stop close to the hotel in KurfÃ¼rstendamm rather than going on the underground. That way you have no changing of lines dragging your suitcase up and down stairs. Order the Berlin Welcome Card beforehand and you can use it on this first trip. Activate it on the bus - we got a five day card and used it every day. the hotel is truly a gem - the location is very central & one can easily walk to many major attractions - public transportation is within a block The staff were all helpful, friendly and well informed. Our room was very spacious, very clean and included a seating and kitchen area. Unlike other properties we looked at the internet was readily available at no cost. I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there when I return to Berlin! Stayed here for four nights and the hotel exceeded my expectations. Bedrooms were larger than I expected and very clean, loads of towels and all fresh every day. Breakfast was very nice, everything you would expect of a Continental Breakfast and also eggs cooked to order, bacon and sausages, very good. The Hotel was in an excellent position with restaurants and bars in the area. My tip for a nice bar, turn left out of the hotel walk under the train bridge and on the left hand side are a few bars/restaurants. We liked the last bar on the right (near traffic lights), nice atmosphere and very reasonably priced for a drink. Reception staff very helpful and gave us some great advice on local travel! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Heckers! Lovely hotel, lovely (central'ish) location. Tidy, spacious room (we had the 'double comfort') with walk-in wardrobe, all the usual trimmings. However, there is no air-conditioning so if the weather is hot, as it was when we stayed last week, you need to keep the window/s open. And the street outside is really quite noisy, throughout the night. And please, pease, please when I ask for a 'double' room, give me a double bed, not two singles pushed together. Smart place though, extremely helpful staff, and a newspaper every morning, albeit in German which I don't speak. This small hotel is in a great area for shopping and dining. It is just off busy KurfÃ¼rstendamm, where the big department stores are and where most sightseeing buses stop, and also just a few pleasant blocks from the charming shops and cafes at Savignyplatz and its S-Bahn station. A friend stayed in an original room, and it was smaller than the newer ones, but decor is contemporary and bathrooms up to date throughout. Our very quiet Bauhaus Suite had two balconies, black-and-white-striped curtains and bedcover, light wood floors, walk-in closet with sliding barn-style glass doors, and two TVsâone in the white marble bath, complete with a remote to use while relaxing in the long, deep tub. A wonderful breakfast buffet is available each morning, but unfortunately it isn't included with all bookings. We stayed 3 nights at Hecker's Hotel and the location was great. Only a 2 minute walk to the U-bahn right on the KurfÃ¼rstendamm. The shopping around the hotel is fantastic on the Ku'damm and there's plenty of restaurants nearby. If you walk down the Ku'damm for about 10 minutes you walk right up to the GedÃ¤chtniskirche which is free to tour. I suggest getting to know the U-bahn your first day and it will get you everywhere you want to go and maximize your time so you aren't spending your whole day walking. The breakfast buffet was great. It included juices, coffee, bacon, eggs, sausages, cold meats, cheeses, yogurts, lots of bread choices, you can even make hand squeezed orange juice. One day it was raining and the hotel offered us free umbrellas. We used the business center to print and scan documents and the staff was very helpful. The service is great. Right across the street is a Sheckler's store. We stopped in here (closes at 7pm) to buy inexpensive bottle of wine, snacks, and toiletries. Much cheaper than using your hotel minibar. Rooms are large and internet was free! We were very pleased with our stay at the hotel. The location was close to public transportation, restaurants, and shopping. Our room was very clean, and had a great updated bathroom. It was huge, as well. However, the furnishings looked like they were about 10 years old. So if you care about appearances, it may bother you, but we thought it was just fine. The best part of the hotel was the service, and the hotel employees went above and beyond when we were having trouble connecting to their free wireless. Overall, a great value. We spent a week in April 2008 at HeckerÂ´s hotel. I thinkt that hotel was nice, good and big bathroom. Location was really great, especially for shopping!

Deborah C,2164805,"I had a lovely, comfortable room after a long traffic drive. I was disappointed to find that I had a shower only room, and I was hoping to take long awaited bubble bath. My treat while on business travel! Oh well, everything was fine. Breakfst in Trellises was also very good, I have even re-created one of their signature breakfast entrees for my family! Lovely room, convenient to my meeting, and delicious food! Great find after a long drive. I had a lovely, comfortable room after a long traffic drive.

We were welcomed and given lots of information which was very helpful. We were only 10 mins from the metro and shops which meant everything was accessible. Prior to our trip Katia answered all our questions and arranged our pick up to and from the airport which meant we did not have to worry about anything. Thank you. Excellent room, service and food. Concierge very helpful. Bar on 41 st floor with superb view of harbour. Pool not functioning when we stayed which was a bit annoying and the fire alarm went off at 2am but was a false alarm. Would revisit. Just back from a 2 night stay at Harrah's in the Mardi Gras Tower. We had 2 nites comped for a classic room--but we paid the $15 per nite for a Deluxe room with Queen pillow-top mattresses (very comfy!). Room was clean, comfortable--main complaints--poor water pressure for shower and dim lighting in bathroom--They could take down smaller flat-screen TV in bathroom and replace with a lighted make-up mirror ! Bathroom is too small for a TV anyway ! Casino was clean--NOT smokey--great selection of slots and table games--Carnival Court was always hopping--live music--cheap food ! Will stay there again--location can't be beat & easy to go over to Imperial Palace to Hash House A-Go-Go---which is a great place to eat !

I consider myself a fair reviewer and have a knack of finding the good in everything. The good in this is the location, it is in a close proximity to the West End and its walking distance to all theatres along with its extremely cheap prices (for London anyway) leaves it a good option if trying to do things on a tight low budget. We actually booked the Lonsdale on Bedford Place, but on arrival there we were told of problems with the hotel rooms and were redirected to the Gresham, we were shown our room, a twin, in the basement of the hotel, in stank, had no natural light and was next to the kitchens. No way!! we asked for another option so we were shown 2 singles next to each other on the 2nd floor, first thoughts were very basic student accomodation, cheap mattresses that you can feel every spring on and bedding fit for the police cells, TVs with not one watchable channel, and the noise was remarkable, all night long buses, lorries, police car sirens, revellers, bin wagons, needless to say I personally got no rest and just wanted to go home! I wish I had gone home or at least set off and found a good hotel outside London for half the price and got some sleep. This place could easily be a hostel for the social services, they seem to prey on visitors from overseas too (prices in Euros), once your there they have you! At least they show the room before completing the payment so you can walk if you want, my advice is walk! have a back up plan and go to it.

It is located at the end of a narrow street with no chance to park but the apartment offers us its private place to prk our car. We have welcomed by the owners, very very friendly, and they have given information and help to visit rome. The apartment is new, clean and equipped with everything you need for a holiday. The owners are building a sun deck with a wooden floor and gazebos that will be ready by the end of April. I strongly suggest this place. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to go on vacation in Rome. Traki This was a great apartment, we stayed for 3 nights. It was spacious, clean and had everything we needed.

Hi, from Nederland My 2 friends and I stayed for 4 nights in the beautiful LA PIAZZETTA apartment , 1 double and 1 twin very spacious and clean. We were greeted by the lovely Katia, who gave us a warm welcome and gave us plenty of information about the area i.e restaurants, shops metro. We were 10 mins walk to the metro which was only 3 stops to Rome. Also there was a very good book on Rome in the bookcase which we all found very useful. Massimo was also very helpful in arranging check-in time and also he booked private car to take us to the Airport on our departure. We all enjoyed the jacuzzii! I would highly recommend this apartment which is in a lovely quiet area and very convenient to all amenities. Sincerely. The apartment is very nice and clean, well furnished and spacious. It is close to via Aurelia, a very busy street but as it is at the end of a narrow street it is very silent. The bedsrooms and living room are big and bright. many shops in the area and we could get to the metro station just walking for 10 minutes. Excelente!",,,
mpmilestogo,562405,"I was returning from a week-long stay in India and wanted a place that would provide decent value, good prices, and had an interestikng location. The Gateway was all of those. There is also a really good BBQ place a short walk if you are into American BBQ with good cold beer choices. Check out http://www.smokeysbbq.com.sg/ for some great BBQ choices and its about .5 miles from the hotel. I only stayed one night but I enjoyed the neighborhood, walking around, and decent hotel conditions. The hotel is busy, bright, and has lots of people coming and going. I recommended the Gateway to another traveler looking for reasonable accommodations close to the Changi Airport as well. I stayed at the hotel a number of times on business travel. Enjoyed the hotel, its character, the hotel staff, the cold beer. The location is simply fantastic. Walking to malls, shopping, other restaurants is so easy. Thanks for a wonderful stay! I spent two weeks at the Harbourview and enjoyed it immensely. The location is nice to reach the bridge, tour around North Sydney, or just relax at the hotel. I had a free weekend and walked the bridge both days to see various places on my own. Hotel staff were very nice with recommendations for meals and places for beer! Enjoyed the stay immensely. Over the period of 2008 to 2010, I stayed repeatedly at the Changi Village on business travel both ending in Singapore and connecting on to India. I found the hotel to be very clean, the bar was decent, and the restaurant had pretty good food. My main issues with the hotel are the way that hotel wireless is managed outside of the room. One must purchase a coupon or ticket to even be wireless if in the bar or restaurant. This is a step backwards for most guests since most hotels extend wireless coverage for guests throughout the facilities. I strongly recommend that the hotel management reconsider this. Secondarily, many flights I had required me to depart on the 6am bus/shuttle. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is not open at 6am so I could not take advantage of the breakfast that my company had purchased or included. Strongly recommend management change this as well. Finally, the rooms are a bit too clean and impersonal to me. I would prefer some touches such as a softer or more personal touch to the rooms that would contribute to making them more personable. I love the area and the choices one has for food around the hotel and the hotel staff was very helpful. Thanks for a good place to stay on business travel. Consider the few issues I have raised to make a nice stay better.","I was returning from a week-long stay in India and wanted a place that would provide decent value, good prices, and had an interestikng location.

I recommended the Gateway to another traveler looking for reasonable accommodations close to the Changi Airport as well. this hotel could be a good value for money. Rooms are basic and small but they are OK. too noisy, inconsiderate clients. Doors banging, calling out to each other fromroom to room or down the hall at all times of the day and night. Have stayed twice and the same problem each time so i will not stay again Considering the rates of hotels in Singapore, this was a good value for money. Room was spacious. Though there was no window (it seems to be a problem with most hotels in Singapore). They do not serve breakfast and charge for internet access. My UMTS dongle did not work as my room was to the interior of the hotel. Being a vegetarian, I did not get too many options near the hotel for food. Hotel is a bit far from the center of the city. Getting to (Paya Lebar) MRT station would take around 10 min walk or around 5 SGD in a taxi. Overall worth staying if the duration of stay is not too long. Stayed for one night in September 2010. Good clean room, good location with loads of nearby good eateries. Cheapish although surcharges for 'event weekends' like formula 1 and $10 per hour for late checkouts with the only exception being if you check in after 3 am. Rooms basic, bathrooms small but OK. Air conditioning, limited cable TV service. Internet at a price The hotel was apparently located on the edge of a 'red light' district of Singapore but we didn't see anything unsavoury. We had booked a deluxe room but were given a small window-less one. The reception staff apologised and gave us the key to a better room which had a window overlooking a small green at the rear of the hotel. The room was okay if a little dated. The bedding was clean but the bathroom had a lot of mould on the tiles although the actual toilet, bath and basin were clean. There was a hot water shower over the bath. We were only there for three days so it was adequate for our needs. There is a 7/11 next door and a big supermarket across the road. The hotel is situated near both Paya Lebar and Eunos MRT stations. We walked the other way along Joo Chat road to the waterfront, which was lovely. If you are on a budget and want a simple, clean hotel in a handy location, then this is for you.",,,
shaunbsc,98021,"Stayed here 3/2012, booked thru priceline ($65 memphis east). Check in was very fast and smooth, which was appreciated. Room was very large and comfortable with a king bed. Big bathroom, very spacious. Place was clean, AC worked just fine as well. There is no fridge in the room, which was a surprise. Breakfast was good, but I had a problem with payment. They insisted on charging the meal to my room, but for my business expense purposed I need to pay for it on a company card. Their credit card system was not working so they charged it to my room, which I was not happy about. But, breakfast was good. A big turnoff is a large train that is located across the street. It came barreling through at 5am and was very loud and shook the entire room, waking me up. I've stayed at the Hyatt directly next door and did not have this issue so I probably won't stay here again. But that being said, this is a nice place and the value was good. Really not a bad deal for a hotel. I bid 65 at priceline and stayed for 2 nights, total cost after taxes, etc was about 170. Looks like the renovations are mostly done. My room was great, very big. King bed, sofa, desk, new tv, plenty of lighting, clean, but no micro/fridge. AC and cable worked well. Staff was friendly and place was pretty good. Awesome fitness center, compared to other places. Full dumbbell rack from 5lbs to 50lbs, 2 elipticals, 2 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 bench, tvs on all cardio equipment. Free parking as well, and real good breakfast. Onto the not so good... Internet was quite possibly slower than dial up, actually, much slower. It is a wired in-room ethernet connection, and it is plain bad. They say there is a ethostream wireless available but there is none. Very frustrating when trying to work. Location is not the best. Getting something to eat that isn't fast food, hot wings, or chinese is a 5+ mile drive. There were also several unsavory characters roaming the parking lot and smoking weed while sitting in cars at all hours of the night. I walked to the gas station across the street to get a gatorade around 10pm and the door was locked. You have to use a very small ""night window"" to purchase anything inside, and its basically a 6"" wide x 2"" deep drawer that the clerk slides out while she looks at you like you're mentally challenged. So if it's not a pack of cigarrettes your buying its not fitting in the drawer and you're out of luck. Had to drive to CVS a mile down the road. Breakfast is not free, which was a surprise. Its a very small hot buffet and I walked in to an unattended room and began helping myself, and after about 10 minutes a very chipper lady came in and asked me how everything was. Shortly after she dropped a bill on my table. Also, my room was not cleaned after my first night, completely untouched. That was strange. Otherwise, it was a pretty pleasant stay. It's probably an average deal considering the surrounding neighborhood. Think twice if you are a business traveler just because the internet is so bad, even in the business center. Otherwise, not a bad stay. Good amenities. Big fan of the fitness center. Not a horrible place to stay. Was reasonably close to the Memphis area. Seemed to be in an undesirable neighborhood. I was worried about leaving my vehicle in the parking lot because there were plenty of people loitering in the surrounding property at midnight when I went to the next door gas station for a drink. Room wasn't that bad. Had a hard time working the AC, but it got the job done. Internet was good. Room was semi clean, stains on carpets - but what hotel doesnt have that. Toilet was broken, and had to be adjusted after every flush to prevent it from running loudly all night - something they obviously encounter every time they clean the room, but never bother to fix. I was on the top floor to avoid any family noise/disturbance. This didn't seem to work. There were older kids going through the hallways at all hours. At one point around 10pm one of them actually knocked at my door only to say ""whoops wrong room"" and walk away when I answered. Breakfast was lousy. Standard continental breakfast with a waffle maker. Waffles were gross, tasted sour, like the batter had gone bad. Breakfast was also supposed to start at 6am, but when I went down to the area it was still being set up by the front desk worker and it wasn't ready til about 6:20. I also found out that my checkout receipt showed a double charge for the room. I had to speak with the manager to get the issue corrected and verified that my account would not be overcharged. Because of the hassles, I probably wouldn't stay here again. When I am business traveling I just want to relax and not worry about little things. It was a pain having to fix the toilet after every flush and play with the thermostat every 30 minutes to keep the room comfortable. I usually like to be out the door by 7am, so waiting for breakfast to be set up was also inconvenient. I also shouldn't have to worry about my credit card getting double charged or my vehicle being stolen/broken in to. In the future I'll spend the extra 20 and stay at the Wyndham.","Stayed here 3/2012, booked thru priceline ($65 memphis east). Check in was very fast and smooth, which was appreciated.

Great room, wonderful staff, good breakfast, but someone smoked in a neighboring room and ruined it. The staff handled my concerns as best they could, but they do need to find a way to better enforce their rules. I would like to see some posting from the hotel on how many guests complain of smoke, how many guests are fined for smoking, and what they do to clean up smokey rooms We stayed here on the way to Graceland. Many hotels near Graceland are overpriced. This one is not. It is about 20 minutes away and next door to a 4 star restaurant. Easy to find and plenty of rooms and parking. The hotel itself was very clean, very quiet (despite being next to the freeway), and luxorious compared to other hotels that are priced beloww 100.00 a night. Staff service was excellent as well. I would gladly stay here again. Use your AARP or AAA card for the best rate and enjoy a nice dinner and a great nights sleep. This was our first stay in a Courtyard Marriott property and it was very pleasant. The East/Park Avenue Courtyard is an older facility, but very clean, and our room was absolutely spotless. Although very small and decorated more in a minimalist style, our room was comfortable and the bed/pillows were first rate. Not much in the way of toiletries, no lotion included, and the coffee holder sported those one cup packages we really don't care for, but it was Royal Cup and tasty. The tub had a good safety bar--all hotels should--and that was appreciated. Our room rate included the breakfast buffet from the little restaurant in the lobby (scrambled eggs/cooked to order omelets, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits/gravy, fruit, pastries, oatmeal) and it was plentiful and good. Hostesses showed Marriott hospitality and served our coffee, juice in good mugs and glasses rather than the usual styrofoam. It was a pleasant change from the substandard fare most chains call a ""free"" breakfast. I would suggest salt/pepper shakers be wiped and refilled...ours were not, but the good breakfast was worth that little inconvenience. The breakfast area was light-filled, gas logs were lit and it was really a nice way to begin the day. Staff was friendly for the most part. We enjoyed this part of Memphis and there was a Target across the way for a quick dash to pick up needed items. Nice. The newer Courtyards may be a little more plush, but we enjoyed a quiet, stress-free stay and will likely come again. My room included a flat screen, king bed, small refrigerator, free wireless internet and balcony. I thought it was very clean and comfortable. I received a low price by bidding on the room so it was a great deal; still I would consider paying a higher price since it was nice and convenient. I was able to get an early check-in and they even accommodated my request for a room off of the ground floor. Highway entrance/exits are nearby as well as shops and restaurants. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay there again. Ethernet only in your room, so don't think of working in bed. Even with an Ethernet connection, bandwidth speed tests topping out at 47K. Useless for even receiving ""large"" email attachments (like a photo of your kid). Apple and Skype video conferencing both give up on the slow connection. Netflix made a sound that I swear was a chuckle before it told me my connection was insufficient. My company VPN keeps booting me off for lack of connection. Front desk says IBAHN offers ""upgrade"" for $3 - $5 PER HOUR! For the rates this hotel is charging, calling this ""free Internet"" should be false advertising! The hotel is in a good area with many dining choices nearby. The room was a bit small but clean and comfortable. I only heard the train once and it did not interrupt my sleep. Internet is free but not very fast. TV had HD channels which is nice. Overall, a good hotel for the price. I like this hotel. It is a good value and well located. The room was comfortable and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. But, I had to change rooms as the AC was not working. In the second room the toilet would not flush, some electrical outlets did not work, coffee was not replaced on the second morning, nor was the kleenex replaced. It does have wireless internet (wired) but that does not work on most modern devices. Breakfast was just OK. Still, it was a good value overall. The hotel was nice and clean, the breakfast was not great most stuff was cold and the service was lacking. the worst was that we got a room on the side of the hotel that had the train line across the way from it so at 4:30 am and again around 5:30am the train seemed to stop on the line outside for about a half hour it sounded like a very loud a/c unit maybe there was a problem on the line and we just were unlucky but it ruined our nights sleep The room was clean. However basic amenities like lotion had to be requested. Also, there were only two mirrors in the room and they were both in the same area. By the sink and closet. They offer a hot buffet breakfast but charged $10! So we went to the nearby La Quinta as we had friends staying there and enjoyed their free breakfast. We honestly didn't stay in the room much, but it was a large open room even with a king bed, sofa and large work space. The pool area was lovely and we had a room that opened right out by it. However the sauna/hot tub was out of order during our visit which seems to be an ongoing thing for us :( My husband checked in so I'm not sure about service but he was in and out quite quickly. It is next to a hospital so I did hear some ambulances and we did see the train go buy twice but neither of them were loud enough to wake us. Bed was very comfortable. It was a good deal for only $50 thru priceline. Would have been nice if they'd had some kind of contential breakfast though. Over it was a good hotel. Clean rooms and surroundings. We stayed 3 nights, free internet, good location, near restaurants, fairly quiet. I would return in the future. Pool and lobby was nice. I've stayed in many hotels and can say this hotel has management that cares about the service they provide. This is absolutely the worst Courtyard I've ever stayed at. I booked through Priceline and got a good rate, but that's the best thing about it. We stayed for two nights, on August 9th and 11th. (Spent the 10th in Arkansas.) Within two hours of checking in, we were bitten by ANTS in the BED! The front desk clerk came and saw the bugs but unfortunately couldn't give us another room since they were sold out. She was very nice and promised me that she'd report it and that I'd be compensated appropriately by the manager. When I came back on the 11th, I asked for to be put into another section of the hotel, which I was. I asked for an upgrade since I'd been promised to be taken care of upon my return. I was told that they were unable to do that because I'd paid through priceline *which isn't true. Priceline told me it was entirely up to the hotel. The next morning, I found a different type of bug. a COCKROACH. I asked the manager to come and see what I'd killed and she refused. I did have a housekeeper come and see it and this time I took a picture. The GM refused to take care of me in any way, shape or form. I was told that they'd be turning it into their insurance company and I'd be hearing from them. I still haven't heard a thing and have gotten no help whatsoever. RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN FROM THIS DUMP!!!",,,
FrancesLargs,229580,"Spent 5 enjoyable days at the Kleber Hotel,Paris, brilliant location. Could walk to all the significant land marks etc. which was a bonus. If travelling was necessary, public transport (metro, bus, airport bus) is right on the doorstep. Staff very friendly and informative. Breakfast was more than adequate, fresh and very tasty. We loved the informal nature of hotel. Bit disappointed in the lack of satellite service - especially for those evenings -after sight-seeing all day - when we had little energy left.

I spent one night in Hotel Kleber just because my friend advised me this hotel. It is located in central Paris with walking distance to Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. The hotel is very well decorated inside and you will the ""age"" of the building. Room was ok, suprisingly spacious and clean. However there was very unpleasant smell in the lift. Additionally there is very stupid way of closing room doors - key hole is located very close to door knob and you have to have very tiny hand to do it without pain! Bed was very comfortable and I had a room opposite to the street so it was very quiet in the night too. This hotel is conveniently located a 5 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe, with numerous cafes and restaurants nearby. The hotel reception is nicely decorated and the staff on reception very friendly and helpful. The bedroom and bathroom were tiny (like most are in Paris) but it was still charming. The surrounding streets were very quiet in the evening but the Kleber metro stop near the Arc de Triomphe is close by (as well as another metro stop) so it wasn't difficult to go across town. This hotel's most winning factor is it's fantastic location. 10 minute walk away from Champs-Elysees and the Eiffel Tower ! It is very cute inside, the decor is unusual but definitely gives the hotel some authentic French Character. The rooms are small but of a reasonbly good standard. After viewing a few rooms, we choose one on the street side as the view is much nicer and the street is very quiet so there was no traffic noise. The staff were friendly. The only downside was the breakfast. Tinned fruit salad ect. We only had breakfast one day, after that decided to search out nearby bakeries for a fresh croissant, much better! The price was good, we got an individual quote, which was much less than the rate on the website! (120 euros per night) so for this rate I thought it was great given its proximity to the centre. Having read some of the earlier, very critical reviews, it's clear that things have improved greatly at the Kleber. There's been a programme of renovation and the lift, for example, is now modern and works well. The hotel is situated in a relatively quiet side street, half way between two metro stations and close to bus stops. The Arc de Triomphe and the west end of the Champs-Elysees are nearby, less than ten minutes' walk. In the other direction, it's about a fifteen minute stroll to the banks of the Seine, at which point the Tour Eiffel is just across the river. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We mostly spoke (slightly rusty) French but they were just as happy to use English. The bedroom wasn't huge, but we didn't feel cramped. Like the rest of the hotel, it was nicely equipped with older and antique furniture. There was a large jacuzzi bath which had somehow been fitted into a fairly small but perfectly adequate bathroom. Although there were some minor signs of wear - scuffed paint here and there, for example - the room was clean. The free wifi worked well. There is an option to have breakfast in the hotel's breakfast room, in the basement, priced (when we stayed) at â¬14. We tried it on our first morning and had a good selection of cold meats, fresh and dried fruit, cheeses, boiled eggs, breads, cakes and croissants. However, we wanted to try a different place for breakfast each day and there are several cafÃ©s nearby. Le Corner CafÃ©, on the other side of Avenue Kleber and a little towards the south-west, did a cooked breakfast for about the same price, offering omelettes, scrambled eggs or oeufs au plat, which in this case meant no fewer than four fried eggs. We found other good places just a little farther away. We also enjoyed some very indulgent afternoon patisserie at a little tearoom almost directly across Av. Kleber and a little to the left. We would very happily return to the Kleber. It had everything we needed for a short break and the whole experience was very good indeed. It was nice to be greeted warmly and offered a room upgrade with a spa and balcony. The room was not large but very clean and most comfortable. The Reception staff were very helpful with suggestions on places to visit and directions to get there. Central to the major attractions and close to the rail was a big plus to walk easily around. There were plenty of restaurants, bars and convenience shopping close by. Short walk or long walk you would find what you are looking for. No hesitation staying there again as us Aussies have a saying ""if you are on to a good thing stick to it."" The Hotel was easy enough to find. Right in between 2 Metro stations. Very reasonable walking distance to L'Arc de Triumph, Eiffel & Champs Elysee. A few ok cafes, a few restaurants in little out of the way corners, a corner store, a supermarket and a very good Patisserie nearby but not a bustling centre which was fine as it made for quiet streets at night. We walked to the supermarket to buy water & fruit each night and over to the patisserie for a yummy brecky each morning. The A/C wasn't working but the weather was gorgeous so we got away with leaving the window open at night. The room we were in was smallish but fit a double bd, table, chair & minifridge. The bathroom was clean w/ roomy standup, no tub. Decor was very very pink & old French I suppose...a little worn but comfortable. The whole hotel only has a few floors with 3-4 rms per flr but they have a good elevator. The lobby is quaint with murals on the walls & again old style French furniture. Staff was fluent in English & very tolerant of our French. There were a few little misunderstandings (over borrowing an adapter & ordering a airport shuttle) but nothing very serious. They seemed knowledgeable enough & tolerant of our questions...though they didn't understand that we wanted to go to an open market or where to shop for deals that weren't at the glitzy malls. They had free wifi so we just googled it ourselves anyways & I think got better info. Overall it was alright...not 5 star but you don't pay for that so don't expect it. It was comfortable. Keep in mind that because its near the Arc that its at one end of the Champs Elysee...its quite the day hike to get to the Louvre. Might be nice to walk just the once so you can take in the sites & scenery but take the Metro the rest of the time & save your feet...sooo quick & easy to get everywhere with it. We got a fabulous deal at Â£70 a night. As such, felt the room was value for money particularly as we were using it as a pit stop. The rooms are not overly large but certainly comfortable for two people, and the bathroom was functional. One criticism is that the central staircase acted like an atrium and the acoustics of each level would travel all the way through the hotel. Location wise, the hotel is definitely on a great spot right between the Arch de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. Nearby bistros were a tad touristy by nature. We enjoyed our meals nonetheless. The metro was extremely easy to use and because of the summer holidays, there were no crowds. A very relaxing time of the year to go to Paris. Hotel Kleber is definitely deserved of its 3 star rating. Not sure if it's worth the 4 stars they claim they will be receiving though. the location of this 3* hotel is excellent (walking distance to Etoile, Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysee, etc) but the rooms are very small and somewhat ""cheesy"". Not sure why the Michelin Guide rates it as a ""red"" hotel. However, if you can get a ""deluxe"" room at around â¬105 per night including breakfast and taxes then it is exceptionally good value for such an expensive city.",,,
emileelouise92,654463,"I didn't really have any faults with the hotel. Check-In was quick and easy. We went in the pool which was nice and a farely adequate size. However, everyone sat at the bar can see which we both felt was a bit weird. Not far from the metro station uses metro line 12, easyily accessible once the metros mastered! Only complaint I would have is breakfast :-/ Not down to choice or anything but not to my tastes anyway. The rooms are an adequate size due to the amount of time spent in them which isn't much and the bathrooms were very clean. On cleanliness the maids were out each morning and let on. I enjoyed my stay at the oceania and would recommend to anyone :-) I absolutely loved this hotel. Upon arrival we believed we were going to get one of the rooms with a jacuzzi etc. However, our mistake booked the wrong one and they were easily able to put us in one of the other rooms with a jacuzzi :-) It pretty much made the trip, the room was beautiful, the staff were lovely, the breakfast was gorgeous.

It's much closer to the station than to the main attractions of Venice, but Venice is pretty small and you can walk everywhere (don't waste money on multi trip Vaporetto passes). You can easily walk with your luggage to the hotel from the station too. What a fantastic hotel and staff. From the time we arrived we were pampered and treated as stars. The junior suite we stayed number 6 was a truly Venetian Style, red covered bed, light under the bed, floor from the old ages very well preserved and overlooking to a small canal on the site. All facilities were great, wifi excellent, the jacuzzi fantastic, the bathroom huge. Very accessible, you take the waterbus number 1, to San Stae stop (the third stop) and then you go to the right of the museum up until you find the first turn left (big bridge to the left). You pass 4 bridges straight and you arrive at a square. Boom your hotel is on the right hand side. Very easy to find but people with heavy luggage might find it difficult to carry them but is a walk of no more than 5-7 minutes. Very close everything. We loved it. We were charged 20Ã¢âÂ¬/night for a baby bed. In all other hotels we stayd with our baby it was free of charge. Moreover, our room was on the ground floor. We regularly heard pumps (or another technical equipment) going on, night and day. The hotel is ideally located on a very quiet square, very nice district. The room was great, modern, calm, not very large but we did have enough space. We chose this hotel because of the design and the jacuzzi in the room, and we weren't disappointed. Staff is efficient and helpful. You can leave you luggage to enjoy your last day in the city. The breakfast was a little bit disappointing, but was OK. I absolutely loved this hotel. Upon arrival we believed we were going to get one of the rooms with a jacuzzi etc. However, our mistake booked the wrong one and they were easily able to put us in one of the other rooms with a jacuzzi :-) It pretty much made the trip, the room was beautiful, the staff were lovely, the breakfast was gorgeous.

tan c Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler,529337,what the terrible hotel ... i was stayed 3 night in urbis hotel ..no air condition no water heaters...very slow wifi like a turtle ..very disappointed! if u like have a nice trip in rome i dont recommended this hotel !is totally spoil ur mood Hotel is fine friendly staff the location ok( water bus 28euro for 48hour)only thing not good is hotel too warn,"This is hardly a hotel in the first place, not even a hostel. We had found out on arrival that we had to share bathroom with everyone on the floor, not only there was no hot or even warm water for the whole stay, the bathroom was dirty, rubish left in there for days, sink was leaking on the floor so it was always wet. On top of that , the light kept swiching off in the middle of having a shower and toilet paper was not always available. The room was smelly,no towels, no tv, but the receptionist was watching his loudly evenings and mornings, housekeeper completely ingnoring there is guests sleeping at 7am shouting at receptionist through corridor. Local families with no accomodation stay here monday till friday so kids in nappies are running up and down the corridor late at night and early mornings. There is no hair dryer or iron available so take your own if you can brave staying here in the first place! The location is great considering it is next to main train station but it smells of urine, people sleep on the door step and lots of questionable characters lurking. If you want to enjoy Rome stay anywhere but here! what the terrible hotel ... i was stayed 3 night in urbis hotel ..no air condition no water heaters...very slow wifi like a turtle ..very disappointed! if u like have a nice trip in rome i dont recommended this hotel !is totally spoil ur mood If you're on a budget, this is the perfect place. Just next to the central station (Roma Termini), you can easily get to everything in Rome. We had a great experience at the Urbis! Small compact room, about 18 inches to 2ft around bed and very small shower / toilet room. Shower rail was broken so nowhere for shower head to be placed. Extractor fan and not been cleaned in years. Behind the bathroom door was an array of body hair and a few bugs. Bedding was clean. Windows opened but the shutter on the outside was shut closed and covered in bird poop. Very little natural light. TV a small poratable CRT was 8ft off the ground and the wires dangled, buttons on the front were broken. No english speaking channels. Asked for 2 extra pillows and they could only supply one. Could be noisy at times at night mainly comming from inside the hotel. Staff helpful and friendly. Terminal for Train and Bus only 2 mins walk. Nearer the bottom end of hotels I have stayed but for a few nights it was ok i stayed in the hotel urbis for 4 nights at the start of May and i would plead with travelers thinking of spending their hard earned money, Dont do it. My first impressions were good, it was close to the main train station, Termini, easy enough to find, then the problems started. We were in the room closest to reception, we went out on our first full day there, seen the sights, came back to find that our room had been cleaned and anything of value had been stolen. We had an iphone which was well hidden at the bottom of a full suitcase inside a handbag, inside a zipped pocket stolen, but strangely the charger which was also in the same place was not. You will not believe what they said when we complained.. "" its not our fault WE employ romanian cleaners"" we argued for the rest of the trip with them but they then claimed not be able to understand english even though they had been speaking it the last 2 days. Bottom line for this hotel... way too expensive for what you pay for customer service non existant rude and abusive staff thieving cleaners ONLY STAY IN THIS HOTEL IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY AND LIKE TO LOSE YOUR POSSESIONS It was a very cheap hotel. We paid about 300 euro for the room for 7 nights. Located in the center of the city. The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter, Coloseum and other interesting ancient ruins and monuments are max 5 km from the hotel. The Marghera street is very noisy even after midnight. Our room was quite clean. The litter in our room was cleaned everyday. There was only one bathroom with toilet and shower on the floor, often busy. The towels we got were grey. TV and fan didn't work. Receptionist came to fix them. We got another fan but we could watch only one channel in TV. While watching TV screen turned black and white. Wi-Fi didn't work. On one day I founded two dead cockroaches in the bathroom. The shower's doors were broken. The worst - we left some money in our travel bag (about 50 euro). They simply dissapeard after the cleanig bedroom... Shame! I don't recommend this hotel.",,,
lkjhgZurich,659809,"berlin has so many hotels to choose from, very difficult to say where to stay. this place is a business hotel with a international crowd, many spanish visitors due to the chain's home. reception staff is extraordinary helpful, from airline web check in to giving directions to arranging a late breakfast. on the lower floor inner court rooms one feels a bit observed when the courtains are open, but the interior is new and modern. the website is absolutely misleading: it looks dull and not like a five star hotel. but once you get there, centrally located in the middle of kurfÃ¼rstendamm, you will be positively surprised. it has a nice, modern design with contemporary art, an international crowd, spacious rooms and very friendly staff. the fitness center is small but state of the art machines, the spa looked very inviting from the outside. during sunday breakfast it gest a bit crowded, but quality of food and service is very good. this is THE place in berlin for the international party crowd. brand new, cool mix of old and rotten berlin style mixed with modern high end elements. reception doesn't look like it but offers table tennis. the rooms vary in size depending on the category but all are nice for a weekend stay. the private viewing room in the basement is super comfy and the top floor bar with the terrace pool a killer.","the website is absolutely misleading: it looks dull and not like a five star hotel. but once you get there, centrally located in the middle of kurfÃ¼rstendamm, you will be positively surprised. it has a nice, modern design with contemporary art, an international crowd, spacious rooms and very friendly staff. the fitness center is small but state of the art machines, the spa looked very inviting from the outside. during sunday breakfast it gest a bit crowded, but quality of food and service is very good. Small hotel in Berlin Tempelhof - small room but pretty comfortable. The bathroom was standard, not anally clean but clean enough. Sheets changed every day. The breakfast was amazingly delicious. There's a subway station right across the street (Platz der LuftbrÃ¼cke). Cheap wi-fi 1 euro / hour and free parking in the back of the building. If you're on a budget , I do recommend this no-frills hotel. Very friendly staff. But keep in mind: this is not a luxurious hotel so don't raise your expectations too much! We paid 60 euros / night. Depending on which room you get, you might hear some traffic noise -- having the windows closed solves that problem, though. I don't know how it'd be in the summer, however. Stayed at Hotel Columbia for several nights. GOOD: friendly staff; good breakfast; shampoo and soap in the room; tea kettle with free tea, coffee, and bottled water in the room; free parking, relatively close to Berlin center; moderate prices; clean linen; a blow dryer in the room. BAD: the area is not nice (drunks, weird types around, unclean street); VERY noisy street (problem if you have to open the window in the summer); VERY small room (cannot open a large suitcase); the non-smoking room smells of smoke; VERY old plumblng (shower hard to adjust), VERY shabby and dusty carpets (look to be 20 + years old); VERY old and shabby towels; telephone is 2 euros per minute. Stayed here for one night when going to a concert at the Columbiahalle. The location close to the concert venue was the only reason I booked this hotel through bookings.com. It was very close to the underground station Platz de Luftbrucke and the area around the hotel seemed to be lots of official buildings. We arrived at the hotel and were asked to pay cash for the room before we were given the key. When we got to the room it smelled of smoke, but as we had already paid and the man on reception didn't speak much English we didn't ask for a change of room. We decided to go for a walk around the area which was quite quiet on a Saturday (probably because the office buildings were closed) and had asked where the nearest supermarket was - to be told 2km away. It wasn't and there was a Burger King next door. The bed was comfy, bed linen was clean and the all you can eat included breakfast was good. Unless I needed to be in that part of Berlin (i.e. walking distance of the Columbiahalle) , then I can't see a reason for staying at this hotel. For 49 Euros for the room including breakfast wasn't too bad value.",,,
gina s,1464893,"we were not looking to spend a lot of money on hotel and this hotel has great value for money :) although they were doing some renovation they went out of their way to make our stay as good as possible. and we got a room with newly renovated bathroom, very nice... otherwise the room was clean with comfortable bed, and breakfast normal for turkish standard. also there were a very nice reastaurant at the hotel with good food. a pluss for the hotel is definitely that the staff speak very good and fluently english the hotel is very central to a lot of attractions in walking distance and very easy to use public tranportation when you want to get around in the city. i think when we go back next year we will stay there again. Went the weekend after Fat Tuesday. Front desk people nice. Concierge was very helpful getting us into Commander's Palace, helping us with trolly route, which places not to miss in quarter. I never use the concierge but they were nice and helpful. Doormen great and nnot pushy. King suite was spacious and the furniture was beautiful. All was clean. Maid service comes later in day which was fine for us. We found the hotel to be quiet and other guests to be respectful. Loved the difft options for food and items in the attached restaurants, store, cafe. Loved the location -- a few blocks off the quarter on the other side of canal -- close enough to walk places but not RIGHT in the middle of bars. Only negative was a very rude worker at the cafe on our last morning. Tall, bigger guy with curly light brown hair. He was in a sour mood I guess. Just unpleasant, snappish; they had no plastic spoons and not willing to look for any. Sad because that was the last person we encountered before our departure.","The room was comfortable and the staff very helpful: every time I came in they offered me a cup of tea! The bathroom was basic, no shower recess, but clean. Excellent location in Sultanahmet, close to tram stop, Sirkeci (very convenient to travel to airport by tram (if you don't have too much luggage). Wi-fi in room. It was my first trip in Istanbul but not the last,it was so nice many different way.Two weeks with low budget and I'm so HAPPY that I find so nice Hotel than Hotel Emin,cosy and comfortable,lucky me!! Nice, warm and clean room,comfotable bed,good Turkish breakfast. The staff are super,all off them,from the reception to the kitchen.They made you feel so cosy. Good food, fantastic ""pillow bar"" as I call it,where you can relax and enjoy good Turkish tea or other beverage and also eat some nice food. The location of the hotel is great,close to Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, The Spice Market, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace.Tram stops are also very close,just few minutes walk. Me and my friend really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Really nice hotel, clean room, good food and very helpful and nice staff. Located in the centre, was possible to get by walk to every sighteseeng that was worth to see. If we ever go back to Istanbul again, we won't choose any other hotel for sure :-) Good value for money - hotel is situated in the very center of main attractions and all of them can be easily accessed from the Hotel. Public transports is at your door step and many good restaurants as well. Hotel is clean and staff is friendly. Try Restaurant special meal - worth every single EUR! If you don't want to spend too much money on hotel and you need it only for overnights - good choice. Emin hotel is a cute, inexpensive hotel in a phenomenal location. The rooms, though not huge, are functional and charming, and the bathrooms are nice and quite big. The staff are wonderful, both in the restaurant and in the reception, and always made us feel more than welcome. The food in the restaurant was also very good and inexpensive. The receptionist (Mehmet) spoke very good English and was very helpful whatever our needs. All in all, a great experience, and I'll be staying here again next time I come back to Istanbul. we were not looking to spend a lot of money on hotel and this hotel has great value for money :) although they were doing some renovation they went out of their way to make our stay as good as possible. and we got a room with newly renovated bathroom, very nice... otherwise the room was clean with comfortable bed, and breakfast normal for turkish standard. also there were a very nice reastaurant at the hotel with good food. a pluss for the hotel is definitely that the staff speak very good and fluently english the hotel is very central to a lot of attractions in walking distance and very easy to use public tranportation when you want to get around in the city. i think when we go back next year we will stay there again.",,,
Travel G,543477,"We booked an economy double room for two nights at less than thirty euro a night. Not right in the tourist area, but a 10 minute walk away or you can use the metro which is 20m away from the front door. Absolutely spotless rooms, very bright and modern. We worried the economy double would be too small but it was very roomy. If you don't mind some street noise, try and ask for a room looking over the street. They had already charged our credit card for two nights when we arrived, so make sure you show up or give ample notice of cancellations because they do things by the book. Only negative would be the water-saving spring taps in the bathroom were extremely annoying, but the bathrooms themselves were spotless. A quiet, clean stay and excellent value. The customer service at this hotel is absolutely outstanding! The breakfast was fantastic. The location is right the main train station (sants) and near to two metro stations. This compensates for being a way from the beach and main shopping/eating areas. There are small cares and some restaurants nearby though. The jacuzzi and sauna were great. The bar area was nice to relax in and we got cava on arrival. Also our wifi was free and worked in our room. Not sure if it is always free though or if that was part of the deal. The best thing above all were the staff, after being in France and getting the worst service ever we were so thankful for the staff here they made us comfortable and were helpful in everyway. Above what we would expect eg. Explaining where to go, which restaurants were great and how to get to the metro. This hotel was clean, the rooms were spacious, the staff were friendly, the breakfast was fresh and delicious and the location was unbeatable for the price. The entrance to the hotel is not traditional. You have to go down a very narrow alley way (about 1 meter wide or less!) and then up some stairs. The hotel is not signed well and yes it's true it is a small laminated sign but who cares what the outside looks like. The photos on here are accurate to what we stayed in. The reception is in the sister hotel just down the street. When you go down the alley then up the stairs the you press an intercom and talk to the reception who direct you where to go to check in. The check in is located in the hotel Antica Casa Carettoni. Remember this and you will love it. This hotel was definitely worth the money (a bargain!). There is not wifi but we were able to purchase some from the next door hotels wifi network hotspot on our credit card for 9 euro (shhhhhh!). There is however an Internet cafe just down the street as well as many restaurants and shops. The boat and train transport are a 1 minute walk away. Hotel room was spacious, clean and the balcony was large. The reception staff were very very helpful and would go out of their way to assist us. The hotel overall was modern and well equipped. Great location in the centre of everything many restaurants and shops nearby. The restaurant staff that served breakfast were rude, un helpful and not attentive. The breakfast was also nothing special for a 5 star hotel. 1 type of eggs that werent that fresh, bread and juice had run out both mornings and were not replenished. Took the staff half an hour to take our drink order also. Other than the restaurant I would stay again at this hotel it was lovely.","This hotel was clean, the rooms were spacious, the staff were friendly, the breakfast was fresh and delicious and the location was unbeatable for the price.

There is however an Internet cafe just down the street as well as many restaurants and shops. The boat and train transport are a 1 minute walk away. Having read previous reviews on this hotel, I was not looking forward to our 2 nights at Hotel Moderno (the funniest name ever!). Unfortunately there was not much choice in accommodation when we booked so we were stuck. Surprisingly I would have to say, for the only time in Italy, our very low expectations were exceeded! Apart from the check-in process, which was VERY painful with a heavy backpack at 10pm at night, we had no other complaints. Yes the rooms are small, yes it is an old building & yes it feels like you are on a ship. BUT the room was clean, bed was comfortable, aircon worked well, bathroom tidy and smelt clean, location is fantastic & was reasonably priced by Venice standards. TIP: For first-timers to Venice, we would strongly suggest staying on the mainland or a nearby island such as Lido, where you will still be 10 minutes from the action but get MUCH better value for money & less noise from the crowds. We were unpleasantly surprised when we arrived in Venice and found our hotel. The only 'sign' was a laminated sheet of paper with 'Hotel Moderno' and an arrow, stuck up with scotch tape around the edges. The arrow pointed you down a tiny creepy alley. We lugged our bags down there and went up the stairs, only to find out we had to check in at a sister hotel, a few doors down. Hotel and our room were pretty outdated, with carpet on the walls and doors, a couch that could have belonged to my grandmother as a child, and a stained bedspread that also sported a 6 inch gash in the middle of it! Once we stashed the bedspread in a drawer, the place seemed to be decently clean at least. If you can get over all that, it is a great location. In the middle of a lot of shopping and restaurants. Just a few minutes to walk to the train station or water busses. Also close to a great bridge over the grand canal. We stood at the top of that and watched boats and people go by while we ate some dinner a couple nights - which we'd picked up at Quanto Basta - a couple doors down from our hotel. They had pizza and awesome sandwiches with roasted meats and falafel! The other reviews say it all -- squeeze down a tiny alley, climb the stairs, to find a very basic but clean and functional room, in a convenient location. The Ritz it ain't. Checkin is next door, zero poetry, no service, but if you get it your room for 50 euros or under you are getting an OK deal. Having stayed recently at a fancer hotel in a ""better"" location (Rialto-San Marco), I would like to point out the advantages of the Moderno's location. You are next to the train station and the vaporetto hub, so that's all good. But I want to praise the neighborhood, Canareggio, which is a real neighborhood and not exclusively tourist oriented like Rialto-San Marco. There is an open air market on the Campo San Leonardo, a 5 minute walk away, and there are neighborhood bars where Venetian townspeople meet to shoot the breeze. The historic Jewish ghetto is a short walk away. Venetian food being generally mediocre and overpriced, you might consider taking at least some of your meals at the nearby Brek cafeteria, where the chow is no worse than elsewhere, but considerably cheaper. Consider all this as you book your room.",,,
coldcanuck,1825894,"Without a doubt the hotel has a lot of things going for it. The staff really can really make a stay enjoyable even in mediocre conditions. I must thank Ricardo especially for his kindness and help throughout our stay. They honestly seem to be trying to do some upgrades to the place but I can tell you honestly that dragging luggage up three flights of stairs is not my idea of fun but the one really bad part of the stay was we had a room where the toilet seat kept falling off its hinges.The furnishings were what I would call Spartan but we did not come to Rome to sit in our room. This was quite uncomfortable for a family with two teenage girls. Ricardo was a great host and recommended restaurants and helped me book reservations at the Vatican museum online. This hotel is almost perfectly located on a quieter side street in the center of Rome. Breakfast was enough to get your day started and the free wifi really was very reliable and simple to access. If you want luxury this is not the place for you...The value of this place is the location and its staff. When I booked this hotel I wondered why there were hardly any reviews since it opened in 2009 and I was a bit skeptical. No worries here, this hotel is quiet, cozy and well managed. It is actually two hotels one above the other managed by the same group. The attention to detail and comfort of our room was really evident after coming from a hotel in Rome that was a bit disappointing. I can also see how it would be hard to find but prior to our arrival we received an email with step by step directions and a pdf. map. Peter the owner quickly became a trusted friend doling out advice and humour. The european style breakfast was ample warm and fresh each morning. Wi-fi is included and simple to access. Clean well decorated and fairly spacious for Europe. Modern fixtures and Murano glass light fixtures. Thank you Peter !","This hotel was a pleasant surprise. It is a 2 star hotel and as you arrive you see why, the building is old and the breakfast area is small and with no decoration at all...BUT! as you enter your room you are surprise by a well decorated, clean and spacious room with comfortable beds and goos size bathroom. The AC worked perfect, the TV and the safe. What a value in a city where you feel you are being over charge on everything. It is quite easy to reach once you arrive to Venice with the information on it's location. BEWARE! We ran into a ""kind"" Viennese who offer to show us the way when we were 3 blocks from the hotel, once there I got ready to tip him and as I did he ask a whole lot more euros. This led to an argument that tainted the mood of arriving to one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I will return to this hotel again and again. Hotel Al Malcanton is an easy walk from the station and if you follow their instructions, it is not hard to find. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. After walking all over Venice, exploring the sights, we were pleased to have a room in a quiet hotel where a good night's sleep was ensured. This is a simple hotel but it met our needs in every way.

I stayed here with my family for 5 nights and it was a pleasant, Venetian experience. I arrived earlier than my family so they stored my luggage and I could take on the sites. I was able to get into the room right on time and rest for a bit. Each morning, the hotel serves a continental breakfast with warm croissants and made to order coffee or tea. It is a nice leisurely way to begin your day! The rooms themselves are huge and extremely clean. We stayed in a triple room which had one king sized bed and then a single bed. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and easy to use. They also provided soap and shampoo for our use and enough towels for 3 people. The staff each day cleaned the room, made the bed and ordered our towels. The highlight of this hotel is when I left I managed to leave my jewelry in the room. I didn't realize it, and thought I lost in route back to the USA. On the recommendation from my family I emailed the hotel to see by chance if I left it. They responded that after really searching they found it! It was a miracle to me! So, they sent it to me, FREE of charge back to the USA. I was so impressed with their concern and consideration of mailing it to me. I highly recommend this hotel to travelers in Venice. It is extremely, reasonably priced. The location is very convenient to the train station and bus station. It is also convenient to all the sites. We found it very easy to walk to and from. It is also on a quiet street, so even though you are on the ground level you don't have any noises. Their website is great and gives you a good view of the rooms and the breakfast. Enjoy!",,,

The hotel was completely booked the two nights we stayed, but we had no problems with noise at all. The hotel staff was friendly and we would definitely stay again, especially with the reasonable prices. I was very perplexed when we checked in here. We always go for Best Western due to a very exceptional experience in Houston. First, this is the first Best Western that doesn't have a typical hotel building (all rooms in a single building). I didn't know that it was formerly a Days Inn which we are also familiar of. That probably explains why we have to go out for the continental breakfast and why the walls are so thin. ACTUAL REVIEW: Price: cheap considering it is in a city. Location: very convenient to the places we wanted to visit. Cleanliness: Rooms are clean. Bathroom and bathtub are clean to soak in. Staff/ Service: They are courteous but nothing beats West Chase at Houston. Nobody went up and beyond to make sure we comfortable, not that they didn't take care of us. Just not superb. Rooms: The walls are thin. Our room is on the ground level and every step of the occupant upstairs are heard. I didn't sleep good due to this. Continental breakfast: Average menu plus a waffle maker. Safety: The area felt safe, it's the other guests that makes me nervous. They are very noisy in the middle of the night. TV/ Internet: Very average. Best Western is a good place but this isn't the best place to stay in Dallas. Got a great rate at this BW and it was only blocks from the next day's appointments. This is a recent remodel of an older hotel from another chain, but they've done a good job of it. Rooms are outside-entrance and are not as large as the new BWs, but good size and well equipped with above average micro, fridge, flat screen w/ good selection. Bed, pillows, towells were above average as well. Very friendly staff. Breakfast area is very small, but can grab a bite to go with no problem. Standard fare, but well presented and clean area. The restaurant adjoining the hotel parking lot was surprisingly good. No parking problems or undesirables noticed as mentioned by other reviewers. Will stay here again. Some way from the centre, and a very typical motel. The staff were freindly, and the reception area warm and comfortable. The room was large, and the wifi was OK, but it could definitely have been cleaner and had an odd musty smell. Good value, but on the whole I would rather not stay there again. Great value and location - only 15 mins walk to the McKinney trolley to get to downtown or 10 mins walk to the local metro station. Very friendly and helpful manager, Elizabeth Alfaro. The rooms were nicely furnished with everything we needed. Absolutely no complaints. It was brilliant for tourists like us who had no car. There's also a very nice cafe with excellent food located next door. We stayed for 6 nights and were very satisfied. Margaret McLoughlin and Michael Fitzpatrick London, England I attended the Solar Power conference in Oct 2011. The conference hotels were very expensive: $200+/day. Instead, I opted to stay at the Best Western Cityplace Inn, a modest little hotel about 4 miles from the convention center. The cost was less than a third of what I would have paid at the conference hotels! My first night was a bit rough, since my room was too close to the laundry machines. But the manager, Elizabeth, very kindly relocated me to a much quieter room. Overall, my stay was very comfortable. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The best thing are the staff, who are friendly and helpful, always greeting everyone with a smile. Summary: This hotel is strongly recommended, but avoid the rooms next to the laundry room! My husband and I were looking for a place to stay for one night after attending the State Fair of Texas. This was fairly close by (I think about 3 miles) and a great rate. We were exhausted after spending about ten hours at the fair. We were greeted with a very friendly girl at the front desk. We explained that we just wanted to grab a quick bite without traveling very far and hit the room! She told us of several places right on the other side of the highway, and there was a restaurant in on the other side of the parking lot that she recommended and supplied us with a menu. It was a bit pricey so we opted for going across the highway. We were pleased with our King room. It was clean and inviting. The bathroom was a bit small - it was fine for one night, but would get old after a week's stay. The only complaint I would have if any was the noise. We had a group next door to us that hung out outside the room chatting. Also a HUGE pickup truck right outside our door that cranked up at 5am and rattled the windows! The lobby area for breakfast was also very small. Just a few tables so if you don't time it right for breakfast, there is nowhere to sit. Overall, we were pleased with the friendliness of the staff, the location and the cleanliness of the room. Would definitely stay again for an overnight or couple night stay. Excellent value for the two nights I was in Dallas for training. The location was also perfect as I was only 3 miles away from the hospital where I was working. I scored a nice bargain through AAA for a king bed/sofa bed room which was plenty roomy enough for little ol' me. The sofa was a little worn but the room was clean and also had a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was the newest part as the tub and sink were all marble. I didn't use the pool so I can't comment on that, but I was pleasantly surprised at the fast wi-fi internet. The breakfast was slightly better than a continental one, but at least I got to fill up on eggs, sausages and toast before starting a long day. Staff were excellent as my card stopped working on the second day and they were very kind. Would stay here again. I was in Dallas for my granddaughter's high school graduation which was being held on the campus of SMU. The hotel was located only minutes away which made it ideal for me. From the moment I arrived, the manager, Elizabeth Alfaro, made me feel welcome. She quickly got me registered into a room and explained how every thing had recently been remodeled. When I saw the room and bath, I could not have been better pleased. Everything was clean and neat. Ms. Alfaro also told me that they had upgraded their free breakfast to include hot biscuits, gravy and eggs. This I tried on both mornings, and it was great. Perfect location if needing to stay close to financial district/uptown. Rooms are updated (granite countertops/tub walls) with nice decor. Lots of interior lighting in the room. Had in room safe, refrigerator and microwave. Parking lot well lit with security. No room for big trucks or trailers to park. Breakfast included (hot and ok selection). Very clean and well run hotel. Fantastic access to highway/main streets. Don't be fooled by the exterior appearance and surrounding shops. Two story hotel. This is a true super sleeper find!!! We stayed here for 3 nights when visiting uptown Dallas. As 3 young guys we wanted somewhere cheap, clean and comfortable which this was. Front desk staff were very helpul and nice. Rooms roomy and clean. Good location for uptown (short drive) as we couldnt afford to stay there. Would recommend to others I stayed at the Best Western City Place in Dallas and I was overcharged on my credit card for my stay. It's been over 3 weeks now and the manager is still giving me the run-around about crediting back my credit card for the overcharges. I've had to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General Office and the Better Business Bureau to get them to refund my money so I definitely would never recommend staying at this hotel. Bad people! My fiance and I stayed here one night, looking for a clean, resonably priced hotel, close to down town. The room was very clean. The front desk clerk was very friendly, and even recommended a place to eat and gave us directions. The beds were comfortable, and had no problems sleeping! Our group of 27 had an overnight stay here during a VERY busy (TX-OU football) weekend. Elizabeth Alfaro & her staff were most helpful making the reservations, having everything ready for us for an early check-in, & making everything run smoothly. Rooms were clean and comfortable, the place was quiet even though it was booked full. Convenient location & a great local restaurant next door. We were in town for our daughterÃ¢â¬â¢s college graduation and had 3 rooms booked. I was a little skeptical at first just driving by on the freeway..............it looked like an older hotel. Well, we all were pleasantly suprised. The staff at ck in were very nice. They accomodated us with all 3 rooms together. We spent 2 nights there, and would stay there again. Rooms were clean and very comfortable. The fridge was important to us and the free breakfast was very good! Free internet didn't work unless you were in the lobby. I had to get a contract done at the last minute so I had to sit in the lobby for an hour at 11 pm at night to get it done. The room was a room, nothing major. The parking lot had the occassional drifter walking through. I was happy to be on the second story where I felt more secure. If you have to stay near downtown, this site is inexpesive but I would probably find someplace else. Oh, and the road noise is a bother.",,,
Anthony H,567140,"The legacy was a very nice resort with plenty of things to do everything was very nice and clean and all the staff were very friendly and helpful . i will be returning for sure. The room was clean and tidy with the added bonus of an in room safe. Bathroom was tiny, but clean and sufficient. I would definitely recommend this for the budget conscious traveller. Good location close to the train station.","We stayed at Brando & Gio for the last three nights of our 50 day trip. We stayed in lots of hotels, most were better than this one. The staff was indifferent, I don't know if it was because they were rude, or just didn't understand English. Answers to our questions were short and curt. We had contact with them only during check in and check out. The room was small, but clean. The bathroom was adequate. We were in a non-smoking room, but the adjoining room apparently was smoking. The beds were small and very uncomfortable. Free internet. Positives: Ten minute walk to the main train terminal Very low price Elevator Free Internet Very Clean Good neighborhood - lots of restaurants nearby Negatives: Small room Small uncomfortable beds We decided that we would be out of the room most of the time, so we would sacrifice comfort for location and price. Luckily the weather was good, if it was raining, it would be tough to spend a lot of time in the room. If you are looking just for a place to sleep, this will fit the bill. The room wasnt the same that we booked so we had to pay 50euro to get our room,whatever we stayed 5 nights.No breakfast,the staff was not friendly AT ALL,i do not recomended The room was clean and tidy with the added bonus of an in room safe. Bathroom was tiny, but clean and sufficient. I would definitely recommend this for the budget conscious traveller. Good location close to the train station. Plenty of space with a comfy queen bed for me and a single for my travelling partner. Clean and air conditioned room, which was great as it was VERY hot! It looked like our room may have been recently refurbished. A tiny lift (that worked well). Ideally situated near Termini and walkable to some tourist spots. Good restaurants and bars nearby. Street not so noisy as others. I stayed at this hotel at the beginning and end of my time in Italy. It is located close to Roma Termini station which is great for travelling beyond Rome but it is a fair walking distance to all the other tourist sights. When I arrived the first time I was lead to a room which already had someone elses bag in it. It seemed they weren't sure where I should be. I ended up in a double room, near reception which was quite ok if not a little noisy at times. The beds were very hard but I found this to be common throughout Italy. The second visit I was in a single room which was very small but was quiet with a bathroom adequate for my needs. I really liked this hotel, very friendly staff and generally very clean. Didn't change the towels during our whole stay, but otherwise the room was cleaned reasonably well and bed made. Had air con in the room but the bathroom was rather small. Shower was a a bit weak. Breakfast was included and taken at a cafe further down the block, but was nothing to write home about and was just a coffee each and croissant. Price may not have been best value for money but it was overall and fine experience here. Very much a ""budget-hotel"" in a backstreet, so it wasnÂ´t so nice to be heading home much to late, but besides that very close by to the central station and good restaurant and a good supermarket (condeti). The room was ok, but in the bathroom we found some muld :-( and the staff wasnÂ´t so good at english, but they tryed to help us with directions when we asked on the map. The hotel was ok, but thatÂ´s it. The room was kind of small. This small hotel is very much aimed at the budget market.I went basic without breakfast.It was a five minuet walk from the rail station,and was located on the third floor of a large building.There is a lift so no problem.The staff speak English,and were friendly enough.There was one shower,but for some reason nobody seemed to use it.Maybe some rooms have their own?t they have free wi fi, but they were having problems with it while I was there.,..The room was clean,and I was surprised to find a safe in the room.There is also A TV.The location is great.In fact I walked everywhere without needing public transport,even to the Vatican.But I know not everyone wants to walk a lot,but there are plenty of buses running from the rail station Plenty of places to eat nearby,and a small supermarket at the end of the street. I stayed here for 4 nights on my own and couldn't have been happier with my stay. The rooms were exactly what I expected for the price I was paying, comparable to other hotels I've stayed at in Europe. My dealings with the desk staff, both day and night was very pleasant and courteous. They both spoke English and were encouraging when I attempted bits of Italian. The hotel was convenient for walking or transit to most sites in Rome. I could find no fault with this hotel. Would like to say we were very pleased with this hotel.....we arrived and were given keys for 2 rooms across the road in DiscoverRoma (a 5 room part of the Hotel chain).....We were worried as i'd read on here bad things about rooms over the road....but to our delight we were pleasantly surprised as the rooms were very nice, son had room at back of block with balcony and we were at front facing street (only bad thing was that workman were working on front of building, so scaffolding was there and bit noisy in the morning) but didn't bother us much as we're early rises. Room was cleaned everyday to high standard. It's an ideal base for seeing all the sights, very close to Termini station. On last day we could leave our bags there all day until our flight too. Couldn't fault this hotel and would go back no problem. HOTEL CASTELFIDARDO Via castelfidardo 31 00185 Rome We stayed there for three days and two nights. The place is very conveniently located near roma termini (main railway station) and we could walk down up to the hotel. The famous street via xxth century and beautiful Republica squire is very nearby. You can walk from the hotel to metro station, to get buses for any destination in and around Rome, and also to avail tram services. The hotel is on both sides of the road and some one should be there to guide you to the reception desk on one side, and rooms on the other side of the road. It has a very old and small lift enough to accommodate a couple with their luggage. The room was quite, airy, clean and specious, with tv, small fridge, and modern bath room. Towels were changed every day. it was value for money in Rome where the rate was only 85 euro per night on which were given 10% discount for cash payment. Morning breakfast (coffee and a bun) is included which is to be taken across the street in a cafÃ©. . We are thankful to our son and daughter in law in Milan who chose this hotel for us. We have booked a double standard room for three days in Rome. When we arrived we found out that the owner has two other hotels.Hotel lazzari and B&B Andu and Lu. He took us to Andy and Lu. The room was too small so it was the bathroom. The cover of the bed was dirty and so it was the quilt so we took the only blanket that it was kind of clean!! Walls were also dirty. The staff wasn't helpful at all. They manage to make our journey to Rome a disaster!!!!!!! we stayed in this hotel recently and found it very nice.rooms were very clean and basic.did the job as we didnt spend much time in the room.beds were made everyday and new towels too but there was no tv in our room. it can be noisy if u have people shouting in the hall way. the hotel is on the 3rd floor of a building but has a lift(very old lift but it does d job).i would stay here again as it was cheap and clean and also in a good area for transport and safety. we went in feb aand the weather was great also it was quiter for tourist to get around.markets daily near dis hotel.easy to get to from the termini station.",,,

I did not take their plastic ice bucket. I will never, never, never stay at Microtel Inns & Suites again. I am not a thief. I don't know how this hotel has a 3 out of 5 because this was honestly the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The carpets were badly stained with brown spots throughout our room and hallways, the towels had holes and felt more like sand paper (I would guess they have never been replaced), they didn't provide any amenities (not even shampoo), the bed quilt was older than I am and had multiple holes and looked like it has never been washed, and the heater didn't work so we were freezing all night. The location of the hotel is in the middle of corn fields and is by far the farthest hotel from the city of Champaign. DO NOT stay at this hotel!! I was worried about staying at this hotel because of the previous guys review-but the staff was nice to me. I stayed four nights, got a good rate. I was in town on business and used this hotel because it is a part of the frequent stay program I use. Wasnt in the room much but housekeeping did a good job. I would recommend hotel replace carpeting, improve breakfast. The only redeeming quality about this place was the service from the front desk. Both people I encountered were very friendly and helpful. My wife and I stayed here during University of Illinois' Homecoming Weekend. A time when all area hotels jack up their rates, but our two night stay at this place came out around $200. That is more expensive than their typical weekly rate. When we first walked in the room we felt we were camping in one of those little pop-up campers. The room was very small and cramped. The bed had thin sheets and blankets that were very scratchy and totally uncomfortable. The pillows were musty. The bath towels were small and very itchy. I would rather sleep in my car than this place ever again. t was snowing and icy and we wanted off the road quickly.. called from the car. It looked good from the outside.. soon as we got into the motel, I should have listened to the voice in my head to leave once I seen the plastic table cloth inside the door on a table with booklets on it... the ROOMS>> ARE HORRID.... dirty... beds are horrible!! Do not stay there. If I could leave a negative I would. We have stayed at this motel for the past 9 years and it is still as nice as it was the first timel. The location off the interstate is great and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. Small, Sparse, no laundry facilities and not welcoming. Bug crawling on door when we found our room (in the middle of cornfields so tried to put that out of my head). Uncomfortable beds, bedding and towels. No laundry facilities for soccer team, not fun. And after we are home I receive an extra charge with no call, for a broken bed frame. Don't know if we broke it, but would have appreciated a call. Wondering if the quality of the bed frame was the same quality as the rest of the Hotel. It appeared to me both beds were on the floor (very low) when we got there. But lesson learned, you pay for what you get and then you pay some more.",,,
pam018,623886,"We have stayed at Parrot Lagoon for several years up until last year! We always enjoyed it but last year it was horrible!!! We later found out that it was sold and not the same owners as before. Not only have the rates doubled, there were bugs galore, no carpeting on the floor which made it very slippery when coming in from the pool!!! We slipped several times on the floor, dirty bathrooms and not worth $1600.00 we paid for such a crappy condo!!! The so called crab feast never happened but the horrible bar-b-que was week old chicken and food we could not even eat!!! This was a real joke and we will not stay there again and am very upset to this day for the vacation we looked forward to was not a vacation at all, since we had to kill bugs constantly!!!!! The old owners were great, the new could care less and it's all about money to them, not a way to run a business. They should condemn this place!!!!!! This hotel was great and the people there were very accommodating and pleasant. The only problem we had was the mass amount of steps to the rooms! They should invest in elevators as I love this place but don't know if I would stay there again due to all those steps!! Great location and very convenient to the boardwalk, beach and anything you want!! Rooms were very clean and large!!","They seem to be really nice but watch out! when you first get there, they give you a paper to fill out with damages, make sure you inspect the house from floor to ceiling! we stayed here (parrot bay on 5th street, 2nd floor) and didnt get the deposit back (300.00) due to a TV CABLE not being pulled in - and we didnt even use the tv! they did follow with what they said about checking wrist bands, but once you made friends with the ""guard"" it was alright. the room we stayed in was nice, however i suggest you bring your own bedding x2. the sheets in BOTH double beds in our apartment had blood on them....can we say nasty?! and yes, i was a senior week renter, but our neighbors weren't - infact they lived there year round with a 3yr old daughter that they smoked weed in front of! they complained alot about noise too. One night, id say around 6 oour toilet got clogged and over flowed (do to puke) and they told us it wasnt their problem until the 11am the following morning. how nasty?! finally, We were late to return the key by literally 2 minutes, and they threatened to take out deposite money away. 2 minutes, really?! over all i will NEVER rent fro them again. the apartment appers to be nice, but it is FAR from it. never do it! i was there last year at the margarita ville condo i think u call it, itsnt there anymore in parrot lagooon website anymore, but let me tell u , wasnt wow but worth it, was very cheap, we enjoyed, we cooked, slept, relax, i think was good enough, now im looking to go there again, but im scared after all this comment, i dont want to have bad luck, Horrible black mold in room number 42, had me pull out my inhaller, had to leave in the morning, lungs full of congestion. 4 days later still sick and heading to doctor for treatment. Mold was not only all thru bathroom shower, but on the walls above the bed where we slept. did not look until morning when I could not breath, room dirty, old q-tips on floor. blood on mattress. gross place. we paid to stay for two nights and could not handle it. Not enough parking, had to park on street each night. advertised on space, but all 3 lots were filled. a very flithy dump, with office staff that could care less about anything except how they can justify charging more then what was advertised. left there full of bug bites after 2 nites! went up the road found a much better place for less. never again will i give these people a dime. This hotel was the nastiest hotel ever!!! It smelled like musty urine and left all our clothes damp. When i unpacked my clothes at home it felt/smelled like someone spilt old mildewed water in my suitcase!!!!!!! There were ants and bugs everywhere, crumbs on the floor, stains on the comforter! We left with bite marks from the bugs. When hotel employees were told first day about the ants they said someone would spray they never came. Next day we asked again, they said they would send someone, again no one came!!!!!!! Rusty fishing hooks held a set of our curtains together, lucky for them we didnt get stuck by them but only by a miracle! Thats def a safety hazard esp if their are kids around. No internet unless you pay $10 a day eventhough when you book they tell you it includes internet. Please take your money elsewhere, i wish we wouldve read these reviews before we booked our vacation. Oh and btw....before all this we had a mess up with our reservation with them also and went through a big hassle getting it resolved. NEVER EVER AGAIN, it kind of ruined our whole trip! I booked the ""extremely small room"" with 2 double beds in ""Ocean Lodge"" at the Parrot Lagoon Motel. The room was indeed small but it was just a place to sleep and shower at. Me and 3 friends stayed Saturday to Monday, for only $138 for the whole room.(plus tax...around 152 which is just about $40 per person!) The room was clean, as was the bathroom. They had maid service that gave us towels and took away the dirty ones. We chilled in here a couple of times, watched TV while eating pizza. Not bad at ALL. The Bathroom was tinier than expected and the door didn't lock, but we were brother,sister, boyfriend and friend, so it wasn't weird if anyone happened to walk in. lol It was pretty quiet too, except for the traffic outside. Didn't really hear any rowdy seniors there for beach week. ALSO, the beach was 2 blocks away!!!!! The staff was really nice and the parking was right next door. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone :) The weather was great and the Memorial Day weekend was a perfect getaway for my dad and I. Not everything turned out the way we planned though. We started our trip early wanting to beat traffic on Friday morning. Half a way on rt50 our tire blew. Let me tell you - certainly not a way to start your long weekend. After a long ride down there, we finally made it to OC and were greeted by smiley faces and a nice surprise. We had stayed here before and been satisfied enough to come back again, but I was really impressed by the changes that they had made. The room was very clean and nice. Our housekeeper kept us stocked for the weekend with fresh towels and we spent a good portion of our time at the outdoor pool. I am definitely going back this summer again.

vsylee,289863,"I frequent Singapore on business and have stayed in many hotels; however I must state that my 3-night stay at Studio M has been the worst. Upon arrival, I was pleased with the room design which is quite quirky and modern. The bathroom and toilets are small, but clean and worked reasonably well. However, as the stay progressed, I found that the front desk staff, housekeeping and operator were incapable of taking any instructions or messages (I am local, so this is not an issue with language or accent). A simple request like ""please send up extra toilet paper"" took 4 phone calls before it was executed. An order for room service almost went belly-up because they could not charge it to the room and needed me to provide the exact amount in cash. It is perplexing to get this low standard in a country like Singapore. Hidden behind unobtrusive doors between a shoe store and a cafe, lies the entrance to this boutique hotel. Rooms are named S, M, L, XL, XXL giving you a sense of the size you'll get with your booking. Ask for rooms facing the back if you want a quieter stay as the rooms at the front overlook Via Vittorio Veneto which is busy all day and through the night. Rooms are a decent size and neutrally decorated in a pleasing cream, white, black theme. I took the breakfast option at next door Cafe Strega, which was a great experience. I could choose from 4 different breakfast packages. Food wasn't blow-away, but it was fresh and a reasonable amount. Service at the hotel reception was professional, courteous and helpful. They quickly changed my room from M to L when I found that I couldn't sleep the first night due to the noise.","Everything about the Residenza A is terrific.

Excellent help from the two men working the front desk, good places to eat around especially Hosteria Romana....wonderfull dinner! Couldn't have asked for better, a pleasant surprise. Fantastic boutique hotel. We looked through lots of chinzy Roman hotels before we chose to book this one. It was a little more expensive but worth it. The room was very modern and clean, the hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly and gave us lots of useful hints and tips. The only downside is that you can hear (not too loudly) people in the other rooms and reception but not loud enough to keep you awake at night. On the whole, I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice, modern hotel in a fantastic location and dont want to pay premium prices. We stayed at The Residenza A in April (4 nights ) and we really had a great weekend in Rome. We were very impressed with this hotel! It was a very warm welcome after a very tiring travel. The staff were polite and helpful with good suggestions of restaurants, recommended bus routes and arranged airport transfers. Everything was very clean and modern design: we had the room ""ML"" with the nice via Veneto view. Breakfast was very good and served in the room or at Caffeâ Strega . The hotel offers free WiFi and internet with free access from pc in each room. We loved Rome and of course this very tidy and very nicely furnished Hotel Absolutely we will stay again at The Residenza A. Zsuzsanna Budapest Hungary It doesn't get any better staying on the Via Veneto and paying less than $300 per night! That includes breakfast at an upscale cafe right next door to the hotel. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. The room was stylish, comfortable and clean. We loved the hotel and will certainly stay here again when in Rome.. It was so well situated to all he sites. In addition the hotel arranged for a private transfer for us from the airport for slightly more than a taxi, which was much more comfortable than the hassle of a taxi. The Residenza A Boutique hotel truly stands out as being a top tier Boutique Art Hotel. We enjoyed our first stay in October 2009. During our visit to Rome in September 2010, we wanted to stay once again with Residenza A. As the same as our visit last year, Franesco was very kind and went out his way to make our stay truly grand! The location is great, and close to all the major sites. Via Vento is a beautiful area of the city to make your stay in. We always feel safe and secure at the hotel and area. The rooms are very up scale with all the modern decor. The Apple Computer in the room with free internet is nice to use. Great shower and beds. In the morning we enjoy a great breakfast downstairs at the Cafe Spaga. All this is included with your stay. The staff provides tours, and transportation at your request. Franesco carried our bags to our waiting car, just as he did last year. You will love Residenza A. This is our first choice when staying in Roma. You will the time of your life! Thank You to all the staff for making our stay once again amazing! At first hard to find as it is quite well hidden in what seems to be residents flats. Once found you go up some stairs and you are there in a quaint little hotel of around 10 rooms. Reception knew our names as we walked in and our room was ready. The room was an adequate size for the 2 of us and the Bulgari tolietries and the apple mac were a real nice touch. The room was clean, mini bar full and television working! Breakfast was in a nice little restaraunt a couple of doors down from the hotel and although the place looks nice the food was not great. We had a few days of cold toast and warm cereal! The only problems we experienced were that they lock the front door after a certain time and although you have a key it was difficult to open. In the end I had to ring the bell and the guy that came did not seem too best pleased. The only other problem was that our neighbours liked to shower at about 3 in the morning and you could hear them! And one last note to watch out for is that we used the hotels taxi service for our return journey to the airport which should have been a set price but the driver tried to get an extra 5 euros from us, which I refused to pay. I do not blame the hotel for this but the driver. All in all the hotel is on an OK location and we had a lovely stay with good service and a big smile nothing seemed like too much trouble for the staff and they helped with all our requests. Loved this place! Now realize that it is not a big hotel, not a 5 star luxury, but for the price and for the level it is EXCELLENT! The room is clean, modern, and reminded me a bit of a New York City pricey hotel. The bathroom is lovely. My room was the less expensive one XS which was actually very quiet and peaceful. The wood floors are very nice. The location is optimal, in a safe, nice neighborhood down the street from Harry's Bar, near the metro station, convenient to the taxi stand, good restaurants, Spanish Steps etc. The staff were VERY nice, helpful, arranged airport pick-up, dinner recommendations and the service was superb. I felt very comfortable and safe here and enjoyed the privacy of having my own key to come and go in the evenings. We had breakfast in the room one morning (very nice) and ate at the restaurant downstairs another day for breakfast. The computer in the room is very handy! I would highly recommend this boutique hotel if you are looking to spend less than 500 Euro a night and still stay at a very charming place. Staff was so very accomodating and responded very quickly to our emails prior to arrival. They offered to make us transportation arrangements from the airport and to the port in Civitavecchia and booked us with a FABULOUS tour agency for the Vatican. They were very accomodating in checking us in early from our red eye flight from USA (we were in Room ""L"") and also stored our luggage for us after check out so we could maximize our time at the Vatican. The street is tree-lined and quite with great restaurants. The Metro is only a short 5 minute walk and the park is practically in your backyard! We had a very early day at the Vatican and breakfast was delivered to our room exactly on time. Free internet was icing on the cake! We loved it. During the last Jubilee, Rome began to allow residential areas to turn their apartments into ""boutique"" hotels. The Italians call these places ""pensioners"" (or something like that), ie. they are not real hotels. This hotel falls into that category. It is a remodelled apartment on the first floor off Via Veneto. It is noisy (you can hear the traffic outside and the receptionist on the phone from your bedroom) and small. It is very nice and friendly and clean etc, and I still enjoy these smaller places to a large chain hotel, but I would not stay at this one again. Plus: Bulgari lotions and soaps in the bathroom. Found this by accident when checking reviews of another ""Residenza"" - some of the review comments are clearly mixed up. Glad we did anyway. This is really well-located: convenient for park, walking into main part of city, short walk to metro, away from the crowds. Just a small number of comfortable, clean rooms. The reception is 'manned' from 7am to 10pm and all of the staff were really friendly & helpful - arranging tickets, transport, and offering recommendations. Cafe Strega, next-door, is excellent for breakfast and evening meals - though there's no shortage of other good restaurants nearby. If you want an early start, you can get breakfast in your room from 7am.",,,
Kathi O,554230,"Me and my cousin stayed there in February for a few nights and it was a really great place! Rather central and well connected (one Metro station was almost right in front of the door and another one a 5-minute walk away so we could always chose from a great range of metro lines and get everywhere easily!)

If you need a cheap but quality hotel, pick the lux hotel! Me and my cousin stayed there in February for a few nights and it was a really great place!

I would definitely stay in this hotel again if I ever go back to Paris! This hotel is a very good value for Paris. It is right by the Picpus Metro stop which is the next to last stop on the M6 line. This makes it very convenient to get around the city quickly, and you want have to walk far after a long day. There are some pretty good restaurants in the area, such as Le Picotin, nearby for when you don't feel like travelling far. The service was nothing extraordinary, but it was also not lacking. The breakfast was always great, and there were a good number of people down there each morning. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to friends or family looking for an economical place to stay. Just returned from Paris, staying at this budget hotel for 2 nights. Chose this hotel after reading the previous reviews and I was certainly not disappointed. Daughter and I were given a very clean twin-bed room with bathroom attached on the 5th floor. The staff were friendly and helpful and we had a very pleasant stay. Will be back! I've stayed in Lux Pic Pus Nation hotel already 4x starting from 2001 and and the last was in 2007 and will be staying again soon in coming March. The hotel is clean and the bath room already renovated in 2005. The area is very nice near Nation. The metro station is just few steps from the hotel. It's true that you can still hear the break of the train from your room in 1st floor where I always prefer to stay coz I love to hear the sound from distance. The breakfast all you can eat with good quality. I considered the hotel is almost perfect for the rate. It's worth it for budget hotel. It's not far from center but it's not problem if you prefer in safe area and quiet. I mostly recommend traveller to stay but don't expect you would find good pillow. I love this hotel very much I stayed one night just passing through Paris, so can't comment on convenience to the major attractions, but the area is nice enough and it's a short taxi ride from Gare de Lyon. Reception, lift, stairs and bathrooms are all small, but hey, it's Paris! Nice views over the Boulevard too. Just make sure you're not on the seventh floor if you have lots of luggage; the lift only goes to the 6th! Overall, it's a good clean hotel with character at a great price. For the amount u paid in Paris , this place is definitely value for money . The location and service are good .. Just that my room is quite noisy maybe is at 1st floor and I can still hear the train passing by underground ! .A small hotel,clean and calm.All taxes,fees and breakfast included in quated price.Multi-languages spoken. Two hundred yards to 5 metro and 2 rer lines, one metro line across the street.The open air markets on wens & Saturday just around the corner.Book in advance they are always full. The hotel is a little removed from the regular tourist area but is well served by the Metro at Nation and Picpus (10-15 minutes to city 'centre'). Clean and comfortable with helpful staff and good local bistros without the inflated prices. Rooms are very small and the tiny shower cubicle resulted in me being wrapped up like a Roman Senator on his way to a toga party. We stayed on the second floor and the gentle subterranean rumble of the passing Metro trains was noticeable but not a problem. Nice breakfast with a good choice from the buffet but the dining room can get a little crowded. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good value budget room. Stayed 5 nights and was impressed with the excellent value for the price. Service was most helpful and friendly, all reception staff were able to speak English, and the desk is open 24 hours. Room was small but very clean, very comfortable bed, TV and spotless modern onsuite with shower . Could not ask for a better location. Metro station Picpus across the road, Nation Metro about a 10 minute walk and bus stop 50 meters away. Lots of restaurants, wine shops, cheese shops, patisseries, pub and supermarkets within short walking distance. If you'd like to see a bit of Paris streets, you can walk to Place de Bastille in about 45 minutes and may come accross interesting little shops and street markets with marvelous fresh produce, antiques, 'pre-loved' items of every kind, etc. I will certainly try to stay here again when in Paris! I'll start by saying the place was very clean, quiet, had a great bed and in a great location, you could be at the Louvre in 20 minutes as it's very close to the Nation Metro station. Lots of shops and restaurants with local flavours. The room was very small and the shower even smaller, 2'x2' at the most. I'm 6 ft and 220 lbs so it was difficult to maneuver around in there. There was a leak in the bathroom the entire time I was there, they wrapped a towel around the pipe and said they would call someone, I woke to a large puddle on the floor every morning. The power went off about 5 times in my 5 days. Breakfast was okay when you could get a seat, same selection of croissants and cheeses, it was fresh and the coffee was good. I opted to eat out in the mornings mostly, it was cheaper and you can always get a great sandwich at a local bakery. I didn't find them very knowledgeable about answering general tourist questions but there were a lot of flyers in the foyer to get you what you need. If you're on a budget, not too fussy and you're not too large of a person, this hotel will serve the purpose. Stayed 2 nights in Lux hotel, great location, right in the fun part of Paris and very near a central station (rer and metro nation). Very kind and helpfull staff. Rooms were not too big, but very cozy, very clean and quite fancy. The price is very reasonable for a nice hotel inside paris. I stayed for four nights there in May. My friend and I both like Lux hotel cause it's located in a quiet area and our room is big and comfortable, we had good night sleep. And the breakfast provided by the hotel were great too, the breakfast-attendant was nice and smiled all the time. I'll come back definitely! The hotel lies perfect, takes 1 minute to get to the metro (just across the street). We bought a metrocard that lasted for a week, cost around 70 euro for two persons. We could travel all around Paris (bus, train, metro), and even to Disneyland. The Hotel was VERY cheap, 36 Euro (2 persons, 1 week). Very nice staff! They have a breakfastbuffÃ© but we didn't tried it. The bathroom was very nice! There is a hairdryer but I recommend to take your own with you. Very nice neigbourhood, not much traffic or noise in the night. There is a little fridge (""minibar"") in the room, perfect if you buy your own water and want to keep it cold. Not very lagre rooms, but big enough for two persons. Recomend it to everyone! Stayed at the Lux Hotel for 7 nights in June with my wife and adult daughter. Room was small (as it should be) and very clean. Staff was warm and the neighborhood was very very French. Not a tourist destination and that is why we loved it! We were having trouble finding an affordable hotel for 3 in Paris until we found the Lux and we were glad we did. My wife thought the bed was better than the one at home. Breakfast was good and served until 10. Metro is very close with the RER just down the street. If you want a real Parisian experience stay here. If you want an American hotel, stay home. Also, if you are here on Saturday you MUST go to the open market on Vincennes street. This is Paris at it's best! We will stay here again. This hotel was very clean and comfortable and represented extraordinary value. Located very close to Picpus Metro station, it hasan elevator and 24 hour reception. Rooms are available with small refrigerators, televisions and telephones and are serviced daily. Breakfasts were excellent with a good variety of foods. We intend to make this our lodging on all future trips to Paris and have already recommended it to numerous friends.",,,
maria s,241011,"The W at Vieques is a beautiful retreat, the decor is amazing, modern but warm. We got there for lunch and the bad service began, we ordered an appetizer - they forgot about it, then we got our lunch except my daughters', we had to ask for it, they brought it after we finished our lunch and also brought the appetizer, a little late ! Ok they cover with a free round of drinks and they did not charge us the appetizer. We though ok, one time thing, NOT. The next day for breakfast we ordered coffee, a basket of breads and a fruit plate, half an hour to get bread and fruits, unacceptable for a $500.00 a night resort. The mix restaurant which advertises as a Alain Ducasse rest. the menu is non impressive and the food nothing exceptional. We stayed for two nights and all of our visits to the MIx were not pleasent, coffee no sugar, toast no butter Aghhhh it was really unpleasent to eat there. Poor service is the worst when you are in a gorgeous place paying a ridiculous amount of money for everything, from the hotel rate to the resort fee of $65 a night, plus the food, drinks etc. Management is definately to blame for the horrible service. I have made reservations with this hotel for october coming up and so far im in love with the place and staff already. Even though I was a pest and had soo many inquiries and talked Mr. Brian's Ear off he remained so sweet and courteous. From what ive delt with so far i cant wait for my vacation here!!! Ill definatley be posting my stay so stay tuned! :-)","I have made reservations with this hotel for october coming up and so far im in love with the place and staff already. Even though I was a pest and had soo many inquiries and talked Mr. Brian's Ear off he remained so sweet and courteous. From what ive delt with so far i cant wait for my vacation here!!! Ill definatley be posting my stay so stay tuned! :-) The rooms are dirty: The maids do not do their job and leave a note asking for a tip. The first night we stayed I pulled back the comforter and the sheets had sand in them which made me think they did't even wash them. There are two trash cans in the room. The maids emptied one and just moved the other one. Even worse, there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Half of the employees don't speak english (I say they just don't want to deal with problems). We reserved a smoking room and didn't have an ash tray, after asking for one it took them over thirty minuets to find one for our room. The internet didn't work in our room so we went to the front desk and asked Brian what to do about this. He told us to go across the parking lot and sit on a bench outside of someone else's room. My daughter and I wanted to stay on the beach in April and the prices were reasonable. Reviews stated clean and no bed bugs so we took our chances. First of all, when we arrived the credit card machine messed up and we were stuck in the office for 30 minutes while the desk clerk waited for the owner to assist with the machine. The owner treated his employee like he was an idiot for not knowing how to fix it. However, the clerk was nice enough to give us a room closer to the pool for our ""inconvenience"". A couple of days after returning home, I was looking over my statement online and noticed that the hotel had charged us twice for our stay. I called the hotel immediately and the man that answered the phone said he had to take his daughter to school and would call me back. No call back that day. Called my bank and they have credited the charge while it is investigated. Called the hotel back and was by clerk that all I had to do was fax a copy of my statement showing the double charge. Faxed the copy to them and received a call back from the owner stating they would not reimburse because there is a credit on my statement. I explained that the credit is from my bank because I disputed the charges and per the bank rep he would need to repay the bank as he's been paid twice. He refused to reverse my charges stating that the bank already took the money from him. I gave up and decided to let the bank fight it out with him. He will have to repay as he only has one receipt signed by me. I will NEVER stay here again. Do yourself a favor...pay a little extra to avoid the trouble. If I knew I was going to double pay, I could have stayed at the Hilton! I stayed overnight with my husband and my 11 yr old brother. The place is really cozy and the staff was really friendly. If you are expecting the Hilton, then check in at the Hilton; it is a great place for the price you pay. :o) I am a Value Club member of ABVI, so when I saw this hotel advertised, I selected it over other comparable hotels. First, when I arrived, the actual price I paid for a three day stay was a little more than was quoted online. The front desk manager offered to upgrade me..for a significant increase in price. (I thought as a member I could get a better deal than what was offered.) The room we got, while clean, was near the road and had NOWHERE to hang clothes that were on a hanger except right under the TV stand. Even though it was a non-smoking room, there was a musty smell when we first arrived and the only blanket was the comforter on top of the bed. (This had a hole in it). We did have some difficulty with noisy neighbors, but given it was over New Year's, I'll discount that. Most ABVIs have breakfast--this one does not. The parking is difficult to maneuver out of. Our room key demagnetized one day early(!). (Trying to tell us something?) To top it all off, we had asked the front desk clerk early on in our stay if we could have a 12:00 check out. He said no problem, ""at no extra charge"" We were surprised, when we received a knock at 11:00 from someone asking us if we were leaving or were staying another day. He was surprised when we told him of the arrangement. I only give this a 3 star because the hotel is on the beach, the room was clean when we got there (although our bed was never made over a three day stay) and there is a nice lounge area near the pool. There are too many hotels in Daytona Beach, though, to recommend this one. I booked a single no-smoking room with king bed for 2 nights over the internet. The price was quite reasonable: $119 for two nights including 12.5% tax. I did notice, however, when I arrived that the sign in front of the hotel said ""all singles $35. a night"". I checked in and went right to my room. It was a large single room with tiled flooring. It was very clean, but had a very musty smell. There were 2 tiny cakes of soap in the bathroom and no shampoo. One of the 2 lights by the bed did not work. The room had an older tv, but was in good working order with a large number of channels from which to choose. Aside from the lingering odor, the room was ok.....and $119 for two nights is a bargain these days. Besides, the motel was directly on the beach and was attractive on the outside. My 2nd night was a nitemare! No fault of the motel, directly anyway. It seems they registered a large group of people around midnight. For a good 2 hours, these people hollered back and forth. The ones in the room above me made one heck of a racket all that time. One of their car alarms (just outside my room) went off 4 times. That led me to believe they were breaking into cars. They were not, however. Just wandering around the parking lot and making a lot of noise. My second day, I decided to ask why I was not charged $35/nite. I was told that price was for just a few rooms that I definitely would not want to stay in. He even told me he would show me those rooms to prove that I wouldn't want them! Anyway, for a room in a motel directly on the beach....the price is right. Barebones, clean but smelly. My wife and I stayed here for 1 night 4/16/11. The manager told me that this was once a Red Carpet Inn. He also stated that they have spent a lot of money to refurbish the motel. The outside show the improvements; however, there's only so much that can be done to a 1960's motel room. We were placed in a kitchenette room (didn't ask for one), which was okay. The room although dated, and with no frills, was quiet, and comfortable with no bugs. Considering location and price, this was not a bad place to stay for a night or two. Being a couple that is expecting a baby in July, we were looking to take a nice vacation during Spring Break but we were not looking for the extreme prices that usually come with that. Which was why we were surprised to find a beach side hotel at such a cheap rate. We paid $53.10 per night for five nights. Upon arriving, I was not expecting a 5 star hotel but I was expecting a slightly cleaner room than we received. First off, the gentleman in the office did not even bother to check my reservation, and he almost gave us the wrong type of room. I had to remind him that we needed a king size bed rather than two twin beds. After that, upon entering our room, we found small black bugs all in the window of the room behind the curtain. They were only in this area of the room and after killing them all, we have not had any other issues with this. We assume someone left the door open and the bugs were able to get in. Other than that small issue, the room was fine. Being right next to the beach was an awesome feature and the pool is also very well kept up and clean. If you are looking for a cheap beach side hotel and are okay with having just that, then this hotel will be perfect for you. I was recently in Daytona Beach and decided to check out this hotel while driving by. The rooms were 49.00 a nite so we stayed for two nites. I was kind of scared when opening the door to the room, but was pleasantly surprised. The rooms must of been recently remodeled because there was no carpet in the rooms, it was new flooring. The beds were new and very comfortable as well as the bedding. The bathroom had a new shower and sink and flooring. You could tell they recently did some renovations. They are not the best renovations but the rooms were clean. There was some odd odor but it was tolerable. Nice view of the beach and very close by. The front desk was very helpful and also gave a care package with razors and lotions and body wash etc.......Don't let the reviews scare you away.",,,
tinman3,294929,"No real complaints here regarding the hotel and room, and based on previous stays in Istanbul I think this is a great value place. One special feature of this place are all the wonderful carpets and kilims in our room and throughout the hotel. My wife has a preference for tile and wood floors, so enjoyed our room for this. Our bathroom was very basic and though large was rather depressing so the only negative (also after a very rainy day, nothing left in the bathroom was dry in the morning). We had a triple room that had two TV's, didn't use them but our son was excited to have his own options. The breakfast room was fantastic for the view and the food. Service was excellent from lobby to terrace and we would not hesitate to stay here again. The location is great, and though we were next to a somewhat busy one-way street road noise was minimal and not a bother at all....easy walk to the Grand Bazaar, Arrasta Bazaar, and the rest of Sultanahmet. Not a great experience. Location was great and we slept all right, but had to ask for almost everything (towels, soap, linens!), and breakfast was really horrid. For our 10-day tour we almost had a crisis with the tour operator since this was our first hotel of the stay in Turkey and we were very worried that the rest of the hotels would be like this.

We were upgraded to an excellent room beyond our expectations with a view to the Blue Mosque on one side, Aya Sofia through the trees on the other, and a peaceful courtyard with a fountain below. Breakfast was fine with everything we would care for in a continental buffet. Location was perfect in Sultanahmet, with a short walk to the main sites just around the corner but tucked into a very quiet tourist area with plenty of shops to choose from nearby. At the end of the stay my son forgot his stuffed dog in the room, and the staff had no problem to send it to us at no charge, no complaints. We are living in Cairo so hope to get back to Istanbul soon, and will definitely try to stay here again.","No real complaints here regarding the hotel and room, and based on previous stays in Istanbul I think this is a great value place.

We stayed 6 nights the last week in September and when we arrived and opened the door to our room we were extremely happy with our choice for Istanbul. The location couldn't be better. You are steps from the Hippodrome and its surrounding sites plus walking distance to anywhere in Sultanhamet. From check in to check out and everything in between, the staff were friendly, professional and most helpful when we required it. I booked a ""deluxe"" category room directly with the hotel via e-mail. On arrival, reception provided us with a map and guidance about the sites. Our room was charming, spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and I comment because when staying 6 nights you very much hope for a comfortable mattress. Breakfast is served on the rooftop by two very efficient and professional men. I repeat myself when I'm happy with a hotel and reviewing by saying a ""hotel is only as good as its management and staff"" and it is so true. The breakfast provided boiled eggs, cheeses, tomatoes, cucumbers, meats, scrambled eggs, cereal, ""delicious"" fresh bread, yogurt and honey and more. The rooftop is a very enjoyable start to your day. We loved Hotel Fehmi Bey and would definitely return to this hotel. Thank you to the staff for helping to make our first visit to Istanbul so enjoyable. I have stayed in this hotel on many occasions and love the central location and the staff. It is a family run place which is much warmer and more personal than chain hotels. Staff remembered me from one stay to the next and were really helpful if I had problems locating an address or reading something in Turkish. Great value for the money. Just minutes from all Sultanahmet area attractions. Breakfast on the roof has a fabulous view of the Marmara and the Blue Mosque. We found Fehmi Bey at the Internet, as we were searching for a cheepish hotel in Sultan Ahmed with a good roof terrace. And we were not disapointed. The hotel has a family feel to it. The staff in the reception were always helpful, and the room was kept clean and tidy. We stayed in the family appartement on the 1:st floor. No particular view, and rather boring with nothing on the walls. However, this was compensated by the spacious bed rooms and, in particular, the wast living room. Great for kids running around. The location close to the ancient Hipodrome and the Blue Mosque is perfect, with spectacular views of the mosque, Haga Sofia, and the Bosphorus from the roof terrace. The terrace is a lovely place to spend a lot of time, reading or enjoying the hotel's excellent breakfast. It was 1st time for us to visit Istanbul and we stayed 3 nights at Fehmi Bey. Very nice location and most of sightseeing spots are within walking distance. Blue mosque, Hagia Sphia, Topkapi Place, Grand Bazaar, etc. We stayed standard room but I could see Blue mosque in front and it was very beautiful especially in the evening it gets illuminated. And the view from their roof terrace was just gourgious... If you are morning person, you can take a quiet walk around Blue mosque area before it crowded by tourists. Hotel staffs are always kind and nice. I would like to stay their hotel again for next visit. Fehmi Bey is just round the corner from the Hippodrome and the azure mosque with a top covering peak morning meal terrace that overlooks the ocean of Marama and the azure mosque. Rooms are well conceived with up to date bathrooms. The staff is just fine directed by an over-fed golden Lab entitled homer Simpson. Great morning meal with abounding of dining alternatives in the area. Pick up at the airport was glossy even with a air travel delay. We stayed for 4 nights in a Deluxe double room. The room was large and clean with big windows to catch the breeze and AC for when it got too hot. The bathroom was even larger and spotless. Our only complaint was that the bed was very hard, not the soft hotel beds we were used to. The hotel is about a 30 second walk from the Hippodrome and right beside the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, cistern, the main shopping street and about 10 mins walk to the Grand Bazaar. It was lovely to just walk around the cobbled streets and enjoy the pretty window-boxes and old buildings. The hotel is on a small side street which can get very busy and congested in the afternoons. We closed our windows one afternoon to catch a nap and generally kept the windows closed at night to keep some of the noise out. But this was a minor problem and well worth the great location. The airport transfer guy was very nice and drove safely (unlike all the other drivers in Turkey). He had to wait over an hour for us to clear customs but there wasn't a word of compaint and he got us to the hotel quickly but in one piece. Breakfast each day was quite basic but fine - lots of breads, cheeses, sliced meats, scrambled eggs with cereals and lovely chunks of watermelon. Hotel staff were very helpful. They held some of our luggage for a week while we traveled around. They offered us a late check-out, and even when we had already checked-out, they offered for us to shower and change before we went to the airport. We enjoyed our stay and would happily stay there again. he Fehmi Bey is a small and friendly family-owned hotel right in the historic heart of Istanbul, Sultanahmed, in a quiet street, just around the corner from the Hippodrome and the Blue Mosk. The location is ideal if you plan to do a lot of sightseeing, though I wouldn't recommend it to party animals, as after the herds of tourists have left for he night, the area is pretty dead. With only 20-something rooms, guests get a very personal welcome and approach. The receptionists are always ready to give advice about where to go, what to see and how to get there. They were also extremely helpful in organising us a taxi to the airport very early in the morning upon departure. Guests can freely use the 2 computers at the lobby and there even is a printer that can be used free of charge (great to print boarding passes) Breakfast is served on the top floor, with a nice view over the Marmara Sea. There is only a small buffet, but with a surprisingly large choice for such a small hotel. Apart from the extensive continental buffet there were also eggs and saussages. The room was tiny but very clean with all necessary amenties: a safe (complimentary), hair dryer, tv and fully fitted bathroom. We had a corner room on the 4th floor, overlooking the Marmara Sea. The only negative remark I can make is that the room wasn't very sound proof and we were woken up early by the seagulls on the roof, but we didn't suffer much for other noices. On Saturday night there was noice from the restaurant on the top floor until about midnight, but afterwards all was quiet again. All in all a cosy and budget friendly place for a city break!",,,
Jmmm,3226675,"Just stayed over Labor Day weekend. Hotel was really nice, new, and clean. The outdoor pool was great. Plenty of places to relax. You sign at the desk for beach towels. They have a Tiki Bar with good drinks and they serve some food there too. I didn't try the food. Free breakfast in the morning. Breakfast was good. A lot to choose from. They need to get better toasters. I would have to say, they were the slowest toasters I've ever used. Staff was friendly and helpful. We booked a studio suite. It was very roomy. The only complaint about the room was the shower head. It was the worst shower. They really need to do something about that. Over all, great place, good location. We would go back for sure. We have stayed at this hotel a few times. We love the location. The park behind the hotel is really nice and it's only a block from the beach. We really like the pool area too. We always feel comfortable there. I did notice that the bathroom wasn't as, up to par, as I would have liked. The grout on the bathroom floor around the tub and the bathroom floor itself could have been cleaner. When you see something like that, it just makes you wonder how clean the rest of the bathroom really is. A clean room is so important for us. Hope the hotel isn't slipping. It would be a shame. They could still redeem themselves if housekeeping steps it up a little. Good: Great location for the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards. Hotel itself was very nice. Not so Good: The room could have been cleaner. We had several spots on the carpets and the mini bar wouldn't open. We told someone about it but no one came to open it. At the Bistro, my son had a bug fly into his drink. It was quickly replaced, but still a turn off. It's the Hyatt Regency. We just expect more. I never felt comfortable in the room. I know that when we check in to a hotel that many people have stayed there before us, but I don't like feeling that way when I am there, and I did. We have stayed at Hyatts before, and are gold club members, but this left us a little disappointed. Also, a very weak shower. Felt like I was in the rain instead of under a shower. Hyatt can do better.","We booked a bay front suite with 2 queens. Decided on this hotel since all recommendations noted how new and clean it was. Bedding is superb. The property did not disappoint in any way. Only caveat might be for those with small children if going to the beach. You do have to cross the road that is three lanes in each direction. However, there is an island in between the traffic. We were there after Labor Day and it was easy to cross. not sure how it would be during the height of summer. Just stayed over Labor Day weekend.

The only complaint about the room was the shower head. It was the worst shower. They really need to do something about that. Over all, great place, good location. We would go back for sure. The Hampton Inn is new, so it is very clean and the rooms are comfortable. Beds and linens are exceptional. Service is good, everyone is polite and competent. Being new, there are just a few minor things that need ""tweaked"". The free breakfast is delicious, but whoever is making the coffee - it is very weak! The outdoor pool is lovely, however - be warned - the jacuzzi leads right into the pool area, and the kids use it for a jumping off point, so it can be hard to ever get in the jacuzzi and relax. I didn't think it's a good idea for the kids who were pretty small, to jump off the ledge into the pool, I believe someone's going to get hurt eventually. Also, the staff never seems to have enough towels out at the pool area, so it would probably be a good idea to stock more towels, as there were shortages each day. It was all in all a nice stay, however, I think if I was going to spend this much money on a room again, I'd prefer to be oceanside, simply because you have to cross 8 lanes of traffic to get to the beach. We enjoyed staying at this lovely new hotel overlooking the bay. Breakfast was plentiful, the outdoor pool was relaxing and the beach was just a short block across the street. The indoor pool was a plus since it rained during our visit. We stayed here the weekend of August 10. The hotel had been open for just three weeks. Our room was spacious and very nicely furnished. Every room has a balcony, which we really enjoyed. It was very clean (spotless), and the outdoor pool area overlooking the bay was beautiful. This location is one block from the beach, but you need to cross Coastal Highway to get there. There are restaurants close by and the Tiki Bar at the pool opened the weekend we were there. The free breakfast was quite good and offered many more choices than just muffins and yogurt. We found the front desk people to be vey nice, and although we weren't able to get a late checkout, we were told that we could use the pool after our checkout, which was a great perk. My family and I stayed for two nights in August, 2012. The hotel was definitely a five. It is beautiful and was decorated lovely. Breakfast was a plus. Most of the employees were polite and helpful. With the exception of the check in employees on Sunday. Very rude when I asked about the second car. Nothing in their website said you could have only one car. They told us to park it on the street. That is easier said then done. No spots to be found. During our stay, there were always empty spots on the lot. I gave it only a four as you had to cross a very busy street (eight lanes wide) to get to the beach. You also had to walk one block north and two blocks south to get to a crosswalk and traffic light. Loved that they change sheets and duvet covers for each stay. My family and I had the pleasure of staying only one night at the newly opened Hampton Inn. Upon our arrival we were met with a friendly staff. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and decorated to create a warm feel when you walk in. The lobby is quite impressive. Our room was the best we have stayed at in a long time. It was of course very clean. The beds were wonderful. Breakfast was more than enough with the best coffee and great food selections. The staff and everyone that we encountered went out of their way to make us feel at home. Zach at the front desk was very professional when we made our reservations and was even more professional when we arrived. They are working very hard to keep the hotel clean, They were really staying on top of things. We didn't want to leave, but will definitely be returning hopefully sooner than later. While we stayed for only one night, we really enjoyed this brand new hotel. The staff was very nice. The room was perfect . . . I think we were the first ones in that room! It is a good location too. I would go back.",,,
CottekillJim,2515545,"I just returned from a terrific trip to San Diego where I had a enjoyable and comfortable stay at The Rodeway Inn & Suites Downtown.

I had some last minute changes and instead of hearing "" Well sir, you see, the hotel policy is....."" I heard "" No problem, we can fix that for you, there will be no fee, happy to do that.....""

Jim","The exterior is a little rundown, but that's to be expected in an area next to the ocean where the air carries a high concentration of salt. The room was nothing spectacular but we were pleasantly surprised by the memory foam mattresses. Parking is not free, but that's also to be expected in downtown San Diego. The office staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is right near a large mall and not in a bad part of town. Overall, a pleasant stay. very average but inexpensive Motel. No breakfast but close to downtown and lot of restaurants. Not too noisy (street), but the bathroom fan of the next door room was very audible and annoying when it is turned on. Friendly and helpful staff. this is a 2 star location if all you want is an inexpensive room. Free WiFi and free use of computer at office. Plus free shuttle to airport from Holiday Inn Express across the street.

Jim Used this motell as just a stop off between flights and basically it's good value for a cheap price, nothing fancy at all, rooms were clean and decent. Staff much more helpful then often the case in this standard of hotel and this always makes a stay more pleasant! stayed here for 2 days, my 3rd time here,it is a good value no frills hotel located near the gaslamp district (great nightlife).and easy safe walking distance even late at night. the breakfast is not great very basic but for me that is not a great issue.there is a room safe for an extra fee but i was not charged this on this occasion. I found the staff very friendly and efficient there is also an airport shuttle available,free, from the hotel beside it .I had a pleasant stay and will stay there again if in san diego dv I would recommend this hotel to anybody that wants a good value,comfortable place to stay. The Rodeway is located a few blocks north of Broadway, so fairly central and within easy walking distance of the Gaslamp District and Horton Plaza. The room was large and comfortable. The only problem with it was that on the second day I returned to my room to find the door ajar. This must have been left like this by the housekeeper. Fortunately nothing was missing. It's an inexpensive place to stay with a central location, Balboa Park and the zoo are not far away and can be reached on foot. I booked this room because we wanted something that was dirt cheap but close enough to the Gaslamp District to party in. I was a little sketchy on the reviews but the almighty dollar crushed my fears. Don't be fooled by the price - the room (317) was really clean, we had a great view of the city & the price was excellent (kinda felt like I robbed them!). The front desk clerk who worked on Saturday (4/23) on the 3:30pm shift was extremely helpful & pleasant & gave us great tips as far as the beaches were concerned. I would have given the service 5 stars but the clerk that was working the front desk @ check out time was rude! I would recommend this place to family in friends - it's not the Embassy Suites but the location is great & it's clean! Oh & parking is $16 Hotel was very noisy and most of the noise was from the Maids. Not alot of parking space. Room was next to storage closet witch was caused excess noise all day..Otherwise the price and location was good and I would stay again if i cant find a better deal elsewhere. located within walking distance to many attractions but walk back is mainly uphill Standard 3-floor motel design surrounding a parking lot. Good location a few blocks from the Gaslamp district with lots of restaurants, clubs, and bars. Rooms are standard, functional, clean. A couple of times each evening, someone would push a flyer for a local restaurant under our door; otherwise it was quiet and seemed secure. There's wifi in the reception but it's weak in the rooms. The quoted price does not include a $16/day charge if you want to park a car there, which seems steep and borderline deceitful for a motel like this one. Parking outside the motel is scarce and metered, so paying the charge is pretty much mandatory if you have a car. Good Location. Desk staff fairly nice. Housekeepers mainly Hispanic and rude. Some appear racist, for sure. You know what I mean, they stare at some travelers like ""what are you doing here,"" then smile and grin at the ""vanilla middle class."" What a shame. But I guess they have been trained by society to act that way. Ignore them and you will enjoy your stay. There is a convenience store across the street; Horton Plaza mall is about 4 blocks away; and the trolley to Tijuana is about 3 blocks. rooms had been painted pryor to our stay, the tape was still over the the peep hole and you could not see out, the bed was broke, took forever to fix it, the inside door between rooms had split wood like the door had been kicked in, the carpet was dirty a clean pair of socks looked like you were walking around outside,but it was only a short distance from the bathroom,the tub was about a 3ft x3ft square no bath for me, a gap under the door let bugs in.i would not suggest this hotel. We really enjoyed our time here. The weather was pants compared to most times we've visited San Diego, but the Rodeway couldn't help that! The staff were really friendly and helpful and called us to let us know cabs had arrived and such, and it wasn't a great distance to the Gaslamp etc. However, coming back, it is up the worlds biggest hill, and it does threaten to kill you, but other than that, it's great! The breakfast was lovely, with a waffle maker, cereal, bagels, microwave, juice, hot drinks, and newspapers, and it set us up for the day. They have plenty of brochures in reception for what there is to do, and I'd highly recommend the zoo. The rooms were lovely and clean, and our cleaning girl, although limited in her English, tried to be as helpful as possible, and everything was cleaned daily. The only downside to our room was that we'd requested smoking and got non-smoking, but there was a wooden plant box with trees in it that we sat on to have a smoke. We arrived very early and were allowed to check in early. They gave us a corner room which was quiet. Smelled a little of cigarettes when we first walked in but when we turned on the AC didn't smell it anymore. Location was good a few blocks from the bus and the trolley. Did a lot of walking. Found a great little restaurant and bar on the corner across the street Sole Luna Cafe, ate breakfast there every morning, great coffee and food. Italian food served at lunch and dinner, owner's mother's authentic Italian recipes. Great bar as well.",,,
howdeppisyourlove,617577,"Located conveniently to just about everywhere in Manhattan with easy access to taxis and subways, this lovely hotel was a highlight of our trip to the USA. We walked or took the subway everywhere and found it very easy to do so from the Waldorf. The hotel is gorgeously decorated, attentive and helpful staff, friendly service, quality amenities and lovely rooms. Clean, fresh and well maintained in every way. We only had one sour note during our stay and that was on arriving, we were left standing with our luggage on the sidewalk for about 15 minutes before the doorman assisted us. We did expect better service from a Waldorf Hotel! Room service was excellent but very, very expensive. I cannot honestly fault this beautiful hotel and would happily stay here again when back in New York.

I cannot honestly fault this beautiful hotel and would happily stay here again when back in New York. Walk into the lobby and you know you are in a truly magnificent and elegant place. This is a very luxurious looking hotel from the moment you step foot inside her. The grand lobby is a delight to see and as we were here at Christmas we were very impressed by the tasteful and elegant decorations. The public areas are beautiful and do make you feel like you are in a special place. However, the rooms themselves are only of average quality. The decor in our room was a little dark and gloomy and the room was small and decidedly unimpressive. The bathroom was very nice and of a very good size. We have definitely stayed in far superior rooms in less expensive hotels. Compared to the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, New York, this hotel was just lacking the follow through that was promised by its elaborate lobby. We did not eat at the hotel or order room service so we cannot say anything about the food or food service. The most disappointing aspect of our stay here was that I ordered a wakeup phone call at 4.30 am so we could get to the airport- we did not receive this call. Thankfully my son set his cell phone alarm and woke us all up! When I bought this to the front desk employee's attention on check out, he simply said ""Sorry"", which seemed a little lame considering the wake up call was to get us to the airport and to our flights! Overall, it was a pleasant experience but not as well polished as we anticipated and certainly not of the superior quality most people would expect from such a hotel and brand. We would stay again, with reduced expectations next time. This is without comparison the absolute worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Not only are the room totally below even the most basic expectations, but the staff are uninterested and lax. But by far the worst thing about this hotel is that the staff cannot be trusted. We received a brand new credit card prior to leaving Australia and used it only once- at the Hotel Il Papavero when we booked in on the day we arrived. The next time we attempted to use the card it had been cancelled due to fraudulent use. Someone in the 24 hour period between us booking into the hotel had logged up over $3000 worth of internet shopping charges. Also a staff member actually tried to steal 10 euros from us by pretending we had given him a 10 euro note instead of a 20 euro note. UNBELIEVABLE!! Avoid these shifty people and this dingy little rat hole of a hotel at all costs!","Odd because the hotel is in different building with the reception, confusing at first, the reception is on the second floor, more like an apartment, but overall is okay, we got nice room (double room), the room is wide enough and clean, not sure the other rooms, I couldn't find any heater. We booked this hotel because its price, cheap enough and stayed for 2 nights. Not very close to Roma Termini Station but it was okay to walk. Well, when I stayed there, our bathroom was dirty all the time and there weren't enough outlets. There was no breakfast included in the price, no kitchen and no free Internet conexion. Staff was rude and made me pay 2 more euro per night because of a ""new tax"". Besides, every day there were somebody to wake up the rest of the people in the room and, of coure, staff didn't care about that. I paid 45 euros per night, which actually compares very favorably to 16-18 euros that are asked at hostels in Rome for a night stay in a dormitory!! Honestly, even with no free Internet, this hotel is a very good place to stay if you come for a weekend! AND!!!! do NOT MISS - having followed our noses one evening, we discovered an amazing place - bakery / pasticherria - just around the corner - Sorchetta Doppio Schizzo, via Cernaia 47! The owner, Antonio, makes the most amazing and varied croissants, and other Italian delicatessen! We ended up spending there all mornings for breakfast and evenings for pizza!

Avoid these shifty people and this dingy little rat hole of a hotel at all costs! We stayed here on the first day of our trip and the last day. It was like two different experiences. The first day we were put in a building a good 1/4 mile from the hotel's location near the train station. The room was the size of a closet, the TV did not work, it was noisy, the bed was only 5 foot long, and the bathroom (if you could call it that, smelled awful. I was stuck with the last night so I dreaded coming back. When we arrived for our last night I complained and we were then put in another location around the corner from there office which was a world of difference. Believe me still not plush (for 80 euros you cannot expect much) but nothing like the first room. Moral of the story - DO NOT let them put you near the train station for YOUR CONVENIENCE as I was told by the individual that spoke English. The breakfasts were at snack bars across the street with a voucher for a roll and coffee. Would I stay here again - probably not. I would probably eat the higher cost and stay at the Hotel Raffaello (heaven). We had orginally booked this hotel, but when we went to check in we were told we would be moved to their other hotel. We were told that the other hotel was much better and closer to the termini station. I was a little ticked off at the start because I had not booked the other hotel.. Checking is was ok, but it seems as though the italians need to brush up on their customer service skills. They can be quite rude as times. We ended up following the receptionist guy in his car so he could take us to the other hotel. The area was quite dodgy, and I would have never walked alone on the streets. Full of asians and africans, beer bottles etc. It was real close to the Termini station about a few minutes away. The rooms were quite big. We had 2 rooms, one with 3 guests and the other room with one. We orginally booked 3 single beds but were given a double bed plus the 2 singles...so that was a bonus. The rooms contained a small bathroom, large window and a fan. In our particular hotel there were only 4 rooms. BE CAREFUL...the same key that is given to you opens the other rooms too! Luckily for us there were no other guests in the room! Please be mindful of this. That was the only downfall. When booking make sure you are booking the hotel that states on the site. We Being the first time I've stayed in anything less than 4 stars, I was extremely nervous. It was such an awesome time, we met a great group of people and the service couldn't have been better. The rooms are spacious and always clean. The front staff is very accommodating, we were there over the Volcano Eruption and they had no problem finding us a room for two extra nights. The price is exceptional for what you get. Free Internet, and free Breakfast. Yes you have to go across the street, but aren't you leaving in the morning for sight seeing anyways? We walked to the Colosseum and to the Trastevere area and pretty much everything we wanted to see, go around the corner to your right and you'll find a quaint little bakery that has an electric staff and delicious treats! Can't wait to be back...Love your Canadian Friends :D We selected this hotel (which is actually rooms in different sections of an apartment building) because of its proximity to Termini station, and Piazza della Repubblica, two places to pick up the metro or buses for our week of sightseeing, and it was affordable for an extended stay. The location exceeded our expectations. It is an easy 10 minute walk from Termini Station with a grocery store, pizzarias and restaurants all along the way. The walk to Repubblica was about 5 minutes. We felt very safe walking in the neighborhood both day and night. There are different outside door entrances to the different rooms (you are given keys for all doors you must use). The rooms are quiet (no street sounds at night), very clean and the beds comfortable. You notice we say rooms and beds. We left Rome twice for trips to other countries and each time we returned we were given a different room. The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. We honestly miss seeing Ica, Georgia and Adriano each day. They gave us great tips for sightseeing and shared our excitement at reconnecting with family. Internet access is available at the reception area, which we all know is quite helpful when traveling for extended periods of time. The coffee and breakfast croissant, at the cafe across the street from the hotel was a quick and easy way to begin each day of sightseeing and eating our way through Rome! Yes we will stay there again if we ever get the chance to return to Rome! We just came back from Rome. Originally we had a reservation for Hotel Virginia that is on the next street but we were shifted to Il Papavero Hotel. The stuff was friendly although they didn't speak English almost at all. The price for a twin room with bathroom was 40 euro per night! Which was really cheap! The room was small but very clean, the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was small too but again very clean. Well the walls are thin but we didn't have problem with this, didn't have noisy neighbors :) We receive a coupon for free breakfast - croissant and cappuccino, which were fantastic. The hotel is near to the metro station Castro Pretorio - 10 min walk, and near to Termini - 10min walk. I definitely liked the hotel for its price. considering the comments that are on the site, you can expect anything but .... for only one star hotel you can not ask for more. staff can help you with any information, the rooms are clean.very good price quality . the reviews are a little far for the hotel,if you do not like it go to a 3 star hotel :))) keep it up IL PAPAVERO",,,
PinkNeve31,1639253,"We stayed here for three nights, basically crashed with a friend last minute and it was such a pleasure. The rooms are basically beautiful apartments. There is so much space, full kitchen and bathrooms. Everything about it was perfect. We spent a lot of time in the back yard area where we blasted music and soaked in the private jacuzzi. No one complained about us, everything was spotless, and the privacy is surprising. There is every amenity you can imagine, right down to the king sized beds. The front desk didnt give our friend a hard time about adding guests last minute, like other hotels did. There were also pull down beds in the living room area, even these beds were incredibly comfortable, providing space for up to 8 people. There were a lot of families there, and seems like this particular hotel is preferred for families and couples. I loved this facility, however I did have one terrible experience that I must alert the public of so that you may protect yourself. There is one taxi service that runs throughout ALL the hotels. Although each taxi driver has to check in and notes which room they are taking where, the taxi and hotel are not associated with eachother. So, My purse string broke in the cab and my bag was left behind. The cab driver took my purse, did not report it to lost and found. The cab driver took my wallet and charged hundreds of dollars on my credit cards to local Autozone. All my cash, cards, phone,camera, etc were gone - mid trip. It was a night mare. Even though the hotel knows exactly who our driver was, and the police had his info, they did not pursue him and nothing was done to get justice, or return my belongings. So please be careful with your bags, and do not take an eye off your property. If anything is left behind, it will be taken. So keep that in mind. Here's the deal: it's no fancy, beautiful hacienda, BUT talk about affordable and convenient. I went to Playa Del Carmen Mexico for the BPM music festival, which is one of the most popular events in the area, and we had a hard time finding ANY hotel availability, never mind deals. Hotel Plaza Playa is not loaded with amenities and it is far from scenic or dreamy, but it has what you need at an amazing rate. We booked on hotels.com for about $50 a night, during the most popular nights of the festival!! PROS: clean (towels, sheets, overall room), walking distance from prime party area (approx 10 blocks or so), friendly staff (extremely helpful, and bilingual), internet (not best connection, but fairly consistent), around the block from THE BEST taco spot ""El Fagon"" (recommended by all the locals) as well as La Mega (like Wal-Mart), elevator, close to public transport, balconies in most rooms (for smokers), plenty of parking, easy going staff (not all up in your business, trying to charge you for visitors (like hotels on the strip do), and generally safe (two single girls in our party, never had any issues walking alone late night). CONS: WORST shower I have ever had in my life (requires some kind of secret code of mechanics in order to get hot water), no safe, no room phones, no pool, no amenities, and construction going on across the street (while we were there). Also lengthy walk to beach, and everything scenic. If you are looking for a place to keep your stuff safe, and only utilize the room for sleeping and preparing to party then this is your best bet. It's not far from the strip, plenty of convenient shopping and transport, and best of all the price is low as can be for an area that is starting to bang out tourists for every single convenience.","The most important thing was that the hotel was very clean. The room was large and the three of us fit there very comfortably. The staff was very friendly and helped us a lot with directions, top sites to see and food options. The breakfast every morning was delicious. All home made Mexican fare as well as cereal, fruits, yogurt. The family that runs the hotel were very warm and made us feel like we had a home not just a hotel. It was just a 10 minute walk to the beach which honestly felt like nothing at all because it was a really nice walk. Here's the deal: it's no fancy, beautiful hacienda, BUT talk about affordable and convenient. I went to Playa Del Carmen Mexico for the BPM music festival, which is one of the most popular events in the area, and we had a hard time finding ANY hotel availability, never mind deals. Hotel Plaza Playa is not loaded with amenities and it is far from scenic or dreamy, but it has what you need at an amazing rate. We booked on hotels.com for about $50 a night, during the most popular nights of the festival!! PROS: clean (towels, sheets, overall room), walking distance from prime party area (approx 10 blocks or so), friendly staff (extremely helpful, and bilingual), internet (not best connection, but fairly consistent), around the block from THE BEST taco spot ""El Fagon"" (recommended by all the locals) as well as La Mega (like Wal-Mart), elevator, close to public transport, balconies in most rooms (for smokers), plenty of parking, easy going staff (not all up in your business, trying to charge you for visitors (like hotels on the strip do), and generally safe (two single girls in our party, never had any issues walking alone late night). CONS: WORST shower I have ever had in my life (requires some kind of secret code of mechanics in order to get hot water), no safe, no room phones, no pool, no amenities, and construction going on across the street (while we were there). Also lengthy walk to beach, and everything scenic. If you are looking for a place to keep your stuff safe, and only utilize the room for sleeping and preparing to party then this is your best bet. It's not far from the strip, plenty of convenient shopping and transport, and best of all the price is low as can be for an area that is starting to bang out tourists for every single convenience. We stayed one night here on business in early January. Mid priced hotel, clean rooms, good shower, comfortable beds. Included breakfast was good, with good choice and quantity. Only annoyance was that the wireless internet signal was only available in public areas of the hotel not in the rooms, meaning that to work, I had to lurk around the area near the elevators... which had seating, presumably for that purpose. Overall a good place to stay.",,,
stephen c,289342,"I'm on my first night of a 3 night stay. Firstly, the hotel is old. e.g., the phones in the room have the numbers worn off, and the same for the TV remote. Rooms are average but definitely on the older side with things like a wide, comfort chair for the desk. Useless if you want to do any work but OK if you want to take a nap. On top of that, tonight TSA decided to do some drilling in the building housing the hotel and it's reverberating quite loudly in my room. Spoke to the front desk and they said they have no control over the TSA or the noise but that it should be finished by 11pm. Most other hotels seem to be sold out this week or I would move out. Bottom line - stay somewhere else unless you desperately need to be near the airport. The Magic Castle Hotel came highly recommended to us and we are so glad we stayed there. The staff were excellent in every way - nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make our stay one to remember. The rooms were clean and welcoming - the breakfasts very pleasant by the pool, the free snacks, hot cider and biscuits very handy late at night. We were first timers in Los Angeles and the hotel seemed very well placed to make the most of Hollywood attractions.

Situated just in front of Universitat de Barcelona, across the metro station, surrounded by shopping area, restaurants and 5-10 minutes walk to Plaza de Catalunya. The staff are very friendly and helpful and even helped us to printed out our boarding pass for free. Free wifi available only at the lobby and there are PCs available for guests. The room is a bit out dated but clean and comfortable enough. We got the corner room with the view of Universitat de Barcelona which we are quiet happy with. This hotel is in a great location. The aerobus drops you off right across the square from here and the metro station is just a few steps from the hotel. Very easy to walk to Las Ramblas, the nice area up by Casa Battlo and you can actually walk to the beach from here (30 minute walk). Lots of restaurants and stores in the area. Didn't get the breakfast. No wifi but the room was cleaned daily. Very simple rooms but they do have a safe in them. This hotel is in an excellent location, aprox 150m from Placa de Catalunya with excellent transport links to the airport (via Aerobus) and around town using the excellent Metro system (there is a stop about 10m from the front door of the hotel. The staff are friendly and the hotel is clean and well maintained. Only issue I had with this hotel is that the rooms were very small. But for the price and location I can't complain. Breakfasts were a continental buffet. There was plenty of choice of meat, cheese, bread, pastries, cerials. Overall an excellent stay. We recently spent a weekend at this hotel. The location was very good - close to the Unversity and La Rambla. The cost was very reasonable making this a good value. There were a number of inexpensive locations for breakfast nearby. However, the rooms were very small and there was a good amount of street noise so that should be taken into consideration for those who might be bothered by that. Also Internet is only available in the lobby. We stayed here during our European honeymoon between Christmas & NYE in 2007. We were coming from a very bad hotel stay in Dublin, so my expectations & spirits were pretty low. I'll admit that upon walking into the tiny lobby, I didn't get an excellent first impression, and worried that it was going to be more of the same. Fortunately, when we got off the lift and walked into our room, I was very pleasantly surprised! I will say that I think we had one of the biggest rooms in the hotel (the rounded, corner room with a whole wall full of windows), according to the emergency evacuation floor plan, so that could make a difference. But, we were very happy with our room, and it instantly made us excited about our trip once again. We were out exploring Barcelona most of the time, but we were always happy to return back to the room at the end of each day. It was safe, quiet, and clean. We were really surprised at how quiet the room was even though all of our windows faced out on the corner of the street which was a very heavy traffic area & right across from the University. We rarely heard any road or horn noise. We also appreciated the free breakfast (although, the breakfast room feels like a dungeon) & espresso machine each morning. It wasn't anything fancy, but it was fine for a free light meal. The front desk staff was really helpful. I came down with a bad cold while we were staying there, and they explained how to find (and use) the Farmacias there. They also directed us on how to get to La Rambla (which is only a few blocks away), Parc Guell, and the nearby Open Top Bus Tour stop. The ideal location, clean, modern rooms, and low price (in comparison to surrounding hotels) makes this a hidden gem. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! A good choice in an area dominated by much more expensive hotels. The location is great, 5 minutes from Placa Catalunya, the heart of Barcelona, and one end of La Rambla. Modern furniture, a very nice hardwood floor imitation which entices to cleanliness. Our room, 408, a triple, had a nice a bathroom with a window, that can be opened allowing for quick steam and smell elimination. The 2 single beds were very good, but the third bed, a single sofa bed, would not be comfortable for an adult. It also makes the room quite small, when extended for use, but if you only use the room to sleep and wash, as we did, it is OK. I would emphasize again the CLEANLINESS, the bed linen is spotless white, as the towels. There are no rugs, a plus from a health point of view, just plain shiny laminate floors.",,,
MartynG_11,228937,Stayed last week at the Remco Amsterdam City West. Found a great price for my stay and the hotel proved to be good. I was allocated a large room with a large double bed which for a solo traveller is a nice touch. Free wifi in the room worked perfectly. The hotel is reached by tram 17 to Hoekenes (30 minutes) tram stop and then its a 5 minute walk. Also the tram and bus 63 runs near the hotel to Station Leylaan for connections to Schipol. The hotel is located on a large housing development and those arriving at night need to be aware of this and take care but no more than you would in any large city as a new arrival. I read other reviews on this place which suggested basic. Indeed it is but I found staying here a really nice experience. Very clean room at the back of the hotel not overlooking the Santa Maria Elisabetta was super quiet. I enjoyed the free wireless downstairs in the lobby area. No A/C but a large fan in the room made things just fine. All of the staff I encountered were personable and friendly. I would definitely go back as with anywhere you are made to feel welcome you tend to remember.,"Nothing special, a quiet hotel half way up the main road in Lido (none of the locals seem to be able to give good direction to it though). We stayed in a double room for Ã¢âÂ¬50 a night, nice big rooms with en suite and itÃ¢â¬â¢s a 2 min walk from the local supermarket (not that they have a kitchen for you to use) you can however pay an additional Ã¢âÂ¬5 per person for the breakfast which we chose to pass on. Overall it was a pleasant stay but the hotel lacks personality, you also have to take into consideration that will have to pay $6.50 for the water bus into Venice everyday (or buy a 3 or 5 day water bus pass for around Ã¢âÂ¬30 to Ã¢âÂ¬50) I think a lot of your opinion of this hotel will be determined by whether you had a room facing the street or not. We did and did not have the best stay here. The room was really warm, even with the provided fan, and we couldn't close the windows at all, due to the heat, allowing the streetlights (which are pointed up for some reason) to illuminate the room something fierce. The location was good, with Lido being a much more inexpensive option than Venice (with better priced restaurants), but only a short ferry ride away. Also a short walk to the beach in the other direction. The hotel was clean and had good WiFi in the lobby. PS. try the restaurant almost below the Hotel, great food at decent prices. We would probably stay there again, but this hotel is definitely better in the cooler months. I read other reviews on this place which suggested basic. Indeed it is but I found staying here a really nice experience. Very clean room at the back of the hotel not overlooking the Santa Maria Elisabetta was super quiet.

I would definitely go back as with anywhere you are made to feel welcome you tend to remember. Simple, Clean, Budget Hotel. Great location on the lido in lovely bustling neighbourhood. 5 mins from vaporetto and 15- 20 mins journey to st marks square. We didnt have breakfast. Its a basic hotel but if all your looking for is a clean bed in a nice safe area its perfect. First impressions walking into the ""lobby"", a seedy old man sitting behind a counter. No computer, just notepads. Then, I had to drag my luggage up the stairs (no lifts). We reached our room, and had to use actual keys to open our door, which took us about 5 minutes and a whole look of jimmying to be able to get it to unlock. After opening the door, we were greeted by a strange, bleach kind of smell. Bathroom was clean which was nice. Room was very old. It had a tiny analogue tv with a remote that didn't work. The bed was old, and was actually two singles pushed together with a double sheet over it. After the second night of sleeping, though, I woke up with red bites all over my body. It seems I was attacked by bed bugs. This was not acceptable. I would not recommended this hotel to anyone. Also, most of the time there was no one at reception. On their website they advertise a buffet breakfast, I never saw anything of the sort. Nor was there internet access like described also. Not worth the money spent, even if it was cheap. Room: very small, with old furniture but clean. no problems with hot&cold water. no problems with reservation, check-in/out, etc. Location: the street is rather noisy (e.g. buses) but it's ok in general. it takes 5-10 minutes to get to vaporetto by foot. it takes approximately 10 minutes to get to the main island by vaporetto. with 72h ticket it's not a problem to live on Lido. Lido in general wonderful place to walk and live, with fresh air & lots of restaurants.",,,
Lisa8383,487409,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic. It is only a two minute walk to St Mark's square (literally around the corner from it) and we had a view from our room of all the gondolas floating by, which was great to see. The rooms were furnished beautifully with some pieces of antique looking furniture. Everything is new and the bathroom was very modern. You can get dropped off right at the door of this hotel if you get a private water taxi, which is handy if you have luggage. The location is perfect, the rooms had plenty of space and the beds were so nice to sleep in. I've been to five star hotels and this is definitely one of them. The reception staff are so helpful at this hotel. They have great advice about where to eat and how to get the most out of your stay in Rome providing you with helpful tips. The hotel has a nice Terrace where you can sit and have a drink while looking over some of the surrounding rooftops. Its very clean and pretty central to most site seeing activities in Rome. You just walk down the road to get to the Coloseum. Great hotel and would definitely stay here again. This was a great hotel, very clean and close to the underground train station. The breakfast was nice and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The only problem with this hotel is the fact that it doesn't have a lift, which makes it difficult if you have heavy luggage. However, the fact that it is pretty affordable and in a great location makes you forget the fact that you have to climb a few stairs.","My daughter and I stayed here for four nights in November. Both the bathroom and bedroom were good sizes by Paris standards. The decor was excellent, warm and welcoming. The hotel is well positioned for access to the Opera area. There are many restaurants within a two or three block radius. This is a two star hotel so there are limited amenities in the rooms; no fridge, only one english langauage channel on the tv (repeating the same programming every day). This was not an issue for us as we were there only to rest and sleep. The man in the little bar next door sold us water each evening and we returned the glass bottles the next morning. It worked for us. A couple of minor issues I noted. The bathroom tiles in the shower area are getting decidely tatty and need the grout cleaning or replacing to remove mould. At night we had to keep the bathroom door closed as we could clearly hear people arguing in another room through the air/steam vent. Most staff were excellent although one had little knowledge of tourist info. Very, very friendly and welcoming all the same. Great small hotel in Paris, centrally located walking distance from the Opera (and the big department stores). Super friendly staff, the room was larger than what we have experienced for similar priced hotels in Paris, good organic breakfast buffet (inexpensive for Paris at 9 euros). The weather was nice so we were lucky to be able to use the rooftop terrace to open a bottle of wine before dinner. We'll definitely return. The hotel is indeed clean and somewhat cosy, at present with free wi-fi. The location is not so good. My room was ok, but had a incredibly small bathroom and a horrible window view. Yet the worst part is the noise: you inevitably hear all the time people going up and down the wooden stairs and sometimes even in their rooms. Friendly staff. I would not say it is a good value hotel We booked a triple room in Hotel Mogador based on the tripadvisor reviews, and was very pleased to see that it was a very good size. Small rooms are the norm in Europe (and especially in Paris), so we were very grateful to have the extra space and not have to feel cramped. The room was clean, and the hotel was in a good location (20 mins walk to the Louvre). NB: We stayed in May 2010 (but 'Date of stay' didn't have that option). We chose this place solely for central location and value, but we also got great service to boot, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Wifey was pregnant so the stairs were a bit tiring for her, but the room and bathroom were fine for the price, especially since we were using the room more as a sleeping base than anything else. Front staff desk was very helpful. For a 2-star hotel, if you are looking for a great value in Paris with a great location, this is the place to stay. No AC or elevator and not the most comfortable bed in the world (but what are you expecting from a 2-star hotel). Room was as large or larger than the 4-star hotel I stayed in for work, nice, clean bathroom. The Hotel is located about 5 Minutes away from Opera Garnier and Boulevard Haussmann whith Paris' most famous shops Galeries Lafayette and Printemps. Montmartre is just a 10 minutes walk away. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s also close to metro lines 7 and 12. These lines are perfect not only if you arrive at and depart from Gare de lÃ¢â¬â¢est, but also if you want to go to Louvre, Champs Elysees, Notre Dame... The rooms are small (some of them smaller than others) but not too small and even though the hotel is located at a quiet street we were happy to have rooms to the backyard. These rooms probably also get less hot in the summer time (no regular airconditioning, but in the closets there were either ventilators or air conditionings for hotter days, also no mini bar/fridge in the rooms). The only noise comes from inside the hotel. Walls are really thin. Accordingly I recommend earplugs for those with a light sleep. The rooms are quite clean (even though they should dust the cushions on the wall above the bed as well as the old mirrors). When I read the feedback at tripadvisor that one of the guests felt attacked by a toilet role holder, I was wondering how this could be a problem for anyone. Now I know because I obviously got the same room as this person. This roll holder has to be taken off. It is dangerous. As already said by others on tripadvisor: there is no elevator in the hotel, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s a small hotel with only about three floors and the receptionists offer to help you with luggage. I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t try the wireless internet in the rooms, instead I used the computer in the lobby to check emails etc. The breakfast was quite good for Paris standard: great baguette, croissant (with chocolate) and bread, cereals, jam, yoghurt, cheese. Most of the people working at the reception were really friendly and helpful. We had a great stay, loved the location, and definitely recommend this hotel and will come back. Lovely hotel!Really close to the metro station and various shops,restaurants and bistros.Staff were amazingly polite and helpful!No stairs but we knew that already.Breakfast is pricey for what it offers (just some croissants and baguettes) but there are plenty of places for breakfast around.We stayed in a room for four.It was cosy and lovely,really felt we were in Paris.Quiet street but safe.The wc was in a different space from the bath which was convenient in the morning when there are 4 people who want to get ready.It was very clean as well.I absolutely loved that hotel! I only stayed one night as it is very close to the CDG airport bus stop, easy walk. My room was a nice size but the bathroom was something else, tiny and the toilet almost impossible to back into. Yes, back into. As well there was a toilet roll holder hanging loose at the side of the loo and the thing almost attacked me and was highly dangerous, it could cause a nasty injury, who in their right mind chose to put it there is crazy. The breakfast was only okay and I only had it there for quickness as I left early to the airport. As is usual in Paris, the breakfast was overpriced. The owners are nice and helpful so cannot fault that side of the stay. If you need to be near the Opera Garnier or Galeries Lafayette area, the location is excellent. Stayed here for 3 nights ov er New Year. Hotel in a fantastic location, close to a few metro stops for various lines, and near the stop at Opera for the Roissy Bus from CDG airport and the open top tour bus which is a great way to get around and see Paris. The hotel can be a bit noisy, however if you shut the door outside your room door this quietens things down quite a lot. All in all the hotel is really affordable in comparison to others, has very nice traditional rooms, it's in a great location and will provide a great base for a nice time in Paris. This was a great hotel, very clean and close to the underground train station. The breakfast was nice and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The only problem with this hotel is the fact that it doesn't have a lift, which makes it difficult if you have heavy luggage. However, the fact that it is pretty affordable and in a great location makes you forget the fact that you have to climb a few stairs. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Mogador for 2 nights October 19th and 20th, 2010. We had a quiet room and a good sleep. I couldn't get the tub to work, so had to shower, also the hotel seemed to run out of hot water in the morning. Nonethless, the location is ideal and the reception staff were marvelous, helping us try to get a taxi one morning during the strike. Mogador is a hidden jewel offering excellent value for the money. It's decorated with taste in a slightly rustical style. The personnel was very nice and genuinely interested in our satisfaction. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is located in a renovated walk-up building, so be prepared to drag your suitcase up the stairs. Also, luckily the summer was still in Paris, as the window in our room didn't close and could not be fixed by the hotel staff. It would be a serious problem in winter. The hotel has a nice terrace with tables and chairs, which offers an excellent opportunity to admire Parisian stairs. I am always very nervous when arriving at hotels in Paris within this price bracket as I have had some bad experiences but this hotel is wonderful! The rooms are spacious and very clean, the bathrooms well appointed and the location great. The building is quite old (as is the norm with Paris) so it was a little noisy in the morning when everyone is heading out for the day but other than that - perfect! I can't wait to stay here again and would highly recommend it! I kept waiting for the catch because it was so good! It is also within easy walking distance to many attractions.",,,
margueriteOttawa,275959,"We stayed at this hotel because of the Number 1 rating on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed - it was exceptional. The location, rooms, staff were all wonderful. The hotel is near all the major sights, close to wonderful eating spots and markets and bazaars. The rooms are exceptional which to us is a must. Large and comfortable - wonderful furnishings. It is only 6 months old - and still perfect. The staff are friendly; knowledgeable and very helpful - laundry service fast and not expensive - mini bar prices were reasoable - unlike most of the other hotels we stayed at in Turkey. We stayed 3 nights at the Suitedreams - based on the excellent Trip Advisor ratings and we were not disappointed. The breakfast (which was included because we booked using their website was EXCELLENT) - The bathrooms were fantastic - the room was smallish and had only one chair. Without a doubt this hotel has the BEST FRONT DESK STAFF of any hotel I have ever stayed. They took a lot of time to explain locations of interest, book restaurants and help us with bags etc. This is a class act!! We stayed at the Locanda Herion for 2 nights prior to leaving for a cruise from Venice. The hotel was excellent - near the train station and Piazzole Roma (and away from San Marco Square and all the tourists). The breakfast was wonderful and the bedroom was large. It is very quiet . It is in Canarregio - which is a real neighbourhood - lots of restaurants and shops , a real local food market, and a much less touristy feeling . Ask them to email directions. Although you have to walk up a flight of stairs - the staff are there and very willing to be of help with maps and directions and suggestions. Get a IMOB pass for the vaporettos and go to LIDO, Murano and Giudecca.","Just come back from 4 nights at this hotel, and was very impressed with what they are able to offer for the price. Booked through venere.com, who seem to have good prices. The hotel was spotlessly clean, my room was comfortable and a decent, and service was friendly (although nobody there after midday, maybe that's because of the season, although there was somone there to check me in on the day I arrived at 6pm). Reasonably good and plentiful breakfast. I found the hotel a little hard to find on arrival, I don't really understand the Venetian address system, and the directions are not that clear. But it's only 2 minutes from the S Marcuola Vaporetto stop, and very convenient for getting around the city (also for the Vaporetto stop for Murano and Burano). Lots of good, reasonably priced-trattorias and osterias in the area too. I'll defnitely go back to the Herion if I ever get to go back to Venice. We recently stayed at the Locanda Herion before a cruise from Venice. We have stayed there twice before. It is great for combining convenience and price. The rooms have always been very clean. It isn't fancy, but entirely adequate in this high priced city. By taking the vaporetto when we arrived to the Marcouli stop, we reached the hotel in 5 minutes. Breakfast was very good and the staff is most helpful. We really liked this hotel even though the breakfast was quite poor, but we were prepared when we chose this hotel so we weren't even disappointed. Hotel was small and charming. The staff was very friendly and our room was fantastic! Also the bed was the most comfortable ever! We'd definitely go back! Location was convenient because it was close to the railway station and water taxis were also nearby. St. Marc's Square was about 20 minutes away if you want to walk there. We stayed at the Locanda Herion for 2 nights prior to leaving for a cruise from Venice.

Get a IMOB pass for the vaporettos and go to LIDO, Murano and Giudecca. We stayed at the Locanda Herion for 3 nights in October this year. We chose it from the reviews on Tripadvisor and because it was on of the few remotely affordable hotels we could find. Despite it being a bit difficult to find (we arrived at night in the pouring rain) it is a lovely little hotel. The staff are really helpful and speak very good english. Our room was a standard double decorated in classic italian sparse decour but very stylish and there was a lovely big bathroom with a nice shower. The hotel is very small and has a lovely indoor terrace area which Im sure which be lovely in the Summer. The only downsides are that there are no real communal space to relax in and the breakfast is very basic (croissant and tea or coffee from a machine). The location is the best thing about this hotel though, it is 5 minutes walk from the Guglie Vaporetto stop which takes you to the airport in 35 minutes and into the main part of Venice in minutes. You can walk everywhere easily from here and the Canneregio area itself is really nice and less touristy than other parts we saw. I would happily recommend this hotel and Venice, just remember to take comfy shoes! We stayed 4 nights, Great location, very close to train station. But most importantly the room was larger and nice than any other hotels we stayed before! Bathroom was clean and large. The guy there is very friendly. Overall, i would definitely stay there again. The guy who works here is incredibly nice. The room was very comfortable, and the breakfast was the best I had in my 3 weeks in Italy. It's also served on a nice patio. No refrigerator, and the volume on the tv is set so low that you can't hear it, but otherwise this hotel was perfect. I'd love to stay here again. The hotel is located close to the train station, so it is a convenient walk for our one-night stay. You have to look for the tiny sign on the side of a building pointing to the right, as the hotel entrance is behind the building that faces the main street. The clerk was very attentive, carried our bags upstairs, and was very helpful. He showed us how to use the air conditioner and opened breakfast early just for us when we had an early train to catch. He deserves an A+ for excellent service. Breakfast was nice and a terrace is available when the weather is nice. The room was very large with a king-sized bed and a twin bed. It had a chandelier and elegant ceiling paintings. The only problem we noted was quite a bit of mildew and mold in the shower and bathroom. The room was very quiet and comfortable and had a tv and a wardrobe for clothes. We never heard any other guests or any noise. We had a very nice stay... located in a nice part of Venice where we felt very safe. The room we stayed in was clean and very well maintained. The room has real air conditioning with morn insulated windows, so no major noice and a confortable night sleep. The only problem was the directions to find the hotel. Get off at the Guglia stop.... walk towards the bridge that crosses the canal... turn left on Conneregio... walk until you see a small copper colored plaque that says Locanda Herion loacted on the right side of the street about 10 feet up on the corner of a building... turn right down that street and you're there... Clean with nice people... what more can you really ask for. We recently stayed in Venice for the weekend and arrived around midnight. The guy there did not speak English, but was pleasant and signed us in. He showed us to our room, then after we settled in, he realized he gave us the wrong room and took us to another, bigger room. So, not a big deal. The owner the next morning was very pleasant (and spoke English) and apologized for the mix up. At check-out he even gave us back some $ because we were still in the wrong room! Overall, I would say this hotel is perfect for a quick getaway. The room was clean, the bathroom was very clean (which I value most), the staff were friendly, and the location is in a pretty quiet spot, which makes for a good night sleep. We were able to leave our bags at the front after we checked out to do some more sightseeing before we left. On Sundays, no one works there, so you are able to get a key to the front door to get in. I will definitely stay there again if I go back to Venice. The owner said you might get a discount by booking directly with them particularly during the summer. So ask!",,,
2islandhoppers,324713,"We stayed one night, arriving in Rome late in the afternoon and leaving by train the following morning. This hotel was fine for a short stay, but the area in which the hotel is located is not the greatest although it is close to a metro stop. The hotel was very clean, rooms comfortable, the staff helpful and pleasant. I would certainly stay here again if I needed a hotel close to Termini station. This hotel is at the airport, and shuttle buses run 24 hrs/day to/from the airport and transit system into the city. However, unless you are prepared to journey into the city (and it is a 'journey'), you are stuck paying their outrageous prices for meals. It was so expensive we decided to forego entrees, and stuck with $16 appies and a glass of wine. My calamari was so overcooked, it was only recognizable as crunchy fried strips. On the positive side, although we booked with Hotwire we were placed in a 15th floor harbor view room. There was no noise from the hotel exterior, but the corridors and rooms had paper thin walls and you could hear all conversations from neighbors and halls. There is an additional charge for parking and WiFi use. The hotel is convenient if you need an overnight before a flight, but for vacationing/sightseeing in Boston, the location is fairly isolated and you need to be prepared to take transit into the city. The rate I got through Hotwire was exceptional, otherwise this would not have been my first choice for an extended stay.","Small room but clean. No security card lock. Clean and nice bathroom. Free wifi in room. Simple breakfast in buffet style. Helpful front desk staff. Within Station Termini district which is very convenient but it's very dirty and feel insecure. There are lot's more hotel for your options, which are more nearer to Station Termini. We stayed one night, arriving in Rome late in the afternoon and leaving by train the following morning.

mswguitar,112281,"My wife and I went to Vegas to work on our rental property and we decided to stay at the South Point. I found the rates to be very reasonable and the hotel had pretty much everything you need right there. We didn't get a change to enjoy it all but it has a movie theater, bowling alley, and several restaurants. There are a lot of different restaurants with pretty much any style cuisine you could want. The AC unit in our room made an annoying ticking noise that made it hard to sleep so we notified the front desk after the first night and they moved us into a new room for the remainder of our stay. They also discounted all of the nights we stayed there so we basically ended up getting the last night free. The rooms are nice and very roomy with a 42"" flat screen TV. We are going back to Las Vegas soon for a quick trip and we will be staying at the South Point again.

My wife and I celebrated Valentines Day on Saturday by leaving the kids with the grandparents and coming down to the beach. We will often just head down to PB and wing-it, finding a room that day (as opposed to booking in advance). My wife had stayed at the Beach Cottages in the past but this was my first time here. All in all, not a bad hotel if you're looking for a beach front property. This hotel is old and shows it's age, but our room was fine. It was quite small but since it was just the two of us, it worked out perfectly. It also wasn't too pricey but it was off-season, so I'm sure it would have been twice as much during the summer months. We got a room on the 3rd floor in the main building and the view was spectacular. We were able to park for free in the hotel parking lot (a definite plus in PB) and walk to wherever we wanted. Because of the location, price, parking, and the view, we will definitely consider staying here again, especially for off-season visits to the beach.

Stayed this past week at Beach Cottages in cottage 512..on the beach.. and we loved it there. We heard good things from family who have stayed there in the past. The sunsets were awesome. We really enjoyed watching the surfers and dolphins... Very very clean, the beds are comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. Just a quick walk to Ralph's and Trader Joe's for some goodies and we were settled in in no time. Housekeeping stops by every day to see if you need anything. My only regret is that we rented a car for a week which we hardly used at all. We enjoyed hanging at the beach and took many long walks. The weather was in the 70's every day (they say we lucked out) People at the desk were very nice and went above and beyond one day to assist our guests from LA with a parking issue. The restaurant next door was great. We enjoyed our stay so much and look forward to returning in the future. The sooner the better!!! We were not happy with the hotel that we booked so we drove over to Pacific Beach, CA to look for a beachside hotel. This was Thanksgiving week so I wasn't sure we would be able to find something. Beach Cottages was able to give us a great room with a ocean view for a good price. Comfy beds. We stayed in the room for 3 days then switched to a beach side cottage.(also a great price) We loved being able to step out of our room and have our feet in the sand. The nights were chilly by the beach, so the heater was welcome. Next time we will eat out less and make use of the large cottage kitchen. The staff was really helpful. They have books, puzzles and games in the lobby to use. Very relaxed and funky area. I loved having a Bloody Mary beachside next door at the Green Flash. Looking forward to next year. If you are expecting the Ritz go somewhere else. But if you want a great fun location, clean rooms and old school California ambience, come here. We have been visiting for years and hesitate telling more people only because we want to keep it to ourselves. It is not fancy, no huge screen TVs, room service, etc. But what it does have is soul. You feel it the moment you arrive. Ping pong tables for the kids, outdoor grills for the whole family, laundry and walking distance to grocery stores (if your lucky enough to get a cabin that has a kitchen). And then, of course, there are clothing stores, surf shops and bike rentals if you are into that sort of thing. And then there is the beach and the boardwalk: directly in front of the place. Its busy and people watching central, so have fun with it! Make coffe in your room, or go get it at any of the number of really hip places around. Or pour some wine, then walk on the beach and let your cares melt away. All the while knowing your family is having fun too... The Beach Cottages is one of the best places to stay for families who want a San Diego beach vacation. We have stayed in both the cottages and motel rooms and have enjoyed both. Not having to fight for a parking space just to go to the beach is fantastic, the kids can run back to the room to use the restroom or get a snack, and, in the case of my husband, he can go back for a nap. A grocery store is nearby to pick up all the food you'll need for your stay. The Beach Cottages has several barbecues for grilling and patio tables to enjoy eating outside every night. If you're tired of the sand and water (but really, who would be?) they have ping pong and shuffleboard in the courtyard. Get your reservations in early in the year as they fill up fast. My family and I have been goin to the beach cottages for about 35 years, every year in July we always look forward to going, we have barbeques, play ping pong tournaments, go meet new people, as well go to SeaWorld and Belmont Park, which is a great local theme park. The service is great as well , and restaurants near by are great to eat, My favorite restaurant Konos just down the boardwalk near Crystal Pier and right next door is the Green Flash, great service. For anyone to relax and have fun at the beach I recommend going to the Beach Cottages This hotel is an older, refurbished building, with several off shoots to the main building. We had the misfortune of staying in an annex located in an alley surrounded by bars. It is a VERY busy and extremely noisey location. The room was older but large, slept 5 comfortably, but the beds were very hard and the carpet was filthy. The room had a nice size stocked kitchen with a bar and a large dining room table. There is no air conditioning, which I am very glad it was only in the high 60's cause it got pretty stuffy in the late afternoon, and you would not dare leave the sliding glass door open at night, as we were in an alley with all types of actvitiy, homeless people sleeping in the bushes, people smoking pot and lots of intoxicated individuals. The last night we had several people banging on our door at 3:30 in the am. The average age in this particular block was around 19 years old. It felt more like spring break in Rocky Point Mexico. On a positive note....the beach was just a very short block away, and you could see the waves from the balcany. I stayed 5 nights in a 3rd floor motel room that directly looked out onto the beach and cottage overtop the cottages. It was a superb view. The room was very nice although slightly on the small side. Some of the fixtures were older but still in good condition. The staff was very accomodating. The room had a refrigerator and microwave, and there is a Ralph's grocery store diaganally across the street. The beach out in front of the hotel and the neighborhood in general tends to draw a younger crowd. There is a place just down the ocean walk called Kono's that has a very good breakfast at a very good price (it also has a long line but is worth the wait). Overall very happy with the hotel. We rented one of the ocean front, 2-bedroom cottages (#513) for 2 nights and then switched to a non-oceanfront cottage (#519) for our third night since the oceanfront wasn't available. The first cottage was much smaller and older (worn wooden floors, older refrigerator) but had a great view of the ocean out of the front window. The second cottage had nice tiled floors and a larger updated kitchen, a larger living room and much larger bedrooms. The ocean was still visible out the livingroom window. My husband and I were travelling with our two young children and my mother and the oceanfront cottage was a bit cramped even though it can accommodate 6. If I had known the difference in the size of the places I would have chose to stay in the non-oceanfront, 2-bedroom cottage because of the extra space. Both places had a great patio/seating area outside the front door and easy access to the beach.",,,
JohnnyAsbestos,234878,"You will always get what you pay for. This hostel cost me 36 Euro a night. The room was small had 6 beds in it, but was clean and tidy. It was secure. Even though 6 beds 36 euro offered the whole room. Ideal for a family, or students or even a business traveller coming to the end of the financial year. Car parking is difficult, but I've stayed there three timers and always manged to park on tempelhofer ufer, right outside! Ideally placed for technischer museum, potsdammer platz and 200 yards from Markischer Halles / GleisDriecke. Breakfast is a bit of a free for all is school parties are staying. Excellent hotel on KDamm not 5 mins walk fro Zoologische Garten S Bahn / U Bahn. Right in the centre of Berlin's theatreland, with dozens of small restaurants nearby. My Favourites are on SavignyPlatz on KantStrasse which is just behind the hotel. [BREL ( Bistro), Mar y Sol ( Spanish) and San Marino (Italian) and the Risacher Wein restaurant] 5 mins from Zoo 30mins from Brandenburger Tor Right on top of the U2 which will get you to Potsdammer Platz in 10 minutes. The hotel is spotlessly clean with a nice bar for evening drinks etc. The rooms were excellent, clean and well furnished. Breakfast was excellent, typically German but with the Berlin tradition of Kuechen as well, which sweet toothed colleague devoured. I had a room in front of hotel and bearing it was on a main road, was vcery quiet. Satellite TV covers most regions. Walk in rate was about 120 Euros, though I paid only 80 after having a little haggle. This is a really nice hotel in the wrong place! However itis a lot cheaper than hotels with a bospheros vew. It is only 5 mins walk away, but the view fro this hotel is much more pedestrian. However the staff are really good, in spite of my key not working every time the bell hop always opened the door for me. bereakfast is typical of the region, very enjoyable too. Rooms at front of house are a little noisy, traffic and Muezzin too! Otherwise good value and not far from local suk with plenty of good value restaurants. This hotel is big, clean, and slap bang on the A-Platz. Ideal for travelling to other parts of the city, just 500m from Hackescher Marky and 800m from the museum Insel. Enjoy the city from this excellent location. The rooms seem quite small and under air conditioned, but offer excellent views across the city and the Fenser Turm. Looking from my window, and using my 8x12 binos, i looked from the F-Turm to U-d-Linden, the Brandenburger Tor, Golden Elsie and right through to the Funk-Turm out the other side of the city. To the N was the humbolds Park Flak-Turm. Its an excellent Radisson hotel, run in the best traditions of being very comfortable but expensive. A 2 night stay cost me 280 Euro for a double room inc breakfast.","Definitely a good choice - the double room was absolutely huge and the bed was really comfortable. The hotel is located close to the underground transport system and the location is perfect for easy access to other parts of this wonderful city. I did not eat breakfast here so I can't comment on the food but the staff were helpful enough (if a little cold) and the hotel amenities were perfect for what we wanted on this sightseeing city break - a clean, spacious rom with a comfortable bed and a hot shower in a suitable location. Will definitely stay here again when I return to Berlin. From checkin to checkout this hotel exceeded our expectations. The location was perfest, the room was perfect, the breakfast was perfect, the staff were good. The rate included breakfast and the breakfast had it all: eggs, both scrambled and hard boiled, bacon, fruit, cereal, good coffee etc. The underground train was 100 meters from the door and you can go anywhere in Berlin with it. The Hard Rock was across the street and there were resaurants everywhere. We aren't great shoppers but there were stores everywhere to take your money. We took a hop on hop off tour and found it worthwhile. The checkpoint charlie museum highlited the desperation of that era. For the price we paid 55 euro a nite it was a special 4 star hotel Pleasant stay, spacious warm rooms. decor very dated but priced appropriately. Nice staff, fab breakfast â¬10 not too bad a price. We've been there for six days and the location and everything was ok in my room; however, this was not the case with the other party's room, where hymidity was holding a party! Seemed like a former communist house turned into a youth hostel and not a 4 star hotel. There are two underground stations nearby, within walking distance, which is truly helpful but consider staying in another hotel if a renovation doesn't take place immediately! The banquet breakfast was fantastic and tasty (besides the tomatoes) and the personnel were helpful, friendly and smiling and gave you a sense of safety - a big plus - they even allowed us an earlier check in a later check out - which was greatly appreciated. They even kept an eye on our luggages on our departure day which was of a great help. Furthermore, they handed free copies of Berlin maps and overall they were quite polite. I mean everybody. The building, on the other hand, is quite old, with a steady smell of old carpets and quite a few stains on it as well! I would recommend the hotel for its location - especially if you are planning to be in the city most of the day, or if you travel alone but not suggested if you are planning a romantic getaway! This hotel is in a super convenient location with airport bus just outside and excellent bus, U-bahn and S-bahn connections within a minute or two from the hotel. I believe the hotel is undergoing a much needed face-lift, if the standard of our room is anything to go by. Ancient, grotty wardrobe and tired old bathroom. Light years away from a 4-star standard. Other rooms we happened to catch a glance of seemed more modern. No internet connection in the room, only wireless network available in the lobby for 5 Euro a day. Not impressed. The breakfast however was sensational and the staff very friendly and helpful. In short: Great location, excellent breakfast, friendly staff, disappointing room. This hotel at very good location, for a good price. You don't even need to walk and there's lots of shops, cafes, restaurants, transport etc. The room was fairly spacious for a solo traveller, well designed, and the bed particularly comfortable. My room was on the front of the hotel and I had a lovely view of the main street. The breakfast was a typical continental breakfast but was of good quality. No air conditioning, very hot rooms. Unable to open windows due to traffic noise. Hotel neded a renovation. The hotel has an excellent location, the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfasts are very good with lots of choice. The rooms and corridors, however, are shabby and years overdue for refurbishment. It is definitely not 4* standard, if the hotel is not careful it could get done if it continues to claim 4* status. Four nights here over a party weekend in Berlin. It was a little away from the action (my travel companion had booked it) but close to the U-Bahn and walkable to everything we needed. The breakfast was quite nice but had its irritations too (the urn for hot water was always empty, and indicating the fact to staff didn't seem to help with getting it topped up - I ended up filling it myself from the bottled water on the buffet). No internet access in the rooms - you have to pay for it and to go downstairs to the lobby area. The hotel is tired and in need of a refurb (it has a metal key of the last-century variety - not ideal when you have two people sharing but coming and going independently). The plumbing seemed to clog up and the room had poor ventilation and seeming had heating stuck on (it wasn't that hot in Berlin but the room seemed very warm). I wouldn't have picked this place, and found it more than a little disappointing. The hotel was very nice, I loved the arquitecture and the receptionists were very nice. However, they did not disclose the fact that there was no internet access in the rooms (only in public areas and for a cost of 5 additional euros a day). Also, the room I got was soooo far away in the back, I got two single separated beds and the room had back/low view so I could hear every time someone was going to the parking lot or when the train (S-bahn Zoo) passed (basically every 6 minutes). Besides that, it's pretty well located, surrounded by shops and restaurants and really close access to the U-bahn and S-bahn. Very nice walks. Also, it has great room service and a lovely mini-bar. Ideal for a couple of nights leisure break when you are spending your own money, however if you expect a business class hotel re-adjust your expectations. Great centrally located property right opposite The Hard Rock Cafe, great for shopping and a nice local German cuisine restaurant in the road opposite (Gasthaus Krombach). Room was a good size and wrapped around the lift shaft (605)........... Fortunately the lift was not working to the 6th floor so we were not able to hear the lift mechanism....... There is an atrium lounge area but no manned bar, reception staff serve drinks as required..... The traffic and nightlife is very noisy and there is no aircon so with the windows open we had to wear earplugs to sleep........ You will definately need the windows open as the weather gets warmer so pack earplugs or opt for a room that faces away from the road to aid sleep.... Overall a good hotel for the money......

Walk in rate was about 120 Euros, though I paid only 80 after having a little haggle. good location is the only advantage. old hotel, terrible bathroom. unfriendly reception staff ! ask for a nonsmoking room, i got a horribly room smelling of tobacco. We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. Breakfast was excellent - plenty of choice each day. Bed linen, towels etc very clean. Location was great - right opposite city-tour bus stop, near trains. We were given a non-smoking room as requested. I had requested a double bed, but we ended up with twin beds. We did ask to change, but was told there was no way we could be changed to a double. Main thing that bothered us was that there was no kettle or coffee making facility in the room. Would have been nice to go back to a cuppa at the end of a busy day sightseeing! Overall though, would definitely stay here again. The hotel has great location and value, but it is worn. However it's clean and breakfast was good. Biggest drawback was the absence of internet access which nearly ruined my business trip. I had a problem with the bed in my room, and it was fixed very efficiently. We stayed at Hotel Zoo for three days/nights and were very satisfied with the hotel. The location at KurfÃ¼rstendamm is very good, the staff is friendly and the rate was very reasonable and included a great breakfast. We will not hesitate to book a stay at Hotel Zoo the next time we visit Berlin. Originally booked from 12-16 April 2010 but thanks to all the flight cancellations due to the volcano in Iceland stayed until until 20th. The hotel is ideally located for getting about and seeing Berlin. It is only a couple of minutes walk from Zoo Station which provides rail links to just about anywhere you may need to go. The is a U Bahn station practically outside the hotel as well as a local bus stop. There is no shortage of good shops and restaurants within walking distance, in fact the more you explore the more you find. On the street opposite there is a first class traditional German bar/restaurant on the left hand side of the street, the first one that you will pass. Breakfast at the hotel is first class and will set you up for the day. We cannot praise the reception staff enough. Given the travel chaos at the time they could not have been more helpful. Great semi-luxury hotel. Great helpful staff, great breakfast, and great rooms. Two zinks! ;-) Super location near metro and right on the KurfÃ¼rstendamm.",,,
Neal R,2515502,"The food and food service are excellent. A very comfortable, calm and relaxing atmosphere. A very good value. The food and food service are excellent. A very comfortable, calm and relaxing atmosphere. A very good value.","The food and food service are excellent. A very comfortable, calm and relaxing atmosphere. A very good value. We stayed two nights here. The bed was comfortable and the hotel well-kept. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast buffets and two complimentary cocktails at the onsite restaurant. The food there was excellent and the bartender sociable and hard-working. The hot tub was nice and warm and the pool appeared clean. The only drawback was the foulest smelling elevator we have ever ridden in. We chose to climb to the third floor to avoid it. I stayed in this hotel a week on a business trip. The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and there was a good wired internet. When I arrive at the evening, the bed was put down a a chocolate was waiting for me. Sometime I did use the WiFi for my Smartphone. No problems with it, although some peers did complain about the WiFi. For some people it is bad, but for me no problem: The bar closes at 22:00 I do need to say that when one is having a room at the inner yard, one will hear the noise from the pool and the bar in my room. So for an intercontinental traveller trying to go bed early after a long flight, it is not very silent. Although the closing at 22:00 contributes on silence around 22:30. The pool itself is nice. When going back to San Diego, I might return to this hotel. I stayed at this hotel for business purposes over a very long extended period of time, adding up to several months in total, so it really is a home away from home. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The staff here are super friendly and always went out of their way to accommodate us, make our stay easier and better. I have rarely seen such good service anywhere! The rooms are nice and spacious with all the basics that you need while travelling. The pool in the middle with the palm trees around really remind you that you are now in California. The location is probably not ideal for holiday travelers because it's quite far from most attractions, but perfect for business trips to the many business parks in the area. The restaurant is really good.. especially for breakfasts! If you get tired of the hotel restaurant there are a ton of other good restaurants nearby that the friendly free shuttle can take you to. Being in the hotel industry I know a good hotel when I see one. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. We stayed here for two nights and had the best time. Employees go above and beyond to ensure you are satisfied. Everyone was smiling and willing to answer any questions we had. Johnathan at the front desk was very personable and even helped us out with directions to his favorite local beaches and restaurants. The gym is small but had everything needed for a great workout. The pool area was nice- My only complaint is that is closes pretty early (9pm). The complimentary breakfast and drinks were awesome! The room was clean and huge. I can't wait to go back! I had the opportunity to attend a very dear friends wedding this weekend at the Radisson. I must say the rooms were spacious, the pool was fantastic and the breakfast that is included is among the best I have experienced. The event staff did a wonderful job with the layout, spacing and food for the wedding / reception. The hotel is an easy on / off to I-15, gas stations and local restaurants as well. Thanks for the great job....keep it up. - Extremely good shuttle service always available. - Good room service - Cozy restaurant with a smiley service - Decent gym - Bad (not ergonomic at working desk chair) - Good breakfast - Nice looking pool area when it is warmer weather I just booked one day for fun and participated one of radisson's promotion. Arriving at this hotel at late night, I still found it was a beautiful place. The lobby was decorated with Christmas tree so it was very like home. The front staff that night was very helpful. As a silver member, I was upgraded to business class. The room was very good and comfortable. Big Sofa, good space and everywhere clean. The room equipped with three-in-one printer, iHome, very good for business and leisure traveler. I have to emphases that the internet speed was pretty good!! It could be called REAL HIGH-SPEED INTERNET. They offer complimentary hot breakfast. Both the quality and environment was pretty good. Food was delicious. There is one thing I confused but the front desk didn't answer me well. I booked through radisson.com and prepaid my night. I asked for a receipt but the front desk told me, my booking was made through a travel agency. Finally, she gave me the receipt, I checked the account was exactly the same as I paid. Could manager help answer this? We stayed here for 2 nights. It was not as nice as I had expected based on the reviews I read on trip advisor. We had a king bed with a pullout couch. There was just one tv and it swiveled between the couch area and the bed. It had an adjustable sleep number bed. It squeaked loudly when we rolled over. We could hear the shower running in the rooms that bordered our room very clearly which woke my kids up a few times. All of the rooms had big windows that bordered the outside hallway like a motel. In the morning we were woken up by people talking outside our room. The breakfast was pretty good (bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes,toast, juice, coffee). They allowed us to check in a little early which we very much appreciated. A lot of security guards roaming around which made us a bit nervous about the clientele. All in all, it was just ok. I had a short 1 night stay, but it was excellent for the price that I paid. In the end, including taxes, the cost was approximately $100. The room itself was really pretty nice for what I needed. It was spacious with a separate living area and bedroom area, not separate rooms but divided by a partial wall and TV. The bed was really big and very comfortable with a nice comforter and plenty of pillows. The bathroom was very clean and was fully stocked with overnight amenities (shampoos, soaps, etc.). The shower also had one of those bowed curtain rods that pulls the shower curtain away from the user, which I love. There wasn't really anything to complain about, but I the desk chair and couch seemed a little dated. Regarding customer service, the front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful both with check-in and when I phoned in to make my reservation. If I had a reason to stay overnight in this area again, I would definitely come back here. I had a short 5 day stay. Missed the pool, but it looked clean, well kept. Room was v clean..But hated the huge 40 inch Big Box TV, which worked like crap. The morning breakfast had very good, choice. The evening complimentary drink too was nice...The only thing I hated was at 12:30 midnight, everyday the wireless internet would stop working, and wouldn't be fixed till 7am next day. $100 corp price was pretty worth it. We stayed at this hotel for a vacation in San Diego. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and well maintained, buffet breakfast was good. Complimentary wireless internet connection was great. We didn't use the pool althogh it was clean and tempting. The only drawback was lack of safe in the room. The hotel was mediocre at best. The room were typical for a 2-3 star hotel. I spent two nights there for work and I got a decent night sleep -- they offer sleep number beds. The staff was friendly and did their best to make my trip confortable I stayed at this hotel while interviewing for a job. I learned at check-in, that although the company had made all the arrangements, I was to pay for the room and expense it. The front desk staff was very understanding, and gave me a much better nightly rate than the reservation price. The rooms all have outdoor entrances, and the area around the hotel is not threatening by any means. There is at least 1 security guard that roams the parking lot area during the night time hours. The free breakfast buffet was limited in selection, but cooked perfectly. I had an early flight out and arrived for breakfast 10 minutes before opening time. I was invited in for coffee, and offered some muffins to go if I desired them. The hot items were available just before opening at 6am, and the staff let me know that it was okay for me to help myself. The sleep number bed was a new experience, but honestly, I could not find a ""perfect setting"" as shown on the commercials. None the less, it was comfortable enough for two good nights of sleep. The room was quiet, but I was located on the outside area that faces the parking lot, not the pool. A newspaper was at my door on the first morning, but not on check-out day. My receipt was slipped under the door sometime before I woke up at 5am. The room was clean and well maintained. Although I had a coupon for a free cocktail each night, I was too busy both days to use it. Overall, it rates a solid 4. The employees here are so friendly and helpful. There is a buffet breakfast in the morning that is decent. Not realizing that it ended at 9am, we arrived late, but they just put more plates and food out for us! The pool is heated and decent. Rooms were clean and well maintained. Only drawback is the distance to a lot of the attractions in San Diego.",,,
ABdeMH,298401,"Yes, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s a stunning view from any bedroom (improves slightly as the room number decreases and the floor levels increase). Certainly I spent ten days here and never tired of looking over the busy stretch of water round that Ã¢â¬ÅcoathangerÃ¢â¬ï¿½ bridge. But the hotel is also conveniently next to a station only a couple of stops from the heart of Sydney. A more scenic route is to walk straight down from the hotel to Lavender Bay and along the waterfront to the ferry at MilsomÃ¢â¬â¢s Point. North Sydney is quieter than central Sydney, but there is a good choice of restaurants and shops nearby and towards McMahonÃ¢â¬â¢s Point. All that and the efficient, welcoming staff made for a more relaxing stay in the City than IÃ¢â¬â¢d expected. The rooms were clean, well stocked and everything worked. The only drawback was having to pay for the internet, which is oh, so yesterday. However, the bonus for me was the hotelÃ¢â¬â¢s free access to the nearby Olympic Pool (50 metre, heated, open air, laned swimming pool). This hotel is definitely a great base from which to visit the Sydney essentials. This is a prestigious hotel â its trim low level buildings are spread over a large well kept site. The style â Frank Lloyd Wrightâs â may not be to everyoneâs taste but it is faithfully adhered to down to the last detail. I was attending one of the many conferences referred to in other reviews and knew what to expect: clinically efficient staff and a reasonable choice of different dining facilities. The pool facilities are a bonus and the choice of beers there much wider than I expected. But the rooms havenât changed since I was last here 4 years ago and seem basic compared to what now constitutes 5 star hotels globally. Even a no-star B&B in the UK will lay on free self-serve tea/coffee facilities, and most top hotels Iâve stayed in have a CD player in the room, though I suspect their walls between rooms are thicker than here. That said, it was handy to have a set of scales in the bathroom, even if they only registered in lbs, and an Ethernet connection for oneâs laptop. This is a great location for a conference. So, if your companyâs paying, then lie back and enjoy.","Yes, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s a stunning view from any bedroom (improves slightly as the room number decreases and the floor levels increase).

Stayed here many times-great proximity to North Sydney IT companies if travelling on business.Excellent in-house restaurant and bar. Easy access to harbour and North Sydney pool and jogging tracks if you need exercise. Once you have stayed at the Harbour View Hotel in Sydney, you won't wish to stay anywhere else. Fantastic accommodation, showcasing Sydney at its finest - this place is a hidden treasure! It is perfect proximity to North Sydney trains, Circular Quay, Blue's Point Rd, incredible restaurants, and anything you could ever hope to make a Sydney trip complete. The view is like being in a constantly moving picture of thriving, cosmopolitan activity (or an episode of Ferry Boat Fred) - which you have to peel yourself away from to experience the delights of the surrounding area. It's equally hard to peel away from the exceptionally comfortable bedding, the Blue's Bar and in-house restuarant to get out and about! In the words of the great Molly Meldrum, ""do yourself a favour"" and stay at the Harbour View Hotel. If the sound of trains concerns you, just bring ear plugs - simple!!",,,
irish-mumbai,653850,"We booked this hotel from Mumbai after cancelling the other one provided by our tour agent: since the reviews I read for the hotel forced me to do so. We checked in on 16 Feb evening, traveling with 4 friends, as soon as we reached Ali greeted us with a big smile and got the luggage transferred. we booked one twin and a triple, but couldn't find a triple as we learnt they have same size room available ie; a double bed and a single, room size just ok, ne ways we managed. Next morning made our stay memorable as it started snowing, wonderful atmosphere, great views from roof top. All sights Blue mosque, Hagia sophia, Topkapi palace , cistern, within walking reach.The hotel reminds and give us a charm of an old world, best location in Sultanahmet.Free wi-fi really helped staying connected. But one regret about breakfast, nor continental, American or Indian, only salads, bread and cheese might be turkish. On our request they made us omlettes which we relished on.. Ali and Alp is 24/7 front of the desk for guidance, may it be for a mobile simcard, night club ,a restaurant or sight seeing... Overall I would not mind staying here again... Stayed at this hotel during vacation, with wife and two kids, apartment size is pretty decent, neat bathroom, toilet accessories always missing, have to call everytime for soap towels and other toileteries. I booked this from mumbai for 5 nights 10 nov to 15 nov, on 12 I got a notice from conceirge that you will have to check out on 12th, I went down to reception and handed over booking vouchers. However it was bugging to receive another notice on the door to check-out on 13th due to which I had heated arguements with the lobby manager, later resolved.. buffet breakfast was typically same every morning but ok.. in short Le-Meridians Dar al Sandos is a decent apartment suites with confused and annoying staff.. Location wise good.. Suitable for Families and holidayers... On our trip back from Istanbul, we had 4 nights stopover in Dubai.. still wondering why didn't I changed this Hotel before arriving. Nothing special to mention, as soon as you approach near you are welcomed by hordes of prosts... A dilapidated property, outdated amenities, old rooms, empty mini-bar, no tea-coffee maker, breakfast with Indian menu was just average.. above all dance bars and night club will make the rest of your time as you wish...choose between sleep or party the whole night....strictly no for businessmen, families or I would not even recommend leisure travelers...","On our trip back from Istanbul, we had 4 nights stopover in Dubai.. still wondering why didn't I changed this Hotel before arriving.

I have stayed at the Astoria Hotel in Dubai on at least fifteen occasions, all on business travel. The rooms are good, the food tasty and they will always make me something of my choice and to my taste off the standard menu, the staff friendly and helpful and the location convenient for my work, and for an evening stroll past the shops in the area. On my last two trips to Dubai, I made the mistake of staying at a supposedly more luxurious hotel suggested by my agent. Big mistake. The warmth, friendliness, efficiency and service of the Astoria was missing from the 'luxury' hotel. For sure, I will be staying at the Astoria on all my future trips to Dubai. I had stayed in Astoria in Sept 2011.My experience was very very good.The good part of the hotel is ,it is centrally located.You don't have to go elsewhere for shopping,because everything is near by walking distance.Food is excellent.What i saw in the hotel was it was full & mostly Gujarati families were staying.Whereas i had heard that the hotel is not good for families.But seeing all the families staying,especially Gujarati families,i am thinking of taking my family in my next visit.Staffs are good & supportive.Breakfast is very good.BEST HOTEL IN UAE in 3* category.Once in a lifetime who must visit Astoria Hotel. This hotel is one of the worse hotel i have stayed in so far in terms of facilities and a good night sleep. FIrst thing i saw when i entered the room was it was out dated, looked very cold. Next thing i saw was cockroach in my bed. I killed 5 with in 10 mins of entering the room. I called the reception only to be told they couldnt do anything as it was already too late and they were full. Third my room was on the second floor and there was a dance club on the 1st floor which is opens till 3:30 in the morning. I couldnt sleep @ all and it was really annoying especially when i have to wake up @ 6 in the morning. When i complained the next day they said the room hadnt been in use for a while so therefore had cockroaches in.. how disgusting... and the staff werent ready to move my room but when i argued that i work in hotel myself they moved me to the 3rd floor but still could hear all the noise from the club. The staff would not move my parents room either so i had to stay on the 3rd floor when my parents were on 1st for entire journey. Breakfast had no option other than indian buffet everyday. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone unless all you want to do there is stay in the club till its open that is 3 in the morning. The only good thing about this hotel is the bell boys are very helpful. Stayed in Astoria for more than a week. The location in the Bur Dubai is perfect, in the middle of lively small streets and close to the bus station and the new Green Metro Line stations. The neighbourhood is very safe, full of shops and restaurants, and does not become ""dead"" in the evening as the areas with colossal new office buildings and malls often do. The service in the hotel was always very friendly and our standard room on the fourth floor was quiet and comfortable. I can imagine that in the floor just above the disco earplugs would be required. The breakfast in the Indian restaurant was tasty (if you like Indian food) and had both veg and non-veg alternatives. A safety box was provided at no cost, but the Internet (wlan) cost 20 dirhams per hours actually used. No swimming pool but we didn't need it anyway. My husband & I traveled to Dubai and stayed at Astoria Hotel for 5 days in December 2011. This was not our choice but referred by our travel agent. As such I made a quick search about the hotel reviews on this site. I was worried after reading the comments! Anyway the travel agent recommended it and also as our intention was to explore Dubai and not spend much time in the hotel we decided to go ahead with it. I must say I do not agree with some of the earlier reviews, as we did not hear any noise from the Disco and slept well (we were on the 3rd floor)! It had all facilities that is usually offered in these type of hotels. The room was good, clean and it remained that way throughout our stay. The breakfast of course was not that good as it was almost the same menu everyday without any variation. The staff was friendly and helped us with arranging various sight seen tours. Wifi facility is there however it is not free of charge. The best thing about the hotel is the location!!!!! It is 5 minutes away to the nearest Metro station from there you could go to all Malls starting from Iban Batuta, Mall of Emirates (where Ski Dubai/Snow park is), Burj Kalifa/Dubai Mall (where the ice skating, acquarium and sound & light water show happen) if you purchase an unlimited day pass costing 16 AED. Also the water taxi station to cross the Dubai creek (on the other side you get the famous gold souk, spice souk & perfume souk with a fare of 1 AED) is also 5 minutes walk. A branch of Careefour Supermarket is also in the neighborhood. The Dubai museum, a film theater (mostly screen Tamil) and shops (wholesale /retail with bargain prices) for computers, phones, etc and many eating places are all around the hotel. The Ambassador Hotel (of the same group) is a hop step away and they have a variety of pubs and a swimming pool. The hotel even allowed us a very late checkout so that we could shop more till we were dropped at the airport. It is about 30 minutes away from the airport. It was its location in meena bazaar in old Dubai that made us choose this hotel. Because it is quite old building, hence was devoid of latest amenities. The room service and house keeping were hopeless and even no toilet accessories was provided. But the breakfast buffet was a pleasure to see with great choice of veg and non veg cuisines in the menu. its nice to stay at this hotel for business trip and singles. Location is perfect because its surrounded by shops and restaurents. worst experience ever! there is a night club on the 1st floor of the hotel and every night until 2.30 am we couldnt sleep as the music was incredibly loud. when we found out the first night they gaves a new room (we were on the 3rd floor and they moved us to the 4th - top floor). the following night we still couldnt sleep and they were even kidding us saying ""why are you complaining?the music is so nice!!"". they were of course earning a lot of money from the night club so they didnt care about the guests who had already paid for the room. so we didnt rest for all the holiday. the hotel was also dirty, breakfast time, tables were not clean and they were filling plastic bottles of water pretending it was mineral, but was just tap water. they also write on various websites that there is a swimming pool, which it is not true!!!! AWFUL EXPERIENCE! DONT GO!!!!! A neat, cultured hotel. Situated at prime location( very near to Bar-Dubai bus stand). Rooms are clean. But room service needs some more professionalism. I think in budget 3* this is the best you can get around in bur dubai with access to malls,creek,RTA,meena bazaar right in front.With in hotel bars which is a must for visitors in dubai as there are no wine shops outside.Rooms are good,plenty of families travelling.stayed for a week from 13 to 19 sept.Overall a good stay. A very well known hotel for its loaction and night life facilities within premises. Recently came up with strange rules which makes it awkward for a business traveller to stay, work and enjoy together. I have stayed here many times before but can say that standard is getting deteriorated and it is no more worth what you are paying as the interiors, amenities, ambience all are age old. This hotel is really wonderful....the reception staff is really helpful and they were polite as well..... the main attraction of this hotel is 3 bars... really great.... enjoyed a lot.... tgit rocks... great quality and hassel free network, this hotel is great for friends company.... solo travellers.... and good for families..... and not to forget..... indian breakfast is really great and hot.... have stayed at this hotel on many occassions...adequate hotel for single travellers, decent rooms, good indian food, co operative staff...& various options to spend your evenings...they hv in house pub, bar , indian restaurant with live music & indian dance bar... This Hotel is first on my list of hotels not to stay in future! And you will decide this the minute you enter it the hotel. Poorly lit lobby with worn out interiors welcomed us. The room and resturant was just average, which appeared like a jail, with bars on windows. The beds were worn out, with very average room service. The bathroom was just about ok. And worst was that it was kind of a pick up spot. Something not too much to enjoy. Did not like it at all. Nothing special to speak about the room and service...Its quite average....you cant expect more for this price at Dubai...The best thing about the hotel is its location.....the lightings in the entire area is poor and TGIT ..Its meant for pick up....there is more pick up than the sale of any drinks full of eastern europeans searching for their prey...please avoid if you're on family trip. else its worth for money",,,
cherryiice,579046,"I don't know that I could afford to stay here during the season, but if I can, this will certainly be my go-to place. Came down for a weekend in april and was very impressed. Its difficult to find good hotels in OC, the majority are outdated, run down and dirty. That was not the case at all at the Holiday Inn Express. We got a suite and were so happy with it. Everything was very clean and I especially loved how they no longer use those awful bedspreads that you always hear about never being washed, they now use all white sheets with a white blanket in between, so you know for a fact youre the first person touching it. And so soft! Ive never stayed at a hotel that had sheets as soft as mine at home, but these definitely were. The one downside to our room was that there was no balcony. Other than that, it was lovely, I actually counted and our suite had 7 different mirrors in it! The breakfast was okay, good selection, but the eggs werent so great and the muffins were a bit dry... The cinnamon rolls are to die for however. Never made it to the pool or hot tub but absolutely loved the jacuzzi tub in our bathroom! The people at the front desk were incredibly friendly and helpful, I dont think Ive ever experienced such friendly service in OC either. I guess it depends on how high your standards are, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed with my stay at this motel. My ex (who was pretty cheap with pretty low standards) did not seem bothered by it however. The rooms were not as clean as I would have liked, and were incredibly unattractive. The tv in our room was broken, and so we had to be moved to a different room upon discovery of this fact. What bothered me the most, however, was the service. Not only were the people in charge completely unbothered by any of the problems brought to their attention, they were also completely unmotivated to make up for the inconveniences experienced. And when I needed an extra blanket in the middle of the night, I was S.O.L, because the front desk is completely unmanned from 11pm to 6am and no one answers the number posted on the door. The situation would have to be pretty desperate to convince me to stay here again. I was very impressed with my stay at the Sea Bay hotel this summer. After doing a lot of research, I determined that the Sea Bay was by far the best choice within our price range. And I was not disappointed. I stayed in the Kings Arms Motel in 2009 and paid about $40 less per night for that crap hole place. The Sea Bay is not perfect, but its a nice hotel and it met all of my expectations. When I made our reservations, I got a deal for a free breakfast for both myself and my boyfriend for each night that we stayed. The free breakfast actually turned out to be an $8 voucher per person for use in the new hotel cafe. I was impressed with the quality of the food at the cafe (the fresh fruit was actually fresh!) and while we went over our $8 vouchers both days, you can easily get a decent breakfast while staying within those limits. Another concern I had when booking was the actual quality of the rooms. I knew that the hotel had two buildings, and that we had booked in the slightly older building, building B. A lot of times hotels will only show photos of their nicer rooms, leading to disappointment when you realize that these are not the rooms you booked. But our room was just as nice as the rooms in the photos and the only complaint I can make is that it was slightly smaller than expected. The staff was very friendly, and there was always someone at the desk in case of any late night issues. I loved that there were two pools, although both were small, it was nice to have a choice. My only real complaint would be the quality of the sheets, they were definitely some of the rougher sheets I've encountered in a hotel. Overall, I was very impressed with my stay at Sea Bay Hotel, and I look forward to staying there in the future.","A friend and I along with a total of 4 kids stayed for 2 nights and found the manager and staff to be extremely rude and unpleasant. The lady even yelled at a friend of ours who stopped by to chat and told her to go home now and that she couldn't sit at the pool unless we paid for her. The rooms were not great, smelled and were very dark. Even the main lobby area was so mildew smelling that I had to cover my nose when we walked in. The only thing nice about the place was the pool and I think it was only because it was so hot! I would never stay in this motel ever again. Not only did the manager ruin our first few days of vacation, but the accommodations were terrible! When we got to the Kings Arms we immediately realized how small the room were. Then the kids were running all around the room and then sat on the bed and I saw their feet. They were BLACK! The carpets are extremely disgusting! The bathrooms are cleaned daily but u would never have known it. I think it is because the place has not been updated ina really long time. Also if u stay here please make sure you bring your own towels and wash cloths!! They give you ones that are paper thin and don't smell the best. I probably would recommend this place to a very young couple without children or a single young person. I couldn't get my kids to understand the concept that they had to wear their shoes in the room. There was also no where to hang up your beach towels and if u did hang them up in the restroom they didn't dry. Don't ask for anything extra or you might have the person from the desk at your door. Also do not take your laptop expecting to be able to access the internet. There are no directions and they say they have wireless internet and tell you how to get on it in another language. I am very computer savvy and I could not figure out how to use it. I thankfully brought my aircard on the trip. Also make sure you have a cell phone because there are no phones in the rooms. I have never in my life stayed at a motel where there was no phone in the room. I personally didn't feel comfortable having no phone in the room. The pool opens in the morning late and closes in the morning early. I just felt like the owners were constantly watching ur every move. I can understand that you probably get all kinds of people but u shouldn't run away new customers due to past bad experiences. But again, you get what you pay for. The beds are so uncomfortable and u will have to see ur chiropractor upon return. But other than that, the location itself is wonderful!! I guess it depends on how high your standards are, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed with my stay at this motel. My ex (who was pretty cheap with pretty low standards) did not seem bothered by it however. The rooms were not as clean as I would have liked, and were incredibly unattractive.

psage728,82150,"I visited family in Sherman Oaks and researched the area for a hotel with an ADA accessible room with roll in shower (wheel-chair) for other family members coming from NY. The hotel staff and concierge -Donald- were very patient with all my phone calls and questions. The ADA room has 2 queens and big bathroom with bars and the roll-in shower with fold down seat.

Rooms have a balcony with interesting views of the mountains and freeways, doors are sealed for safety and noise reduction. Nice pool/spa area with fire pit and tables.

We really liked this hotel--comfortable, clean, attractive, quiet. I would stay there again for sure. A little old, noisey A/C and the TV only picked up Analog stations. Stayed overnight at the Courtyard at Sherman Oaks on Oscar weekend, when everything in Hollywood and the Westside seemed to be booked. The rooms are a little small but very clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds. Double glass doors kept out 95% of the racket from the Ventura Freeway screaming along eight stories below. The location is convenient to the Studio City-Universal Studios area, and the Westside is just a short hop back down the San Diego Freeway. There are plenty of eateries a 2-block walk away at the Galleria. Compared to similar properties in the general area, it's convenient and a good value. I stayed here for 8 nights for a business trip, and this was perfect for an extended stay. It was located 2 miles from my place of business so it was great to be so close. On my last trip to Sherman Oaks, this hotel had not yet opened, so I was obliged to stay in Universal City - the long commutes on I-405 made me feel as though I was back in NYC, ugh. This hotel is immaculate and service is excellent; very helpful and courteous staff who go that extra mile. The full-service restaurant was very good; the menu had the standard hotel fare but included some original dishes that were very tasty. My room had a small sitting area and a large desk area; free wi-fi was included. Nice large screen HDTV. This property is convenient to I-405 and 101 freeways; two blocks away is the Sherman Oaks Galleria with shops, food courts, movie theatres and the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory :) I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here on my next trip out west. I thought the hotel was nice property - clean with a helpful front desk. Sure there was some traffic noise, but it hardly bothered me with the windows shut. It was perfect for my particular needs as I was visiting family for the Holidays and wanted some privacy. The hotel was in a perfect location for that. I also found it convenient for touring (assuming you have a car). We went to Universal, Hollywood Blvd. area, Santa Monica, Venice Beach. Since it is right off the highway, it was no problem getting anywhere (assuming you avoid rush hour(s)). This relatively small Marriott property, is very well maintained, and the staff is very professional. They were very friendly, yet professional and proper. The staff exudes respect for guests, and are very accommodating. By the way, there is absolute quiet, as you sleep in this business city. First, being a Starwoods member, I was skeptical of staying at a Courtyard, but I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The hotel is conveniently located near the 405 & 101 in the valley & is about 15 minutes away from Sunset Blvd. Ventura Blvd is just down the block & there are many restaurants in the area. In reading the reviews, I was concerned about quietness. We stayed on the 10th floor & since the sliding doors/windows were double-paned, we had no issues with noise. The sound from the air conditioning unit was noticeable, but was not more noisy then most hotels I've stayed at. The beds were very comfortable, the room was clean, & the bathroom was a decent size. The front desk lady, Gema, was very professional & check-in was very easy. The hotel had also noted my request for a quieter room and also accommodated my request for a late check-out. The hotel does charge $15 for parking, but it is in a secured lot, with in and out privileges. I would not hesitate to stay here again for the convenience & service. Nice Hotel right next to the 405 and 101, walking distance to the Sherman Oaks Galleria. The hotel was recently renovated. The windows are double paned for noise reduction, Very nice Front Desk, I would recommend this hotel to anyone we had to stay overnight in the sherman oaks area of Los Angeles and found this marriott. i cannot say enough nice things about it. from front desk staff to the manager and parking attendant, everyone was so friendly, warm and welcoming. very nice room and comfortable bed and free perks including free delicious coffee int he lobby and cookies at checkin. thecmanager easily straightened out a booking error and couldn't have been more professional. highly recommended. also, very conveniently located to freeway, getty, skirball, etc. I had read several reviews and was concerned about the noise. I'm a light sleeper so this is always one of my main criteria. I stayed on the 6th floor, away from the freeway but Ventura is a very loud street. This affected my sleeping. The hotel itself has been newly decocorated in a very attractive modern style and the bed was quite good. The fitness center was not in great repair. One machine was missing the TV screen and the audio output wasn't working in the other. I changed to a different hotel for my next visit due to these problems. Booked the hotel during NBA All Star weekend and it turned out to be great. A little difficult to get out of the parking garage, but very close to our friend's place in Studio City and in a nice neighborhood, so that made it better. Easy to get to since it is right off the freeway, but the noise didn't carry to the room. Walking distance to several decent places to eat (part of the mall). Room was clean and comfortable and got TNT, so a great experience overall. Free Wifi! In town visiting friends was very convienant and located right off the 405. I did not notice any noise in the room I had from the Freeway. Parking was ample and the parking rate was resonable. Rooms were comfortable and the hotel seemed generally well maintained. Staff was friendly. Serveral good restaurants within easy walking distance. I stay at this hotel on a regular basis during our work trips to Van Nuys. Reasons this hotel is great: - The rooms are lovely. Very clean and the bed are super comfortable. - The internet is very fast and FREE for hotel guests. - The hotel is walking distance to the Sherman Oaks Galleria, so there are plenty of restaurants, etc. close by. - The staff is very friendly and helpful. Only cons: - The food in the hotel restaurant is very pricey -- but, that isto be expected. The coffee is free for guests in the morning, but not if you dine in and your server brings it to you. - Some of my colleages have said they can hear traffic from the freeway, but I have never had a problem. Nothing but good things to say about this hotel on Ventura Boulevard....It has a dated exterior but that's where the nitpicking ends. The room was clean with modern conveniences....The bed was very comfortable and we had plenty of room for our 11-month-old's portable playpen. The staff was friendly and quite responsive.. We normally run away from hotel restaurants (for a number of reasons) but this one pulled us in......The FOOD IS FANTASTIC...Breakfast,lunch or dinner. You know you're doing well when locals drop by to eat. You can't beat the location...open the door and the popular Ventura Boulevard awaits Very helpful staff. Room was modern, spacious and clean. I used the business centre. It was complementary (unlike some other hotels I have been to) and very comfortable chair that allowed me to work comfortably for a few hours. No complaints on the room / bathroom. It was walking distance to a nearby outdoor shopping galleria and nice restaurants. Note - The outdoor galleria was not one you can spend half-a-day at. I was told that Westfield Sherman Oaks was only 10 minutes away but have never been there as I got carried away at Santa Monica. There was no valet parking though. We rented a car and only checked in at the hotel late in the evening. Thought we could drop our luggage at the entrance and proceed to check-in and get someone else to park our car but valet service was not available. I ended up checking in whilst my partner parked the car at the hotel carpark. Don't think this was a big deal though. Our first time at a Courtyard was a wonderful surprise. This particular branch was apparently used as a prototype to redesign Courtyards to have a more urban chic style. The result is great. The lobby and lounge are stunning with understated, modern design. The rooms are simpler, but comfortable, clean, modern, and spacious. The hotel is safe, with an inside, free parking area, and you have to use your room key to use the elevator. Breakfast is much cheaper than at Marriott, and at least as good. The staff is phenomenal. Mike, the front desk manager, and the rest of the front desk staff, were not just friendly and helpful with retrieving our lost luggage, they were genuinely enthusiastic and passionate about their unique Courtyard. From the bartender to the breakfast waitresses, all staff were great. We thank all of them for a great stay. They really made a difference. If we are ever back in the area, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll stay here again. Nice hotel.. but food is costly. staff is courteous.. but rooms were not that great...",,,
BruceMichael98,1174552,"Stayed for one night in September 2010. Good clean room, good location with loads of nearby good eateries. Cheapish although surcharges for 'event weekends' like formula 1 and $10 per hour for late checkouts with the only exception being if you check in after 3 am. Rooms basic, bathrooms small but OK. Air conditioning, limited cable TV service. Internet at a price Stayed for 1 night in Septembver 2010. Large spacious clean room, very quiet despite end of Ramadan festivities around. Fantastic food selections around hotel. Swimming pool on site otherwise no frills. Very reasonable. Unlike many Hotel 81s this one isnt directly in red light district. About 5-10 minutes walk from 2 MRTs - $20 taxi ride from Airport - $12 to Airport We booked a family room for 1 night in October 2010. Great location at one end of main shopping strip of Orchard Road. Room potentially OK with two double beds (not queen) but beds were appalling with sags and slopes and almost impossible to get comfortable. No late checkout was allowed and internet cost $5 per hour. Soap from dispenser in bath and sink. Room was clean and service was OK. Was cheap booked through Agoda.","Rooms were basic but large, beds were comfortable, bathroom dated, close to MRT, wifi worked fine and as we had two devices they gave us two vouchers each day:-) Pool is very clean and large, aircon worked...we had no issues at all......for the price a good cheap choice for Singapore We stayed several days at this Tristar 81 chain. It was adequate and clean, airconditioning was fine and not noisy and although dated, the room could be darkened at night and it was not a noisy location so we slept well. Great to have free internet access. We were grateful for the quiet room upstairs away from traffic noise yet its good location- walking distance to metro with fantastic places to eat in adjoining streets and a supermarket closeby. Also it was competitive price-wise, but we checked out other Hotel81 options in the surrounding area and found they were cheaper-- so maybe for our next Singapore stay, we might check out those options... Even if situated on a ""pub and love streets"" location, the hotel is very quite and it's not used as sex hotel. Room are really very big and quite clean. Near the metro stop and the shopping area. Swimming pool is very nice. Free wifi. Nothing special but clean and very good price compeared to Singapore standard. Rooms are basic, dated and uncared for. Beds changed daily and towels, but nothing else unless you ask reception. For example, loo rolls, tea and coffee. Internet is free but you have to ask for a voucher each day and you can only connect one device at a time. Aircon works, but only just. Room is cooler than outside humidity, but not by much. Despite being a no smoking hotel, the entire second floor stinks of stale cigarette smoke. I would only stay here again if I could not find anywhere else. We'd booked one night in a family room at Hotel 81 Tristar on our way back from Thailand. We'd previously stayed at Hotel 81 Dickson so were expecting it to be about the same. Tristar was much better with very large rooms, great location (numerous food courts and shops nearby & not too far from the airport) and the swimming pool was quite nice too. We'd probably stay here again on our next visit to SIngapore. Stayed three nights in November, 2011. First the good. Close to the MRT, eating places (mostly Muslim) and area seemed fairly safe for families. The not so good. All the windows were riveted closed. Actually had a strip of steel across the centers on all windows including the bathroom and they were riveted not screwed together. The only way out of a window would be to break the glass. We were on the highest floor (4th) and could not understand why. When I ask the desk clerk he seemed to act as if not to understand my question. Hotel was not clean. When the cleaner came to do the room he did replace the sheets, but did not clean the wood floor. If you have any lung problems this place would make it worse. Old tv, broken furniture and a/c that was filthy and did not cool. Most everything in the room needed some kind of repair or cleaning. Would not stay there again. The price was $507 Sin Dollar or $393 US for 3 nights. Not a bargain at all. Stay closer in town and cut down on the ripoffs by the taxi drivers too. We stayed here in September 2009, as a layover stop on way from NZ to UK. Two nights on way out, one night on way back. Good cheap accommodations. Bit noisy on the first stay as there were loud street markets in the area. Return visit three weeks later much quieter as markets were gone. Overall decent as a place to come and go straight from the airport. I had a few days in Singapore whilst on business and chose this hotel because it's location was a stones throw from where I needed to be based and because I'm familiar with the Hotel 81 brand. The price was almost double similar hotels in Geylang but I decided to give it a go. I arrived very late due to a delayed flight but everything was in order with my reservation. The taxi cost SGD17 from the airport, I would normally use the MRT but it was already closed. There is a food court basically under the hotel which has almost every kind of food you could want and is very cheap. The room was large and clean. There is even a swimming pool, but I didn't have time to use it. it is about a 10 minute walk from Paya Lebar MRT, there are buses to almost every where which stop just outside the hotel. On the last night, there was a large group which brought associated noises with them and a domestic dispute spilled on to the corridor at 2am, but a quick call to reception and it was dealt with. All in all, even with the increased room rate, I would stay here again. I have to say the staff were very nice and helpful, but the rooms, very basic not that clean. our room was a disgrace, the power point was 1/2 hanging off the wall, pointed it out to them but never fixed, no plug for the bath, mould on the bathroom wall, 3 people (and adult and 2 kids) in one room no extra towels the sheets not changed, broken wall light, fuzzy tv, cable internet did not work even though the cable was int he room and the wifi was so weak the older kids sat near the lifts (which were in another building) just to get a singal and the list can go on. Also be ware if staying here the bathroom floor is slightly lower than your main room floor so I nearly fell, it was the same in the disabled room as well which also they had no plastic chairs in the disabled room for the shower (ended up grabbing one from the pool) Pros: if backpacking around it might be okay, the pool was nice, great food right next door and again I must say the staff were very nice if you have a family, or look for a clean cheap place, do not book a room at this hotel. The staff has never helped us, from the minute we came in, the room was not clean at all, the sink was licking, water droped during 2 days without being repaired. Do not expect too many english channels, as the choice will be very very limited. Do not go into this hotel!! Stayed for 1 night in Septembver 2010. Large spacious clean room, very quiet despite end of Ramadan festivities around. Fantastic food selections around hotel. Swimming pool on site otherwise no frills. Very reasonable. Unlike many Hotel 81s this one isnt directly in red light district. About 5-10 minutes walk from 2 MRTs - $20 taxi ride from Airport - $12 to Airport We stayed here last year for a few nights and found the room to be basic but immaculate. The staff were exceptionally helpful and cheery.Also very reasonably priced and transport options readily available. I wouldn`t hesitate to book again . We stayed at the Tristar for a week, we were initially attracted by the price and proximity to lots of cheap eating places. We were definitely pleasantly surprised - the rooms were clean (clean bedding daily), the staff very friendly, the hotel had a very pleasant swimming pool. We were within walking distance of the MRT but also could pick up taxies very easily. There were plenty of very cheap places to eat close by (some of them 24 hours) but when you were in your room you were not aware that you were close to the hustle and bustle of the area. Room was a good size, air con worked. I would stay again. A great spacious good value room, after asking was advised there are no glasses or any extras only hotel 81 coffee mugs and kettle, no ice, really large pool, cable tv that works, fridge, close to excellent food hall and supermarket , ( never saw a prostitute and I was hoping to see this culture ) and easy interesting daytime walk to MRT and buses - I think it would have been lovely about 30 years ago now just a shell of its former glory, and thought a great start to our month away in Cambodia. However It however was the worst possible feeling after check out and signing off for the safe deposit box - it was not noticed till later that $US150 had been removed from money pouch ( absolutely certain of this amount missing) - why was this possible - because stupidly took up the offer for the management to hold both keys - reducing risk of a $500 key replacement fee- no point in contacting them from another country, too late. What a great find! For under $Sing 100 Tristar offers clean, large, and comfortable A/C rooms with a fridge, beautiful swiming pool, internet computers and a great staff who are eager to please. The hotel (close to Malay Village) is a 10 minute walk to the Paya Labar MRT, a five minute walk to the SMRT public bus stop and is located in an interesting neighborhood with many inexpensive tasty ethnic eateries. We will return to this gem!",,,
martiangirl198,577480,"The hotel's location is really easy to find, on a quiet street in the Back Bay area, just a very short walk to all of the shops, bars and restaturants. The hotel itself was wonderful. The rooms were very plush, even with your own robe! Very very nice. The value for money of the Back Bay Hotel was outstanding. I would definately recommend the hotel and stay there again. My friends and I were looking for a cheap place to stay in central Rome and we weren't disappointed. We booked a private three bedroomed room with ensuite and were extremely pleased;. the room even had a TV and a fridge. It is situated only four blocks from the Termini Station where you can get anywhere in Rome for 1 Euro, and it's only about a mile away from the Colloseum and Trevi Fountain if you want to walk. The only downside was the breakfast. I would not recommend paying for this as 3 Euros gets you just a croissant and roll with jam, and a selection of drinks. Coffee and tea were not great. You can easily walk down the road and get a beautiful panini for the same price. Overally though I would definately recommend the Termini. Although it seemed like if you booked a private room, you were seperate from the hostel part, so I cannot comment if it is vastly different if you stay in a dorm.","After reading many reviews concerning accommodation in Rome I can now say all rooms within all the hotels appear to be very clean but on the small side. This in itself is not a real issue as long as you use your accommodation purely as a place to rest after a busy day of site seeing. I personally did not find the noise from traffic an issue (we were staying on one of the main roads via Nationale), the only problem was the amount of apparently ill people in Rome with ambulances constantly charging around Rome with sirens continually blurring. I feel sorry for the drivers who must have to leave after a short period of driving due to hearing difficulties. For larger groups i.e. 4 or more hotel termini offers apartments located on via Nationale some distance from the actual hotel but the services of the hotel were never required during our stay. The location of the hotel and apartments are very good as all links are close by the Termini which is the main railway station in Rome (good for trips further a field), the metro and all buses seem to go down via Nationale at some point. Tiny room that smelt of sewerage, bed slats were all broken, shower flooded the entire room, bars had been cut out of window (big enought for someone to climb through)which wouldn't lock and was told my baggage 'might' still be in storage when I returned from day trip. If it hadn't been late at night and storming I would have walked out! Definitely not worth the money and did not feel safe staying there by myself! At least staff were decent enough to upgrade me the next night however I was charged extra! My friends and I were looking for a cheap place to stay in central Rome and we weren't disappointed.

KellyMath22,514434,"The hotel was good, nothing amazing but not bad. Staff was nice and helpful. The restaurant was good but expensive. Breakfast was provided free each morning and there was a good variety. To actually get into the center of Rome is a bit of a trek. The nearest train station is Tiburtina. When looking at a map it seemed like it wasn't too far of a walk but as two young women we really didn't feel safe the moment we stepped out of our hotel onto the street. We opted for taking the bus to Tiburtina as the bus station was right across (a pretty busy and hard to cross) street. The bus was packed full but it was an okay way to get there. If you want to feel a bit safer and closer to the action I don't recommend staying here. If you're okay with have to take a little transportation and want the cheaper price its okay. We didn't have high expectations coming into this place but it was just right. Te rooms were very similar to dorm rooms. We had two twin sized beds and our own bathroom so that was perfect. There was air condition so that was great for the hot weather while we were there. The only issue was that if too many people had their air conditioners on it would blow the fuse or something and then the air conditioning (and the wi-fi!) would be off for ten minutes or so but it always came back on quickly. The location was right near the train station which was nice since I couldn't imagine dragging suitcases any farther. What was also great was that getting around venice is hard - maps are useless. But since we were close to the train station there were always signs directing us there so we had no trouble getting back.","The hotel was good, nothing amazing but not bad.

This was our first time to Italy and in one week we saw VENICE, ROME, PISA, and a few other places. Rome was by far the hardest to get around in. We had a rental car and given that I do not like public transportation, this was the best way to get around in Rome since it is way cheaper and Rome is known for it's insane traffic. We were stuck in the bus on the way back from the Colosseum for about 2 hours, in very tricky traffic had we driven. This HOTEL was perfect, the bus stop is right across the street to go out and two steps away on the way back. The hotel is in a non busy street. I love the layout and location. The staff was nice and ensured we had a map that we understood and also gave us directions to using the subways and how to come back and such. They speak almost every language which is awesome, we would try spanish and french aside from english, they knew it all. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very cosy. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here, Perfect location. I will say, there where no restaurants around if you wanted to walk but then again we ate dinner in the hotel and very much enjoyed it. Stayed 3 nights, sheets & towels were changed daily, a simple luxury we appreciated very much. Found no tea/coffee making facilities but this was soon rectified with one call to the reception. The hotel is a fair walk from the station but we didn't mind walking even after 10.00pm, there are 2 buses that would take you to the Metro station, all attractions are a short train ride away. We found the staff to be friendly & rooms clean. A variety of foods were offered at breakfast on each day. We dined at the hotel restaurant on our final night & enjoyed southern Italian cuisine with local wine. We will definitely stay at the Blu Hotel Roma on our next trip to Rome. Location: If you work in London and use to rush hour walking speed its will take you 18 minutes from the main Metro (Tiburtina) If you from America more likely you have big bags or maybe fews...this could be 45 minutes...dragging...Bus no:409 and 545 fromTiburtina bus station stop about 300 meters from the hotel.Bus journey 5 minutes!.No way this hotel 700 meter from the main station (Tiburtina) If you bought a 3 days Metro travel pass you can use it on these bus. Room: Very clean because everything is new,No carpets in room but tiles! so very noisy (especially at night) This is not sound proof room so you can hear next door...pretty much everything! bad room noise insolation + 2 single bed on tiles = 3 nights no sleep. Breakfast:Coffee machine is great (free) but service with fuss!..eatable choice. I don't felt welcome in the reception...again maybe because service with fuss... Out to the right from the hotel about 4 minutes you find a pub and a kebab shop (highly recommend) and another 5 minutes you will find a little shopping mall with hypermarket. I spend 0.45 euro for 1L mineral water and its 2.50 euro for 500ML at the hotel minibar. Free Internet only for business guest :-) but their have a PC at the lobby FOC and you can print your boarding pass there too. The area is not pose at all so its good in summer but I won't dare to walk it at night especially in winter where day light shorter. For what we experienced put another 10 - 15 euro on your budget a day will diffidently make it worth it to stay in Rome city center. I feel we spend at least 2 hrs in a day traveling to Rome and with the surroundings I don't risk go on metro to Tiburtina after 10pm....so for many reason I won't recommend it... The Hotel is 3 bus stops away from the Tiburtina Station. From Tiburtina Station you get the train which goes directly to the airport so there is no need to go to Termini Station for the airport train. You get the bus 409 outside of the Tiburtina station and in no time you're at the hotel. A few vagrants hanging around the train station at times. The staff was helpful and friendly. There are free maps at the reception and metro/bus tickets are also sold at the reception. The room was typical best western standard featuring comfy beds, adequate closet space, mini bar, safe, cnn and bbc world on cable, free wifi, lovely bright modern bathroom, shower caps, bath gel, shampoo, soap, fresh towels. There was a computer in the lobby and printer. We never ate at the restaurant, so cant say what the food is like. Only a few persons seemed to dine there. We found an excellent little pizzeria near to the roundabout, that sold delicious pizza to order and other tasty pasta dishes and salads for very reasonable prices. There was always a take-away line outside and locals loved it. There is an Auchan supermarket abt 7mins walk from the hotel. We stocked up on water there. Breakfast at the hotel was very good for us and worth the price. It was buffet with: bacon, ham, scrambled and bolied eggs, salami, cheeses, regular and wholewheat croissants, sausages, whole wheat bread, white bread, toasting facilites, selection of juices and hot beverages, milk; yougurt, water, selection of fresh fruit, freshly baked lemon cake and marble cake, biscuits, crackers, jams, prunes, tarts, fresh vegetables.... if you're a breakfast person then it's definitely worth the money. The hotel has complimentary services which you can request e.g. a clothes iron, ice, kettle. The walls in the room are a bit thin but nothing to complain bitterly about. We had a pleasant stay. We stayed here for 3 nights. Positive: It is clean and cheap. It is a good choice if you are not going to spend any time in the hotel.. Negative: Thin walls (can hear from the room next door - TV and people speaking), Staff are okay.. not very helpful, room service is bad... we had to call thrice for some milk for our coffee.. which ultimately did not get delivered. They said they did not have anyone to send it up to the room. Location is not too bad, a train and bus ride away from city centre. Tis is not a four star hotel.. 3 star at best My wife and I travel to Rome on a regular basis and we have selected the Blu Hotel as our hotel of choice becuase of the great service, facilities and staff. We recently visited to celebrate my father in law's 80th birthday. We needed to host a suprise party for all of our family who reside in Rome and were concerned about how, where and the quality of the food as they are Roman residents. We choose to have the party at the hotel. The staff was great! They decorated the dining room, the food was exceptional and the service was first rate. The hotel staff has always been very helpful and professional. Most are able to speak fluent English and treat us like family. The hotel is relatively new and very modern for Rome. The rooms are larger than most you would find in Italy and they include a patio. The hotel is off the beaten path of the tourist locations, but it is very nice to stay in a neighborhood and get a feel for the Roman people outside the tourist locations. The bus stop is close by, taking you to the train station and a short ride for any sight seeing. You can get to the Vatican, Trevi or where every you want in 15 minutes. The staff will help you find your way around, so if you want a better perspective on Rome away from the typical hustle bustle this is definately the place to stay. I have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel or the staff. Highly recommended!!!",,,
looptail,199401,"The hotel is easy to get to by bus or S-Bahn; the reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. We had a room on the fourth floor overlooking Grolmanstrasse - the street isn't that busy anyway and there was very little noise. Clean, comfy and otherwise welcoming.

Room: clean but tired - mould on the bathroom ceiling - otherwise reasonably comfy. Our room was at the back of the hotel so there was little noise; however, other guests did lean out of their windows to smoke, and the smell drfited back in to our room and the corridors. Air conditioning was fitted but won't be operational until June (we were told), so the rooms got quite warm at night. Breakfast: very basic. No decent tea or coffee (all from vending machines), the only hot dish at the buffet was scrambled egg.

I had my 7 month old with us and they brought up a playpen in minutes. very friendly staff and comfortable room. Wifi wasn't free, but was very reasonably priced. Excellent breakfast to start the day. The hotel is nearby several attractions; and located in between two s-bahn stations should you not want to walk. Stayed here Friday 17th - Sunday 19th February. We walked from the S-bahn station at the zoo, no more than 10 mins and that was because we were already window shopping. The main shopping street - the Ku'damm, is no more than a few steps from the hotel and its beside an underground station too. There's plenty of shopping in this area, as well as dining. Tour buses all stop around this area too, so you are never far away from getting to all the sites. The room was spotless, very modern and good amount of space. Bathroom was a bit small, but again, modern and clean. Nice touch in the room was underfloor heating for the tiled floor. The deal included use of the mini bar (couple of beers, some wine, fruit juice, soft drinks, water, chocolate, snacks - about 40 euros worth) and a late checkout on the sunday.Breakfast was also included and this was great - hot foods (eggs, sausages, bacon, etc), cold (meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurts), breads, juices, teas & coffee - and fresh waffles which were perfect with some chocolate spread! I checked out the fitness site but didn't use it - a small areawith 3 or 4 machines, but there was also a sauna, steamroom and hot beds which friends used and they loved it. Word of warning for anyone going to Berlin for the weekend - dont leave shopping until the Sunday, because 99% of stores are closed. Only the gift stores are open - so you may want to go to the museums on the Sunday. We stayed in this hotel in December 2011/January 2012 to celebrate New Year. The hotel is a stylish, modern place which is very comfortable and clean. The location could not be better with several excellent restaurants and bars at its doorstep. We really appreciated the spa and gym on the 7th floor which was a great place to relax after walking Berlin all day. The public transport is just round the corner â U-Bahn at Uhlandstrasse and S-Bahn at Savigny Platz. If you like shopping, it is just two minutes away from a great BerlinÂ´s shopping Street at Kurfuerstendamm. The only downside is that they charge for the wi-fi which is not so good if you like to be using the Internet on your travels. The hotel is easy to get to by bus or S-Bahn; the reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English.

No restaurant, which was a little annoying; Internet terminals were not particularly cheap either. We'd stay there again though - the location, comfort and helpful staff were great. Great rooms, very clean. Super comfortable bed!!! Great breakfast. We had a Weekend Extender deal, which was great (breakfast included, LATE CHECK-OUT up until 17:00h on Sunday and one FREE MINIBAR). Recommended! Very good location, close to a lovely square - Savignyplatz - full of lovely restaurants!Close to public transportation - U and S (although the U1 lain is now under construction so there are some changes that made it not so convenient... ) Yana A quiet (ish) location for this very well situated hotel. Rooms are fresh, clean and in our case, very spacious. Hospitable staff, who respond with charm to every request, manage to make it seem far more intimate than any other large Berlin hotel I've visited. This is the third NH hotel I have booked and this standard of service and quality has been consistent throughout - yet each property has been unique, it is not a bland chain hotel experience. I return to Berlin in June and will stay a little longer this time, possibly sample a few more of the excellent restaurants in the area. The hotel is ideally placed for shopping and sight seeing. Its close to the Metro. When we were there the charge for breakfast and the internet was very expensive. If you can get a deal for breakfast then I would strongly recommend that you should. I think it was 18 euros each so we didnt bother. We went out locally there are plenty of places about. At the time all hotels were busy in Berlin for the New Year holiday so this was more, all there was at a sensible price. Its not cheap but the location helps. good 4star hotel a few steps from one of berlin's main avenue. one may not expect such fine hotel from the outside, but once you step in it all looks new and bright, although basic. our room was huge with a comfy kingsize bed and an extra rollaway for the teenager. minibar, safe and coffeemaker available. rather small flat screen tv with some 35 channels. as we stayed in the main building train noise was there, but bearable. fine fitness- and sauna area on the 7th floor connecting to a large outdoor roof terrace. turn right on kurfuerstendamm for maredo steakhouse and netto supermarket, both just a few minutes walk from the hotel. would always stay here again. The hotel, recommneded by our travel agent, was an excellent choice. The personnel at the reception, bar, breakfast room, as well as housekeeping were all friendly and helpful. The hotel is has a pleasant modern decor with a nice Bar near reception. The room was quiet, large and Comfortable with a great Bed and well appointed bathroom. The breakfast buffet was generous and varied - friendly personnel and great coffee as well. The location was great - close to both S- and U-bahn and the bus. To recommend. The hotel is very well located. Just next to the Kurfuerstendamm with many public transport connection. The Airport shuttle is also just stopping in front of it. I liked that it was possible to have the breakfast in bed (paid only a little bit extra for it). We also had a special with a late check-out possibility which was very convenient. Stayed here for 4 nights last week and found the experience to be very enjoyable. Friendly staff, clean rooms, but some of them faces the railway. Indeed centrally situated. I thought the location was perfect. Walking distance to a city bus stop. Easy to use the city buses to and from Airport. The hotel was very affordable, clean and centrally located. The hop-on, hop-off bus is just around the corner on Kurfurstendamm. The Hard Rock Cafe is within walking distance as the church (forget the name) that was damaged during the war. The are plenty of restaurants on Kurfurstendamm and shopping. Beside the church there is an underground shopping center and an Irish pub (forget the name). It didn't serve food in the evening but there was a live band playing. Alright spot for a Sunday night.",,,
tabbykins,233866,"This hotel was built 1910 as a town house. It has been a hotel for many decades & the decor, furnishings are intact. The whole place is straight our of an Isherwood novel & provides a very atmospheric & cosy experience in Berlin. It is a gem in a great location with good transport links to the rest of the city. Plenty of good restaurants, bars nearby, including one on the next block with a 3 hour Happy Hour. Plus a Netto for wine in the room. We had one of the larger rooms at 145 Euro per nght inc a good breakfast. There are smaller rooms at a lower price I believe. Our room was HUGE with a seperate glassed in sitting area with lovely views of the Ku'dam. The reception lady showed me some of the other larger rooms to help us choose for our next stay. It is tremendous value for a hotel of this style & loction. The staff are very helpful & kind. The hotel only has a small number of rooms so you feel like a house guest. There is a small bar in the corner of the breakfast room but we didn't use it. Two things I would suggest to improve the experience even more - 1) Tea/coffee making facilities in the room 2) Soft music playing at breakfast, Baroque by a German composer would be nice. I loved this hotel & will return. Many famous people have stayed here, including David Bowie & Arthur Miler. I would hate to see it over-restrored or modernised in any way. If you want that, you can find it elsewhere easily enough but once a place like this is changed it will be lost forever. We've stayed once within the hotel itself & this our 3rd stay in the Vittoria Apartment, one block down the Corso from the hotel. Both are great but we much prefer the apartment which is spacious with bedroom, bathroom, very good size lounge/dining room, small kitchen (only used by us so store Prosecco & beer in fridge & making teas.) Since our visit last year the a brand new very chic bathroom has been installed. Whilst we were there Rome was in the midst of a heatwave & the Aircon in the apartment was more than adequate & kept the whole apartment nicely cooled at all times. Breakfast in the hotel (included) was as good as always & as I had my arm in a sling the ladies were so kind insisting on helping me with things from the buffet. Location is as perfect as you will find in Rome & as many have said, the roof terrace garden, on 2 levels, with its lounging chairs & upper bar with tables, chairs & umbrellas is a divine spot at any time of day or night. Prices at the bar are surprisingly reasonable, less than surrounding bars. Staff are professional & helpful, many have been there for a long time, always nice to see familiar faces every visit. The price of the apartment is in my view excellent value. I would never stay anywhere else in Rome & staying in the apartment makes me feel like I live there. Thank you management & staff of Mozart for looking after us so week every time we visit you. We'll be bcak, of course! This was our 2nd stay in the Vittoria Apartment, we have also stayed in the hotel itself. We prefer the apartment for the space & privacy it affords. As others have said the location is great easy walk to most places you would want to visit, including St Peter's/Vatican & also Trastevere. For further afield the Spagna metro is close at hand. We have visited Rome many times but now always stay at this apartment. It is very spacious, nicely appointment with plenty of starge space. A previous reviewer said there was no heating, this is not the cae, there is heaters in both the lounge and the bedroom, operated by remote control. They're a bit tricky though but give out sufficent heat once you've mastered how to work them (the bellman who showed us to the apartment took the trouble to explain but I didn't pay proper attention). The breakfast is very good for this price of hotel & I always find it sets us up for the day. I like the home-made quiche & pastries they have. Not the healthiest option but we do walk it off all day! The apartment does not come equipt with a kettle or wine glasses. Both essential in my view. One of the breakfast ladies (they are ultra helpful & nice) quickly provided me with the wine glasses but it took longer to get a kettle although the front desk did set us up with one the next day. I have to say, I have seen a deterioration in the front desk staff over the years since the first visit. It's not bad but just that they were really good then but now it is a bit more of an effort. Also, I have to agree they do not acknowledge returning guests (or their special occasions, like special anniversaries, birthdays etc). Most hotels do & it is appreciated, it makes you feel appreciated. However, we did get a 10% discount as repeat guests & the rate is very reasonable anyway.","First time in Berlin since 1995 - was looking for a quiet place that was close to public transportation and had some charm. Got it! Arrived early in the morning to this first floor establishment located on the Kur'Damm, offered coffee, and was promptly escorted to my room, which was actually a suite of a foyer/dressing room, full bathroom and double bed (American-sized full bed). The atmosphere reminds me of a c. 1920's house with several guest rooms. The breakfast room was really more of a parlor, with comfortable wingback chairs and rich tapestries. My room (#18) had a large bathtub, modern bathroom, and overlooked a courtyard full of bicycles and trees with birds. No cars. The bed was comfortable - but it does feel like you are sleeping in someone's home - furniture is older, but clean and linens are crisp but not ""industrial"". There is a low-key vibe to the place - breakfast is served at YOUR leisure, and rooms are kept tidy. The hosts were all very gracious and made me (a single lady traveller) feel most welcome. The only drawback (and I am very hesitant to say this) was the loud guest in the room next to me, who spoke on his cell phone all day at the desk of his room, which was located next to his door. Good thing he was using a dialect of German I can't understand, or I might know his state secrets! Rating comes from the AAA standard, btw. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and loved it. The rooms was clean and warm and spacious. The bathroom was large too with a great bath. Lots of hot water for a soak. All the rooms are individual and this added to the charm. Breakfast was a real highlight- Cereal, fruit, choice of breads, tea, coffee and an egg. We never rushed this part of our day, but rather savoured it. The staff were so helpful , most especially Mark who sorted out restaurants, glasses for a pre dinner drink and taxis. The location is on a good bus route (M29) and handy for most parts of town. Stay here, so much more than a clinical Holiday Inn or the like. This hotel was built 1910 as a town house. It has been a hotel for many decades & the decor, furnishings are intact. The whole place is straight our of an Isherwood novel & provides a very atmospheric & cosy experience in Berlin. It is a gem in a great location with good transport links to the rest of the city.

If you want that, you can find it elsewhere easily enough but once a place like this is changed it will be lost forever. This hotel is a gem from the 1930's. The property is well located and the rooms large. Staff are very helpful. It needs some $$'s spent and definitly new mattresses. However my wife and I would certainly stay here again. Apparently the Germans like hard beds ! O yes breakfast is excellent and included in rate. i stayed in this hotel with my wife. The breakfast and the employer at reception desk was great. Also the location is good. This is the only tree things i liked about it. The bed was terrible, made of wood, if we move at the bad, the ""cracking"" and the noise it makes wake up allways my wife and vice versa. It wasn't confort either, and i'm a litte big and the bed wouldn't fit, and in the feet was a wood ""wall"" so it was very uncomfortable. Also the housekeeping almost won't exist. That was the most bad! They didn't clean the room well, In the room don't have soap and shampoo (i never saw this). In the last day they even won't change the toilet paper! I will not stay there again! Very nice hotel, near everything: u bahn s banh and bus. Excellent location for restaurants. Room was large, personnal very courteous and helpful, we stayed 6days and would definitely go back. The only criticism, wi fi near lobby and restaurant so if your room is far from lobby, no in room wifi. I booked this hotel thanks to Frommer's guidebook, not really knowing what to expect. Berlin was the last leg of our trip and we were already tired and ready to head home...but then we checked into the Askanischer Hof and were amazed by how spacious and luxurious it was. Buzzing to get into the hotel was not an inconvenience, and although our room faced a busy street, it wasn't too loud. Breakfast was delicious, and the hotel was very centrally located - only a couple blocks to the metro station. I highly recommend this place for a comfortable yet reasonable hotel in Berlin. A wonderful Arts and Crafts style hotel, that felt completely unspoilt. A refreshing change to the multi-national chains. Amazing bedrooms and dining room (where breakfast is served.) It's like stepping back in time -- I expected to meet Christopher Isherwood on the stairs. Good location, with some excellent restaurants in easy walking distance. Very good for transportation links too. Lastly, would recommend one of the city walking tours. Fascinating, and a great way to see the city. What a wonderful small old hotel, oozing with charm. Furnished in antiques. Spacious comfortable rooms. Owner and staff very helpful. The personnel are all very helpful and, although they speak very good English, they were willing to help me struggle with my German. My room was #24, on the interior courtyard, which I was thankful for as it was the cool side of the building and there was a heatwave! The room was spacious and very clean, although the double bed would have been very small if there were 2 people in it. It was perfect for one person and a great value. I loved the location, the proximity to Savigny Platz and its restaurants, the KuDamm and virtually all forms of public transportation made it ideal. It was easy to get to all major sights and museums (using public transporation) yet felt more ""local"" than staying in the former East. Highly recommended. This hotel is brilliant. We stayed in room 12 which was huge. Rather than me try and describe, just check out the pages on their web site.Thats what we did and at first look went ""wow lets stay there"". The room 12 photo says it all. We really did sit in our room a few times and thought about just hanging around and soaking up the details of the hotel! Try a selection of cheeses, cold meats and breads served with a nice bottle of red wine served in your room for an evening snack after a day of sight seeing!! All the staff were good and the hotel has too many individual touches to try and mention The area surrounding the hotel was good with a S-Bahn station not far and buses out the front. My wife loved the the little knitted ""hats"" that came on top of the boiled eggs at breakfast.... Brilliant!! Recommend highly except for hot days. This is a fabulous hotel and I could not have been happier...then the temperature in Berlin increased to 90 - 100 degrees with little breeze. The hotel does not have air conditioning and due to the sunny view, our room was sealed by metal blinds to keep the temperature down. We lost our great view of the K'Damm and felt somewhat like prisoners! We asked for a fan and were provided one. We were simply miserable unless sitting closely and directly in the small fan area. I thought our misery was due to our lack of experience in ""hot"" places but was told by another guest, from Texas, that they had never sweated so much! The owner commented that it is not necessary to have air conditioning for the 2 weeks of hot weather in Berlin. I agree that this is a waste, however, I would definitely recommend another hotel for that 2 week period!! The Askanischer Hof is a very charming hotel, very clean and the staff are very helpful. It is located in a good central area, close to the bus terminal and train stations. It does not have air-conditioning and I imagine it could get quite warm during the summer months. I also found the breakfast to be slightly limited.",,,
Kim M,529534,"Great hotel! Great location with lots of restaurants close by. The pool is awesome with a separate area for kids. Even though our room was supposed to have a king bed..I am not sure if this is a king size...feels like a queen. The duck parade everyday is a special treat for kids and the family. Pointe Orlando is a 5 minute walk from the property and you also have lots of restaurants very close by. Will stay again....but this time have to check the size of the bed! :-) We loved both our stays at Blue Horizon in September. The front desk staff even helped us get priority seating at Joe Fortes for dinner to honor my birthday. We loved the balcony views and our room was clean with all the conveniences needed. We had breakfast once at the hotel and it was yummy. We would love to stay here again. Parking is expensive but all partking downtown is expensive. Great hotel!

We couldn't have been happier with our choice. We loved the quiet neighbourhood while still be central to everything. The front desk staff and the valet staff were really friendly and helpful. We stayed in a park vista room which was gorgeous. We loved the decor and everything was super clean. We had the bed & breakfast package which included the room, valet parking, breakfast and a late checkout. I've never had more bang for my buck staying in the city. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to everybody! Good last minute choice, but not for long stay. 3 bed ensuite is tight. Free internet - need password. Good breakfast. Decent location if you need something close to TXL (but TXL is closing down next year.) 30 Euro for double bed ensuite (two single beds with private toilet and shower) - breakfast included. A little high, in my opinion, but still ok. Linens and towels included. They even left a bar of soap with the towels, which was nice - not usually given to you - by what is typically considered a hostel, not a hotel. However, it is located right on the street corner, so it can be noisy. No parking available. If you arrive after normal business hours, it can be quite difficult to get a hold of someone in order to check in. No 'real' staff to speak of. I would only suggest staying here if it is a last minute choice/option, and you are just looking for a place to crash for the night. Great hotel! Great location with lots of restaurants close by.

Will stay again....but this time have to check the size of the bed! :-) I moved to Holiday Inn Express after two bad evenings at the Ramada Inn. Wow what a difference when I walked into Holiday Inn Express. It was clean, friendly staff and such a nicer hotel. The hotel accommodated several of us that had left the Ramada. The rooms were 100% cleaner and nicer than the Ramada and when I walked into the room at Holiday Inn Express both my son and I said, ahhh. It was so nice to be in a clean environment and have an air conditioner that worked. We were there 7 evenings and I have no complaints. I wanted to stay an extra evening and they made that happen with no issues. Plus, I loved that they had cookies in the lobby for the guests every afternoon. Family friendly hotel This hotel is located in the centre of Amsterdam. It is close to everything. It consists of several buildings on the street Rusland, only the facades are preserved. The hotel is currently ongoing a refurbishment process. It is about time, since the decoration of the old rooms must be almost 20 years old. The street part of the restaurant, the elevators and the gym have already been refurbished. Also the business rooms located on the other side of the reception building have been refurbished. We stayed on the reception side, got a very nice executive room on the top floor. Housekeeping has a very high standard. The reception staff is very friendly and efficient. The breakfast is excellent, so is the staf. The gym is small but has new equipment. The sauna is too small and unisex. There is also a solarium. No pool or jacuzzi though. The hotel bar is quite cosy. All in all, a very nice hotel. It is not cheap, but worth the money. Great hotel! Great location with lots of restaurants close by.

Stayed here for a baseball tournament and the rooms were dirty, some had mold. My socks were brown after walking around in the room and the pillows were lumpy. I slept on my hands, so my face and mouth would not touch the pillow. The air conditioner was horrible and did not cool down the room. One room had barf on the floor, the other had mold in the room that made my friends daughter very sick. My room had a whole in the bottom of the door and I was just waiting for rodents to come into the room. Raccoons walking around at night. Manager Steve W (Wellington) I believe was his last name is rude rude rude. He said he did not care if we complained because it would not hurt his ratings. The rooms DO NOT look like the pictures. There are not flat screen TV's as shown in the pictures or at least not in the room I was in or the rooms of friends. I do not recommend this hotel.

What else you need? If you want to all day sleep at hotel and say that there are not good, then you need to look after Hilton or Ritz Hotel:) For these prices there everything is exellent!Thanks Sickinger Hof Hotel for nice apartments and service:) If i will needed to stay in Belin one more time, I stayed at this hotel! Possibly the worst hotel in Berlin?! Dirt Rude staff Leaking toilet seat Lots of traffic noise, 24/7 No breakfast when leaving early When we called them to cancel one night (speaking english) they hung up on us, so a german friend had to make the call instead and even then they were rude!",,,
Brendon D,503529,"This hotel is a great value! The service is good, especially if you are out roaming the city, there is always someone at the front desk 24/7. The staff is very knowledgeable of the area and will gladly help out and point you in the right direction. The location is perfect, it is a block from Termini Station! I recommend taking the metro into the Colosseum station, it is inexpensive and easier than walking. The rooms are very big, comfortable beds and large bathroom. I also recommend adding on breakfast for your stay because it is an inexpensive meal before going out sightseeing. The breakfast has coffee, juice, pastries, rolls, etc. Overall, I had an amazing stay here at this hotel and would stay here again! The rooms are average size, it is comfortable. I was barely in the hotel because I was sightseeing all day/night. The staff is very nice and there is always someone at the front desk to help you. There is an elevator which is helpful for luggage. The rooms and hallways are very clean. The hotel is located only a few minutes away from the center of La Ramblas. It is also near metros which allows you to be anywhere in the city easily and quickly. It is a quick metro ride away from the beaches of Barceloneta. I was very happy with my stay here and would definitely stay in Hotel Aneto again!","4 nights stay at Aneto. All staff very friendly, excellent English and helpful, especially on the last night when my handbag was stolen in nearby restaurant (Carmelita's). Googled my bank to help cancel card and let me use the reception telephone as mobile also stolen in bag. THANK YOU. Nice and clean hotel. We had a very small room but we had our own bathroom. Only... Monday morning (March 19) we checked out of our room. After the check-out we left our bags between the other traveller bags in the reception, but after we came back to pick it up, before going to the airport, my bag was gone. The man at the reception desk could not help us out with this. He told us the camera in the reception does not record the events and no one left the hotel with a bag. The hotel is situated on a nice location, close to the Ramblas but far enough to be quiet. The hotel is clean and the reception is open 24/7. Across the street is a very nice restaurant! The rooms are average size, it is comfortable. I was barely in the hotel because I was sightseeing all day/night. The staff is very nice and there is always someone at the front desk to help you.

It is also near metros which allows you to be anywhere in the city easily and quickly. It is a quick metro ride away from the beaches of Barceloneta. I was very happy with my stay here and would definitely stay in Hotel Aneto again! Very reticent staff not spoiling you with any excessive conversation. The front desk is a desk in a common stairwell in a regular apartment building. If you want to store your luggage somewhere you just put it in the stairwell next to that desk... The staircase is dark and worn. But once up in the rooms on the second floor it is extremely fresh and clean. Like others have mentioned you can hear everything that happens in the rooms next door. I could not see any common areas. Only the rooms and the corridor. So the hotel is not suitable if you are several people and want a common place to meet within the hotel walls. The rooms are small. But they are clean and functional - and the situation is excellent! If you are looking for budget hotel with excellent location you choice will be hotel Aneto! It's only 2min walk from La Rambla and well situated at the quarter of El Raval. Nice restaurants, tapas bars, bakery shops and contemporary museum just next to Aneto. Rooms are quite small and practically there are not any acoustic isolation but if you don't mind don't hesitate to book! the hotel aneto is situated in a rustic buiding on the second floor all the rooms have recently been renovated they are very clean and well serviced daily most are ensuite with tv there is some building work going on near by but it is very quiet the ramblas plaza catallunya main barcelona market are all two minutes walk away next door to the aneto are pleny of good cafes and eating houses all in all a very nice place to stay Fantastic location, excellant value for money and very clean. The Aneto is simple and offers a very simple pastries, tea or coffee for breakfast. It's ideal for a city break, minutes away from Las Ramblas, with restaurants, bars and shops on your doorstep. 24 hrs reception, friendly staff. Safe boxes are available to rent. Hot water always available and this year aircondition was an added bonus. Downside were the noisy selfish guests who do not seem to realise that there are other guests in the hotel that were perahaps asleep. But this is not the fault of the hotel. If you are on a tight budget, but want a simple, clean and place to stay with a great location then I can highly recommend the Aneto. Me and a friend stayed here for 2 nights as we explored Barcelona. Excellent location right next to Las Ramblas and the taxi driver found it from the airport no problem. The rooms are good enough and are cleaned daily. It was exactly what we required at the end of the day, Cheap and location wise spot on!! This hotel requires all of your basic needs. The room we stayed was very small but cosy we liked it a lot. We had an exterior private bathroom. They cleaned the room and the bathroom everyday. Although it was pretty close to La Rambla street, which is packed with people for most of the time, the hotel was very quiet and and relaxing The value was really great! Location is superb a few minutes from the Ramblas. Reception were efficient and the rooms were a fair standard and no issues with cleanliness. Value was exceptional and the locale although not the best had several good restaurants walking away from the Ramblas. My comment on the walls being thin related to the fact there was a group making a lot of noise in neighbouring rooms late at night. Free breakfast included a coffee machine and some sweet confectionary which did not suit. The coffee was a nice start to the day. For money we paid it was fantastic- very clean with very nice cleaning lady, 24 h entrance, great location( although was difficult to find -even 2 taxi drivers didnt know it by name, and in night time there is a security doors front at it, so you cant see the sign board!) The room also was nice with many drawers, and free coffee in morning was just the thing we needed! We stayed in Aneto Hotel for 7 nights. It was me, my husband and our 2 1/2 year old child. The hotel was very central, in a side street to the Ramblas. I found it ideal for us as just infont of the hotel there is a playing field, a mini market where I could find lactose free milk for my child. (I couldn't find it in pharmacies but they had it in that mini market) The hotel isn't fancy at all, but very convenient for who wants to see the city and use it to take a shower and sleep. I already knew about the noise problem so I was prepared with ear plugs but never had to use them as the room was on the back side of the hotel. Only one night we had some problems with the neighbouring room as a group of young french students came that night and made a lot of noise until they settled down until 2am!!! As for the rest it was all ok. They had a small fridge at the reception which we could use for our milk. Only found out about it on our last 2 nights! All in all i recommend this hotel for any body who is there to see the city and not to relax in hotel.",,,
greenbid,229080,"Booked 3 nights because of trip advisor rating. Was really disappointed with accommodation and attitude of staff. Our room was very poor quality. We paid for double and got a room like a monks cell. A camp bed was pushed up against the mini bar and its ""headboard"" was the minibar. The minibar could not then be opened(we probably wouldnt have used it anyway considering bar prices). Naturally we complained and were given a room change the following day. The staff problem was the manager. He treated guests and other staff members as inconsequential. He was so dismissive of all who should come into contact with him. Other staff members seemed very inhibited by his superior attitude. Stayed for 4 nights in September and was more than pleased with hotel. Loved its location, so close to all the amenities of the lido. Could come and go with no hassle to Venice, only 10minutes by vaporetta. Hotel was comfortable with a relaxing terrace and we were lucky to have a quiet, large and newly decorated room. Would return.","We spent 2 nights at the Quattro Fontane before joining our cruise. It is a lovely hotel with very unusual decor - very quirky and interesting! Our room was located in the Annex next to the original hotel. The room was warm and clean with antique furniture and a balcony. The bathroom looked a little dated but fitted in well with the general furnishings. Breakfast was good and we found all the staff very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is located on the Lido and across the water from the centre of Venice but we had booked the Water Taxi from the airport to make life easier, then had the 72 hour pass for the water buses which also includes the local bus. The Lido has a long sandy beach which I am sure would be lovely in the summer but was the wrong time of year for us to use. Overall a very nice stay at the Quattro Fontaine. Booked 3 nights because of trip advisor rating. Was really disappointed with accommodation and attitude of staff. Our room was very poor quality. We paid for double and got a room like a monks cell. A camp bed was pushed up against the mini bar and its ""headboard"" was the minibar. The minibar could not then be opened(we probably wouldnt have used it anyway considering bar prices). Naturally we complained and were given a room change the following day. The staff problem was the manager. He treated guests and other staff members as inconsequential. He was so dismissive of all who should come into contact with him. Other staff members seemed very inhibited by his superior attitude. We stayed two nights. The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was charming. Breakfast and cappucinos were delicious. Bikes are available to use. The hotel staff that we dealt with were mostly unpleasant, impatient and a few even rude. One of the older male staff complained when I attempted to read the contract they asked me to sign, saying ""nobody in 40 years has ever read through this"". I felt like I was greatly inconveniencing him for the entire 1 min. spent reading it. One night when my husband went to bed early, I decided to get some dessert in the outside patio area, which was beautiful. It was quite empty out there. I asked for a table so I could enjoy some dessert and a much older man exclaimed that I would have to sit at the inside bar and that I was not allowed to sit outside for a mere dessert. There were at least 20 empty tables and maybe 1 or 2 other guests outside and it was fairly late. He wanted me to go to the bar? I would have felt like I was waiting for someone to pick me up! I'm an attractive lady and I would have not felt comfortable sitting at the bar. Then, when we were checking out, the hotel completely overcharged us for just about everything. Look at your bills closely prior to paying! They overcharged our hotel room 60 EUR a night, charged 12 EUR for a cappucino and americano that should have been included in our breakfast and 53 EUR for 2 desserts + 3 bar drinks. Additional charges on top of this too. Be forewarned! We stayed here for 3 nights based on good reviews. Firstly, to get there from Marco Polo airport get the Alilaguna RED line (Linea Rossa) and get off a the Lido (Casino) it will cost you 25 Euro each for a return ticket purchased at the airport. It takes about 1 hr. When you get off you are literally 20 m from the hotel - perfect! When I rang the hotel from the UK they told me to get the BLUE line, which stops at the Lideo (SME) - which is a good 20/25 min walk with luggage - or get a taxi. The reception staff are not friendly nor informative. When I asked for the location of a nearest supermarket, the reply was vague and not specific - poor show. The room was small, dark and cramped. The hotel grounds where unkempt and furniture was past it's best. The atmosphere felt unwelcoming and we never saw anyone in the bar. It appears everyone just used this as a base. My advise is book early and get a hotel on Venice Island - after all that's what you've come to see! After two weeks touring the Rome, Pisa & Tuscany areas with another couple, coming to this hotel was like visiting an oasis of peace and calm in the desert maelstrom of tourist Italy. It's like other reviewers have said - charming, quirky, old-fashioned in a nice way, but well worth a visit. Every room is different, with an odd collection of furniture and artifacts. Sit in some of the public rooms and you'll think you're in a museum. Accept it with, and enjoy, all its eccentricities and you'll really love your stay. Staff were pleasantly old-fashioned, but also long-serving, helpful and courteous. We ate in the outdoor restaurant a couple of nights which was a bit expensive but saved the walk to find the all too Italian alternatives. The regular dinner menu includes duck, but don't ask for it because according to the maitre d', they never have it and have never had it - perhaps there's no demand or is that what they tell everyone. Never mind, it adds to the unusual quirkyness of the place. Shame there's no pool though. A real secret gem of a hotel - we'd be more than happy to stay here again. HotelÃÂ´s location is excellent, waterbuses leave very near the hotel. Hotel is pretty and also the restaurant itself is worth visiting, good food and nice garden. Breakfast was also excellent. The reception staff spoke English well, and we got good advice from them about Venice etc. We have just spend four nights in this hotel. This was a delightful old style hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful. I left a bag containing my medication and jewellery on a ferry and through their efforts I recovered the same completely intact. This is a hotel to be savoured. I was sorry for tours who just rushed through and didn't have time to have the experience of staying in the hotel. The location of this hotel allows you to have both a beach holiday - a clear warm sea and freshly raked sand every morning, free showers and great food at the beach - and a classic Venetian holiday - combined. The beach is featured in 'Death in Venice'. We ate at the hotel each evening, and the food and service was wonderful - remember to leave room for dessert! All meals are served in the garden if you wish and the weather is good, but beware the biting, but otherwise harmless, mosquitoes. The hotel is filled with eccentric artefacts which add to its charm. This old hotel is an anachronism living on past glory. It is internally spotlessly clean and filled with antiques and old artifacts . The two buildings that make up the hotel are incongruous together. The main building looks like a Swiss/ German Chalet hotel that you see in the Alps. The other more modern Finnish construction is peculiar with weird staircases and shaped windows that I found very ugly. There is no elevator. The bath in our annexe bedroom was extremely narrow and worn with a very rough enamel surface. The surrounding area had worn paint work that needed a make over. A flexible shower hose was connected but it was impossible to have a stand up shower as there wasn't a shower enclosure. Although clean the premises was tired looking and the gardens were very overgrown and untidy allowing insects to thrive and bite! The menu is frightfully expensive and very limited as is the charge to use the beach. 71 Euro per day for a cabin and chairs is absolute extortion ,especially on top of the substantial charge for staying in the Quattro Fontane . We ate once in the restaurant on arrival and were served by an extremely old waiter who literally chucked the cutlery and napkins in front of us. The service took forever. Please note that the Lido's greatest asset is the shell beaches. They are a complete disgrace and very dangerous, littered with great heaps of wooden flotsum and industrial detritus swept in from the sea. Huge whole trees had been washed up and were either teathered to poles in the water or left on the water margin. I have only ever seen such a mess on one other beach in Mexico. The shoreline on the Lido is highly dangerous especially for young children. Considering the status of this island it is unacceptable that it should be kept in this condition. It is also a very big insult to tourists who have an expectation of staying somewhere lovely We stayed in the family suite and thought this hotel was great. Rooms were large and clean. The hotel staff were very friendly, spoke very good english and were professional but relaxed. There are buses every 10 minutes on the main road which take you the vaporetto stop and from there you can hop on the boat to Venice. There are no kettles in the rooms so bring your own if you want to make a cup of tea. Perhaps the best feature is the large garden where you can eat breakfast or have a drink in the shade. Breakfast includes bacon and eggs so you can fuel up. Deserves it's four stars, not the cheapest but you have to pay for quality. Also it's much better to stay on Lido than Venice; it's more spacious, greener, quieter and only 15mins away on the vaporetto.",,,

Very well designed hotel; the staff was very helpful and eager to please. T Definitely a place to stay again. Lovely hotel in a fantastic location 20 yds from the Tuileries and maybe 300 yds to the Louvre. The hotel rooms are small but the bathrooms are stunning and it was very clean bright and modern. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we preffered to go out to a cafe of which there are many close by. Having walked all over Paris there is nowhere which is better located as a base and we will most definitely be back. Thank you for helping to make this a weekend of a lifetime. I decided to join TripAdvisor because of this hotel, as i wanted to spread the word. I cannot recommend this hotel more. From arriving (very easy to get to), to the standard of the rooms (Hermes in the bathroom) and a shower so good, that i suggested to my other half that 'we should just stay in and keep taking showers', instead of going out for dinner. I have a slight cleaning OCD (to the extent that i have a robot vacuum at home to help me) and i couldnât find a speck of dust, fingerprint. Immaculate. I should mention that we were upgraded by the very nice manager Igor. He couldnât have done more to help us! When we go back to Paris, we'll head straight here. We were upgraded to the carres suite upon arrival which was a nice surprise. The hotel is bright, white and very clean. Our suite was a duplex and the best part was the French windows that open out to a quaint balcony with table and chairs. Location is great,2 min walk to tuileries metro stop and with plenty of dining/ shopping on the doorstep. Hermes toiletries are provided and the mini bar is well stocked. Only thing missing is a kettle! We had a wonderful stay. The hotel reopened 4 months ago and so everything is pristine and unused. Visit soon!! The location of this hotel is wonderful, ideal for moving around Paris centre, both for business and for visiting the prestigious museums and other monuments. The staff have been very attentive. The location of this Hotel is amazing, it is one of the best location in Paris, the street is very quiet and close from everything !! The staff is very nice and the deco is 1st class. But the most amazing is the Confidential suite...Our room was amazing, maybe a bit small but very very convenient and decorate with taste and taste...So romantic and so Fantastic, we do higly recommend it !!!!!! We can't wait to go again and try another room !!! Do not hesitate !! We have spended just one weekend, but it was great. The rooms are really nicely decorated, the location was perfect and amazing! they were nice!! Nice people in Paris, amazing. For those who say that the rooms are too small, what can I say... welcome to Paris! It's part of the city. The bathroom was great! and huuuuuuuuge. I took such a long warm shower... the only thing that I would change would be the breakfast. They have two options: express or normal. The express is too ""express"" for the 13Ã¢âÂ¬ you have to pay. And the normal one, 26Ã¢âÂ¬ didn't seem amazing for such a price. Maybe would be better to go to a cafÃÂ© to have breakfast. But I loved it, great design... definetely a great place to stay. I am giving 5 stars only because there is not a 6 rating! This hotel is a treat to visit, with a location that is unmatched (almost directly across from the Louvre). The rooms are perfect, clean, and well-designed, with new, high quality furnishings, large comfortable beds, exceptional bathrooms, and every amenity and convenience provided for. The real treat is the staff, who are the most friendly and eagerly helpful people that you could imagine. They are truly committed to making sure your stay is perfect in every way. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxury and location in Paris. Le Pradey looked good on the website and they excelled our expectations. Although the room was small (Number 35) it lacked nothing. The design was great and the bathroom (again small) was modern and had a large shower. Breakfast was excellent, only downside was that it is served downstairs and so no windows, maybe in the summer months would be nice to have views. The location of the hotel is fabulous, 2 minute from the Louvre on a quiet back street. All the staff were very helpful and polite (unlike our second hotel, another review to follow for Hotel Power!). The only thing they could have done to improve our stay was to advise us not to go to the Crazy Horse show, we bought tickets through the hotel and it was awful (see review and don't go). If we return to Paris this hotel will certainly be on our list of places to stay. We looked at the other larger rooms and to be honest we were more than happy to have been in a standard room; small, excellent design, well equipped, fantastic bed and bathroom. Well done :) Being French and living abroad I had the opportunity to stay at le Pradey for 3 nights. I travel a lot and I am usually quite picky about hotels. The rooms are decorated in a very refined way and are very clean. The staff was very friendly with prompt reactivity to all my requests. I recommend going downstairs for breakfast which is very cosy. Shopping rue saint honore, visiting the louvre or walk in Jardin des tuileries takes 1 min by foot from the hotel. In summary, I think Le Pradey is a very good deal to stay in paris for a few nights. Beautiful small hotel located at a 5 minute walk from Louvre. Very friendly staff, absolute cleaningness in the room. Especially loved the tiny shampoos. The room was really small, but it had everything we needed. Including free coffee and cookies the whole day. Would recommend it. This hotel has not long reopened after a full refurbishment and they have done a beautiful job! It really is home from home which in essence what the hotel are trying to achieve. The decor is stunning and has a really nice feel to it from the moment you arrive. We were welcomed, our luggage taken to our room for us, free Wifi arranged and then left to explore our beautiful room. We were in room 42 a 'Tradition' room which is bright airy and decorated to a high standard with a good size bathroom and a great monsoon shower. 3 juliette balconies looked out onto the pictureqsue parisian street with a great view of the tuileries gardens at the end of the street. The corridors are dark but in a luxurious atmospheric way offering a dramatic contrast to the bright reception and mezzanine lounge areas (where free tea and coffee, magazines and a honesty pay bar are situated - nice touch!). Breakfast is served in the small but perfectly decorated vaults of the hotel offering a real variety with hot food cooked at your request. This was the perfect luxurious haven, much needed after a long day exploring the sights of paris - well located a stones throw from the Louvre, Opera House and much more. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel - it made our first wedding anniversary perfect! I made the booking by internet for 4 nights. Maybe this was not my best ideea. Especialy because there was no review on the website about this hotel. The price was high, but acceptable, among the other offers for a 4 star hotel. Becouse we were second rank citizens, coming from Eastern Europe, we had to pay in advance for the first night, like a kind of guarantee. In our country there is a saying: you have to pay in advance only when you go to the street woman. So, the hotel policy for Eastern Europe citizens is ""the money in advance"". I consider this an offence for me and my fellow citizens. The second mistake was the booking of a room, without knowing it's size. And we find the awful truth after paying in advance, at the reception, the first night: the room was smaller than my home bathroom. It has only 12 sq. meters, plus the bathroom, with 4 sq. meters. All the room space it's occupied by the bed. Around it two persons can not cross. And we had to live there for 4 long days and nights. We felt like in a prison. Above all, we could not see the room, before paying for it. That's scandalous. Pay attention, don't let yourself be fooled by the bar offer. We have payed for it much more than it deserves. We wanted to drink a coffee and a tea, and we where charged for an express breakfest with 26 euros! The heating in the room and bathroom didn't work the first night - in a 4 stars hotel! - and outside where 3 Celsius degrees. Another thing, that besides the other problems looks ridiculous, puzzled us: the complimentary bottle of water and chocolates where available only the first night, and the room maid did not complete each morning the toiletries we consumed - and we lived there for 4 long days and nights. I do not recomend this hotel to anyone. They want to make a fortune easy and quick, from stupid tourists, like me and other fools like me.",,,

We found office,building and grounds staff friendly and helpful. the room was in good shape and on the beach. Parking was good. With all this motel had to offer it was a great deal. Extended our stay from three days to seven, that is how much we enjoyed our stay. We will return to The Cove Motel each time we are in the Daytona Beach area. You don't have temperature control of your own room! It is controlled by the office. Which closes at 10 pm. So you are out of luck for anything after that until 8 am. This place is very outdated. Very Noisy. Could hear everything. The room had a musky smell to it. It flaired up our allergies. There was dirt and dust all over the air vent. They would not give us a refund! Nothing close by, Had to drive to get anything and get anywhrere. It's not fancy bay any means but it is good value. It is right on the beach, not a huge place. Every room has a view of the Atlantic and they all have a full kitchen: full size fridge, stove woth oven, microwave, 2 double beds or 1 queen. This is our 8th year here and we intend to come back again next year. My wife and I stayed here for a week vacation. The Cove Motel is one of the old style motels in the Daytona Beach area. The ocean front efficiency we stayed in was a patched together type efficiency and not a true efficiency. The bathroom had about a 3 foot square piece of plywood on the ceiling and gave my wife an uneasy feeling. I checked it out and found this to be an access panel for the duct work but nothing to be concerned about. There was no ventilation fan in the bathroom being this is an older motel so you have to leave the small screened window above the tub open. This motel still uses a standard key for the door and not the updated security locks. The bed was very comfortable but was only full size and not queen size as expected. The Staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and the Ocean view was great. The free wireless internet had a 3 bar signal from our location and worked good. For the price that we paid I consider the Cove to be an average value. I consider the Cove to be one of the nicer kept old style motels. Although we enjoyed our stay we would look elsewhere next time around for a more up to date hotel / motel. This is the fourth year in a row that we have stayed at the Cove Motel.It's very clean.All the help is very nice.A great pool or you have the ocean a few steps away.I travel with my grandaughter and daughter so we like to stay where we feel really safe.Usually we go in June.But this year the way our vacations fell we had to go in July.It was a little to hot..I highly recommend this motel.We can't wait until next June.

HannuVantaalta,73869,"OK, you can't really expect anything fancy for $30, but somehow I did expect little more. The room was very basic, but mainly clean. The nearby highway was very noisy and the single windows of the room were not able to keep that noise outside, thus resulting to a rather badly slept night. The staff at the reception, however, was very friendly and helpful! I am a BIG fan of Hard Rock Cafes (visited more than 50 HRC's around the world), so naturally the Hard Rock Hotel was my choice on my trip to Las Vegas. But what a great disappointment it was. It started right from the check in and continued throughout my two-night stay. The staff was unfriendly in every department. The room was OK, but not very well maintained: the safe was not working at all, the desktop lamp switch was broken and the internet access cost $15/24hrs and it didn't work either! The most I have paid before that for the internet access had been $3/24hrs, but usually it is totally free. A maintenance guy came to my room to fix the internet connection and took at the same time the desktop lamp with him to get it fixed, with a promise to bring it back later that day. Well, I never saw that lamp again. The pool area is nice but they only had about 1/3 of it open (the nicest parts remained closed), although the pool chairs were practically 100% occupied. I got the impression that the hotel was not doing very well at all and it reflected to the staff. In order to compensate the declining occupancy levels, the management had decided to charge extras where ever possible (internet, $15 ""resort fee"" per day...) resulting dissatisfied customers, like me.

I was concerned about the safety of my car and myself. It is the biggest facility in the United States that Motel 6 has, I was told by the clerk. The bed was acceptable, but not great. The faucet in the bathroom sprayed water all over the place, and the floors were just so so as far as being clean. The doors had dents in them as if someone had tried to kick them in. The water pressure was great in the shower!! TV sound would not go except on a few chanels so could not watch TV stations I wanted to watch w/o disturbing other guests. I did not use the pools or other facalities. I would NOT recommend staying at this motel 6. There is one closer to Metro Center that looks smaller and nicer from the outside, that one might want to try, and the prices appear to be the same. I picked this hotel originaly because it was close to the place I needed to be. OK, you can't really expect anything fancy for $30, but somehow I did expect little more.

No matter what I asked for they were there to help. Denise, Melissa, and Able the security guard were especially helpful! The price was certainly right for a no frills accomodation. Restaurants are not too far away on major streets. I would recommend this hotel for the personal service alone. They ALL made me feel very welcome!",,,
Allison M,228572,"We stayed at Kensington Park Hotel for the last 4 nights of our honeymoon. The staff was very helpful with our bags, suggestions of what to do, and providing us with champagne glasses, etc. when we asked. We stayed on the 10th floor in a corner suite and the view was great. There was some city noise, but nothing outrageous. The room was comfortable and clean, although the bathroom could use some refurbishment and the selection of cable channels as well as the quailty of the signal has some room for improvement. The complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings was nice, although make sure to stop by Cafe la Taza a couple doors down to get a freshly cooked breakfast. The hotel is within walking distance to the cable car and BART, and of course Union Square. We would stay here again! Loved this place and wish we could have stayed longer! The room was clean, updated, great and the people were friendly! The view and proximity to the ocean could not have been better! Will definitely stay here if ever in the area again! The hotel is located conveniently in a quieter area of Barcelona, without being far out. The rooms are modern and clean, and the staff was friendly. The breakfast was delicious with lots of warm choices in addition to the spread of cold cereals, fruits, cheeses, and meats. For a treat, try to get one of the 2 rooms on the top floor. You may have to walk your luggage up the last flight of stairs, but the JETTED TUB, huge terrace and fantastic view of Barcelona is worth it! This hotel was in a wonderful location, however the service was not good, there was a fire alarm in the middle of the night and the hotel offered no discount or apology and the room was not worth the money. The resturaunt was beautiful and had wonderful food, however the service was terrible. It took 45 minutes to get our drinks. Again, great location, poor service, poor facility. Great hotel! Location is close to all the essentials and it was overall very convenient. There are a number of fantastic bars and restaurants in the area. The staff is friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are very modern (no bathtub). Definitely recommend to budget conscious travelers. My husband and I stayed in a suite here the first 3 nights of our European Honeymoon. The location was OUTSTANDING, and the suite was very nice also. The first day our sleep was off so we woke up at 10pm and roamed the streets of Rome until 3am. One of our favorite memories is walking to the Vatican that night while no one was there. We had dinner, visited the Vatican, and sipped wine on the street until 3 am. We never once felt threatened or unsafe. I highly reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in a great location. The restaurants nearby offer a delicious menu and true Roman food. Each night we slept with the windows open and listened to the hustle and bustle of the city life. To some this may not sound appealing, but to us it was a nice difference from what we are used to.","The hotel is located conveniently in a quieter area of Barcelona, without being far out.

Apart from the fact that should not have been consindered as a 4 star, but rather a 3 star hotel, there are some other points I would like to refer to, based on my recent unpleasant visit to this hotel. The only reason for writing this review is that I believe this hotel is an insult towards customers and travellers. Our stay's duration was 7 days and as the days were passing the things did not get any better, on the contrary became even worse. To begin with, our room did not have any internet access and thus I had all the time to move to the reception in order to check my business emails. In addition, the sheets were not extremely white-clean and room service did not visited the room for a couple of days without any reason. Furthermore, the sound isolation was really bad. Moreover the toilet rubbish bin was broken from the beginning and althouth reported several times never got replaced. The response time of the reception was extremely slow and the staff generally speaking was quite rude. Last but not least, the worst thing that happened was this one time that the room service did not visited the room and the toilet paper run out, after my request and delay of 30 minutes and a second call to the reception, one of the staff opened the door and entered without even knocking! Because I would not like to refer to only negative issues, althouth these seem to remain in memory, the hotel had rich breakfast, really spacious bathroom, reasonable pricing, it is near the centre of the city, but apart from these nothing special. Based on my personal experience, I would NOT recommended it under no circumstances! We wanted to stay on the Ramblas to be near the centre of the city knowing that it had Gaudis work there and to basically have lots of Sangria and see the Sagrada { unfinished cathedral.} My agent didnt tell me that we were going to this"" out of town"" horrible hotel . I found out when the taxi drove us there after our 4mths of travel. We were short of money but not worried because breakfast was included and we had paid for a city tour before we left home. Now we are very fit walkers but we are oldies and the hilly walk to the Ramblas and Guell Park in 38 degrees nearly killed us. Our city tour didnt turn up and we waited for 2 mornings. The receptionist didnt want to help . It was though she didnt like Australians. When it was time to leave they wouldnt give us a late checkout and we werent going to fly out till 6pm a long trip Barcelona-London- sydney. As it was so hot i went into the toilets to wash myself before the trip home and the receptionist followed me in. I dont normally be critical of staff because they are a plentiful commodity and they move on but this experience ruined our only visit to Barcelona. We had a view of rooftops and the bathroom was narrow. I wouldnt advise people to go here unless you love a long walk to see something worthwhile. This hotel is part of a large chain that has hotels all over Barcelona. This one's in a middle-class suburb, you can reach the centre by a bus or metro (allow 30 minutes). We were in no rush and quite liked seeing everyday life, and there's some nice cafes for breakfast nearby. The hotel itself is not 4 star by UK standards- on our first night we were put in a room with a blocked sink and it really smelled, we complained in the morning and were told they would fix it but when we returned in the afternoon and spoke to the (different) shift manager there was no note about about it, but he was very apologetic and moved us to another room immediately. We also got a 6am wake up call for a group from Australia we had nothing to do with. The hotel was full of groups, and I would say it's more suitable for group tours than for couples. Apart from these little let-downs, I would say it's good value for money if you don't mind staying a bit out of town. Stayed for 4 nights, would consider more an irish 3star, but for a city visit was great, staff lovely , porters friendly, rooms very clean, didnt eat there so dont know. The distance to city centre was 10mins on bus approx depending on traffic, Bus stop outside the door, Bus service brilliant. Quiet at night , nice bar next door , good cafes for breakfast very near and supermarket close too. Overall great location and was much cheaper than city centre, If travelling from airport on coach, the no 58 takes you from very close to aircoach stop to very close to hotel. On your return to airport make sure you get correct bus going to your TERMINAL. there are 2 Over all had a brill time and would send friends to same hotel I've really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I was in Barcelona for a vacation, and this hotel was perfect. The room is very big, and very clean. The staff is very kind and willing to help. As I arrived very early in the morning, they've immediately offered to have my room ready several hours before the official check-in, and indeed, it was ready by 11. The room was very clean, spacious, great wi-fi connection. There's a mini-bar, but I didn't use it. As to location - the hotel is not in the loud centre of town, but you can easily walk (lovely sights) or take a 10 mins ride on Metro (El Putxet station is just minutes away). Perfect if you want to party and return to a quiet area to sleep. Breakfast was nice, though admittedly I'm not much of a breakfast person and am happy with pretty much anything. Bottom line: a very nice, clean hotel in a resedential (but very lively area, full of coffeshops and restaurants!) area, perfect for a good night sleep. Great, huge rooms and bathrooms!",,,
xenagurl,231523,"Nice little hotel centrally located to make getting around easy. About 20 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from the port. A good hotel for pre and post cruise stays. Taxi is about 15 Euro to the Port which includes the entrance and exit fee. The Wifi Connection is good and the front desk staff very helpful and friendly. There is also free access to a nearby offsite gym however I didn't use it. Safe area about a 20 minute walk from Las Ramblas and near the stop for the HoHo buses. A tad noisy if your neighbors are up late and the elevator a bit slow. I'm not sure if the safes are functional (mine wasn't) but all in all nothing to complain about and I will be booking again for a future trip. There's a nice little Supermerkat?Supermarket across the street where you can pick up water bottles for your cruise if you choose. I stayed at this hotel in November 2011, after taking the train from Rome. Friendly staff, clean, nicely decorated, good breakfast, and great location. All in all lovely! When you come out of the train station I took the long route (I hear you can skip a bridge) but you go right. Cross a large bridge, arrive in the area with the buses. Go towards the vendors selling Venetian wares, walk through that area, go right, cross the larger or the two bridges and make another right. It's right past the hotel Arlecchino. Ask ""Picasso"" to draw you a map of local restaurants that you should try :) It would be nice if you could turn the little blue light off at night (where the key goes to turn the main lights on in the room) Other than that, no real issues.","If you don't mind a really tiny room (mine was 7 square metres) this is a good place to stay in Barcelona. I requested a balcony and if I hadn't had that, I couldn't have stayed there. My room had the smallest shower I've ever seen. I could get inside but couldn't turn right or left after that. The location is excellent because I can walk to most places I want to visit. The neighbourhood has plenty of bars, restaurants and shops. The cleaning staff is very active--I had to tell them not to bother every day as I didn't want to be disturbed. The rest of the staff is also very good and helpful. The breakfast (5.80) is probably a better deal than what's available in the neighbourhood. They probably have some rooms that are larger than mine but the receptionist said that basically all are small. If you're spending all day away from the hotel, maybe this isn't important to you. I stayed at this hotel during MWC event in 2012. During this time, 64,000 exhibitions visitors came to Barcelona requiring accommodation which lead to the natural inflation of the hotel rates. This two-star hotel charged me Euro180 per night. I personally would not pay more than Euro50 if it wasn't a business trip. Pros: - I found the hotel location excellent, very close to a metro station (line L2 and L3). Only two stops from the Fira (Espanya metro station). - the room was clean and spacious (it was a twin bedroom). I was told by a colleague that in contrast the single bedroom is ridiculously small. - Walking distance to Ramblas (popular tourist spot) - Even though I had my window open, the street was relatively quiet and I slept well. - The shower had strong water pressure and hot water. Cons: - There was a TV screen which seemed no more than 21"" LCD suspended from the ceiling. Only Spanish channels were available so I never watched any TV there. - The rooms had virtually no sound isolation, I can hear every word my neighbors were saying, sneeze, toilet flush, etc. - The toilet is clean, but the sink was tiny and you had to sit at angle when doing your business as the bathtub was in the way (see pic). Nice little hotel centrally located to make getting around easy. About 20 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from the port. A good hotel for pre and post cruise stays.

There's a nice little Supermerkat?Supermarket across the street where you can pick up water bottles for your cruise if you choose. close to everything in barcelona........ nice people working there........... the rate was amazing............. will definitely stay there again next trip to barcelona...... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Found hotel by chance and was amazed at the price, as on past experience hotels seem expensive in Barcelona. Single room with bathroom was compact but adequate, and very clean. Friendly, helpful staff, free Wifi in room which worked well. Close to metro Paral.lel and only a few minutes walk from La Rambla and from the waterfront. Noisy plumbing as per other reviews, but noise reduced by closing bathroom door at night. I check-in early and the room was ready, which is great when you get in BCN at 8am. The hotel & room were very clean and the staff was very friendly. They all seem to speak English although the tolerated my Spanish. Metro stop Paral-lel was short walk away and it is about a 10 minute walk to La Ramble and Barrio Gotico. I will gladly stay here again. Good value. I stayed there while competing in Barcelona Marathon.. Hotel is easy to locate in nice quiet location yet 2 minutes walk to Metro and Bus stop and 15 mins walk to Ramblas , Marina etc... Staff were very friendly with excellent English.... Single room compact but all was in order; bed comfi , great shower etc....Lift in hotel is very slow and even though I was staying on the 5th floor it was quicker for me to walk up and down the stairs.... Only advice I'd give is Do Not under any circumstances pay for breakfast... Its basically non existant and cost me 8 euro per day as I booked hotel through travel company... There's a supermarket directly across the road and a couple of coffee shops nearby ... Overall I found it an excellent place to stay and was also very reasonably priced... I stayed here for 3 nights in September 2010 in one of the single rooms on the 5th floor. Good points: - It is a 1 minute walk away from Parallel metro station from where you can catch a metro to the old city or can walk it in 10 mins! Also, easy bus access to the beach. easy access to the parc je olimpic via the funicular at Parallel station itself - The room although small was neat & clean. 24 hr hot water with a great shower & small bathtub Bad points: - The elevator is the slowest i ahve ever seen. It takes 5 minutes to come down 5 floors! - don't buy water from the machine in the hotel. it is very expensive. I paid 55 euros per night even though i booked a week before coming. Quiete location with plenty restuarants in area.5mins from La Rambla and sea,3mins from metro>Hotel very quiete but cleaners start early(10AM circa).Small room but had all one needs and very clean.Would be better value if breakfast included in price even if continent.Wi fi extra 6 euros bit stingy,but I was content overall and if you want somewhere clean,cheap and location etc,I would recommend it.",,,
texastravelgal54,617995,"We arrived to the hotel not knowing if we had picked out a good location or not? The location was good for us real close to the kenmore subway line and right across the street from Fenway park. The hotel elegant and quite, they offered breakfast and it was nice. We would stay here again if i come back. This place was exactly what i excected it to be clean comfortable and cheap!! The breakfast was perfect and free every morning. The bar in the main hotel was the greatest....the day bartender ""ELLEN"" what can i say we just loved her!! I hope to some day go back and i will stay at this hotel again!! The location was perfect, it was with in walking distance of every thing you could want food and drink and just people watching!! LOVED EVERY MINUTE Holly Bryan Fort Worth Texas","i stayed here for two nights and cant complain the rooms were abit small but u get used to it. nice place would go back again :) It's slap bang in the centre and close to the main attractions. Its clean, its safe, and it had a good atmosphere in the bar. The staff are friendly enough and its is cheap. Its a no frills experience in the room but the beds are comfy and there is a tv with various cable channels. You do have to share a toilet/shower room but there are only four rooms on each floor and each floor has its own seperate toilet and shower. If you want to have more facilities then pay the sky high prices of other hotels in the area, otherwise save your money and stay in this no frills but pleasant enough little hotel. Located right in the Redlight District ""De Wallen"", admidst pubs and eateries this hotel offers clean rooms with shared facilities. It is managed by Laura, a straight forward woman who makes sure that everything in the hotel is running according to her guidelines. While the breakfast room doubles as an authentic english pub in the evenings, steep steps lead up to the first and second (and third?) store where the rooms are located. While the rooms and facilities are kept reasonably clean, they are certainly not on the spacious side of life. No problem if one is out of house for most parts pf the day. Televisions in the rooms are placed immediately under the ceiling, which makes watching a little bit of an artistic exercise. But then again, you are not in Amsterdam for watching TV.. All in all a recommendable place to stay for a couple of days. It is the worst hotel which I ever met. I will never stop any more in this hotel. Very small and very cold room; very big cracks in windows; a shower on a floor, water in a shower is cold or very hot (normal was never); a rusty watering can sticks out in the wall, water splashes in different directions, to get under the water stream is impossible; ventilation in shower is terrible, in three minutes after turning on the water all is filled up with steam. The breakfast is tasteless. The staff is rough. From pluses Ã¢â¬â wi-fi and immediate proximity to railway station. I have only one photo of a room. It was impossible to make other photos, because the room is very small. Old Nickel Amsterdam Ã¢â¬â never stop there!!! I spent a night here and easily found the hotel from Central Station. It's most conveniently situated, with lots of good eating places within 50-100 metres. The downstairs pub has an excellent selection of good and unusual beers, and my reception was friendly and professional. My single room was tiny, but perfectly sufficient. All was clean, and sharing a bathroom wasn't a problem. There was some noise in the early hours from returning residents (it was a Saturday night) but ear plugs worked well. I would definitely stay here again if visiting Amsterdam. Low price for a great location and limited services. If you want to avoid hostels and stay in a twin or double room without great service or great facilities, that is your place. It is definitely not clean (old carpet, etc), but for a good price it is a perfect decent place to stay. If you are looking for some luxuries, you won't find them there. If you want just for a good price a bed, decent shower and toilet and a good breakfast, you will get it for a very reasonable price. We stayed in a different building in the same street than the reception (a pub). Much better, I'd say. It is called ""Schagen"". They gave us keys (warning us about lossing them) and we could enter or leave in any moment. It is like having a little apartment for few days. But this has a bad point if a crazy british guy starts to freak out at 5 in the morning in other room, shouthing and beating. There is no reception to complain (the pub it is closed for some hours during the night). The breakfast, served in the pub, is two eggs with bacon, toasts with jam and tea/coffe. No juices, fruit or other stuff. Good for me. Towels are provided and changed everyday; I'm not sure about sheets (they appeared straigthen). The shared facilities are ok; good shower. The staff is people just of few words, not very funny, but never rude. Smoking weed and hash is allowed in the rooms if you ""open the window"". By the way, the coffeshop in front of the hotel is crap, the worst in the town. Rude and stupid staff, small variety. AVOID IT. Waste of time and money; much better places in the area (the location is great). The hotel is fab, right in the heart of everything, a bit noisy but thats what you get for being right in the middle of everything, the service was excelent, the staff lovely, and i will defo be going back there to stay, very good value for money, The showers take a bit of getting used to, my advice turn the cold on full, then just a little turn of the hot tap, but be carefull it does get very hot. The hotel was very clean i could not fault it, and Amsterdam is a fantastic city. First night was very noisy with some guests arriving at 3am then all taking showers (one shower per floor) as walls are paper thin we were woken for some time! rooms only have single beds so bare this in mind if you are a couple ;-) breakfast was simple but fine with bread butter jam, fried egg and bacon and coffee. Rooms were very warm which was great as amsterdam was sunny but cold when we stayed! beds were comfortable but rooms were small but expected for the price. The downstairs of the hotel was the best part as it is a brown cafe with 60 beers on offer! When you come back after a night out its nice to be able to get a drink in your own private pub! :-) one main problem was the showers which really need sorting as there are only 2 settings boiling hot or freezing cold! I would stay here again for location and price are great! This place was exactly what i excected it to be clean comfortable and cheap!! The breakfast was perfect and free every morning. The bar in the main hotel was the greatest....the day bartender ""ELLEN"" what can i say we just loved her!! I hope to some day go back and i will stay at this hotel again!! The location was perfect, it was with in walking distance of every thing you could want food and drink and just people watching!! LOVED EVERY MINUTE Holly Bryan Fort Worth Texas we stayed here in 2005... when you walk in to the hotel, the reception area is a bar! this was great at night at everything in amsterdam closes by 1am I believe and the lady at the bar told us if we were not back by 2 am we sleep in the street... the room was comfortable, 4 twin beds and a sink on the wall. there was a community shower right next door to us, with water so hot that we actually set off the fire alarm with the steam! very clean and comfortable hostel. This place was recommended to me by an unlikely source, a French woman who seemed to value elegance and wine over seediness and beer. I took her advice and while I don't regret it, I would not really go back again. I was there mainly to be near the train station for my 24 hour layover. The room was spare and noisy, and the whole place had a layer of grime.",,,
Normala,1508373,"Hotel is very clean, staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel is a bit far away from the sightseeing attractions but taxis are aplenty and its near a Metro station. The nearby Ibn Bathuta Mall is great and plenty of eating places..a bit pricy, but.. affordable. Rooms are standard and ok overall. The only grouse that we had is the shower is too small. The non commital attitude and non smiling face of the front desk reception is really an issue.. when we checked in he was on the phone for almost 3 or 4 min, ignoring us and only gestured us to sit down after a few minutes and continued with his conversation over the phone. Check in was no hassle since we'd booked the rooms thru booking.com. The hotel keeps our passport as security for payment. We paid for our rooms in full and get to keep our passports. I wonder why they can't keep copies of our passports as most hotel do.. or a copy of our credit card.. they refused these suggestion. The metro station is about 15 to 20 minutes walk from the hotel.. good for walking during winter.. not in summer I think. Shops and restaurants are plenty and within walking distance Taxies are aplenty too... Overall.. it's an ok trip for us; except for the front desk service.","very clean and nice hotel. close to Ibn battuta mall and quite area. all services are nearby I've lived and worked in the UAE since 2006 and ended up living at Ziqoo service apartments for 6 months from end of 2010 to beginning of 2011. I initially chose Ziqoo over other serviced apartments due to the very competitive rate, I saw others that charged the same and more but who realistically should have been charging half!! The rooms are well equipped, clean and serviced everyday without fail. The kitchens are also fully equipped with washing machine, cooker, large fridge/freezer, microwave and plenty of cupboard space. Having lived in the UAE for a few years I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent customer service at Ziqoo, it has to be one of the best I've experienced here, even compared to 5 star hotels, the staff always seemed genuinely pleased to help. If I had to say anything negative then it would just be the lack of a swimming pool, but hey we can't have everything! There is a gym though and ample free car parking. Since it was my first trip to Dubai even any Mid east, I had less information, so I had asked many questions through email to staffs here before trip. And they kindly responded me quickly for every asking. I think This is Japanese hotel Merit. Location is bit far from center of Dubai, however it's no problem if you use Metro or Taxi. I recommend for someone who requires hospitality as a matter of first priority when staying hotel. it's very comfortable... privacy is highly observed... near everything u need... domino's. subway, groceries, malls, arabic restaurants and mosque... very relaxing and ideal for those who just want to get away from the city' hustle and bustle... i will certainly come back again... I was really astonished with the design, although the entrance and lobby is small but its very quite and friendly, i liked the way staff are treating customers, so clean, gr8 rooms with everything you need u will find and modern. Also its location is not far from city center, and near to Eben Battouta Mall... What is mostly needed there is the availability of internet service in rooms :) 1. Add a karaoke in the second floor of relaxation room. 2. Upgrade and improve Japaniese style restaurant decoration and food. 3. Hire some younger female Japaniese employees at reception. Thier service level is almost same in that of Tokyo. Thanks to excellent staff, you can realize confortable stay in Dubai. I will have chance to stay in Dubai in August, of course, I will stay there again if possible. They have all necessary amenities for business trip in room. Washing machine, refregerator, mini-kitchen, etc. I have never been to such HOTEL even in Tokyo. I would like to say thank you to all Ziqoo staff Hotel is very clean, staff are very friendly and helpful.

A refurbished Holiday Inn in the Central Business District, my stay was on the first night of Mardi Gra so both the hotel and New Orleans were pretty busy on a Saturday night. My room was on the 16th floor with a good view of downtown (the lower floors are the garage level so there's plenty of parking). My room was very clean had two Queen Anne Double beds, TV and a decent bathroom. Breakfast is served in the downstairs restaurant and is good quality. The hotel is around 12 blocks from the Amtrak Station, handy for the Super Dome and a short walk from Canal St and an easy walk to Bourbon St and the French Quarter. Despite negative publicity i felt perfectly safe walking around the area and walked back from the French Quarter at 2am with no problems. There is a free shuttle to the French Quarter and other points which runs hourly until 10pm which the hotel staff encourage guests to use. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall a great experience and i wouldn't hesitate the use the hotel again in the future. The Wolcott hotel is one of New Yorks hidden secrets despite its Midtown location. I first stayed at The Wolcott in 1998 when it was one of the cheapest hotels in the area, 2012 was my third stay at the Hotel and decor wise it doesn't seem to have changed a great deal during the intervening years, the hotel as the air of having seen better days but its still good value for money. The Wolcott is located on West 31st St between Broadway and 5th Avenue and is in easy walking distance of The Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Times Sq and the theater district.

Reception staff were friendly and helpful though when we asked one receptionist to book us a taxi for early the next morning he didn't do so.

I didnt even have a shower as i rather stayed dirty! maybe a room with a bathroom would have been better as you wouldn't have to deal with other people's wee and puke. Good: as regards price: 100% cheap as regards the service: 89%% helpful & attentive. as regards location? 100% perfect central, great for hopping on the metro, shops, funny street performers &buying fresh food at the famous Boccaria market! Bad: a)during the night: howling drunks, prostitute hassling tourists b)the place needs a DIY man! I have spent only 1 night it was a horrible experience. starting with the fact that I reserved the room with booking.com for 55 euro and for my curiosity i asked at reception what is the price for a room. SURPRISE 45 EURO :)) the room was awful, no window, the walls filled with mold, the bathroom was infected terrible experience. I didn't had much expectation being a hostel but also it has to besome minimum conditions of hygiene I would strongly suggest not staying here ever! It is three flights of narrow stairs up to the reception, where the receptionist didnt speak english and the one that did was not helpful at all. The place is very run down and lots of things could do with being replaced or fixed. The shower on our level was broken and you had to hold it up yourself to use it, out of the two toilets on our floor only one was useable. Our room didnt have a window and when trying to use the power outlet, sparks came out. We stayed at the Pension Picasso for a long weekend after reading a few reports posted on varius web sites. It is cheap OK and bang in the middle of the Rambla but If you plan on visiting Barcelona do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. The external door at night is surrounded by prostitues and pick pockets. The staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude the safes don't work in most rooms and the shower on the floor we stayed on has a step down past a large open window that is damn right dangerous. The allyway at the side is noisy well into the morning. The photo's on most sites of this place are nothing like what you get when you arrive.",,,
HermanaLinda,226602,"I chose this motel because it was cheap. The internet price was only $55 for 3 people in one room with 2 queen sized beds. I also liked the free wifi promised on the website. When we got there we found out that the wifi was only free in the lobby. Since I did not purchase the wifi, I could not check the website to find out that it did, indeed promise wifi in the rooms. I have yet to find contact information to a main office to complain about that. Also, this motel was not quiet. The neighbors were noisy at all hours. The rooms were, indeed, clean. However, the room did not smell fresh. My son complained about an odor, but i did not notice it. We enjoyed our stay at the Loma Lodge. It was quite, clean and tastefully furnished. The rates were reasonable. My only complaint was not enough outlets to charge our laptop and cell phones. Free wifi but the connection was a bit faint. All in all, a good night.

The rooms could be a bit cleaner, but hey for $40 it's a great bargain...within walking distance of Old Town, and close to all other San Diego points. That's why we keep coming back (and bringing a bottle of Lysol to give it a quick wipe-down!)",,,
edyrp,232872,"We stayed at the Atlante Garden for one night before our cruise. It stands in the shadow of the Vatican, so if that is where you will spend time you can walk there from the hotel. The room was fine and surprisingly large for a European hotel. It was difficult to get in and out of the bath tub/shower as the tub was so huge and there was nothing to hold on to. I am middle aged and do not normally have a problem with this issue. There was a lot of street noise in the area all night long, and we needed to keep the windows open for air. The TV was small. It was impossible to open the door to our room without assistance, as there was a trick to turning the old-fashioned key. The key was on a tassel and most guests left it at the front desk when they left the room as it was cumbersome.The staff was friendly and helpful at every interaction. Within 15 minutes of arriving in our large, clean room, the phone rang. It was hotel management inquiring as to whether we found everything to our satisfaction. That set the tone for our stay. We didn't have a ""view"" from our particular room but it didn't matter. The hotel amenities, location, the comfort of the bed, fluffy towels, robes in the closet, etc., made our hotel a great place to come home to after a long day in the city. This hotel is a short walk to Union Square and the Moscone Center. I have had the pleasure of being a guest at this property numerous times, and I am still amazed at how magnificently maintained the property is. The rooms are large and beautifully renovated in a contemporary fashion. There are plenty of sockets for charging electronics. The air conditioning worked well, and they have added a ceiling fan to the room, which is a nice touch. The bathroom has been completely re-built, with a Toto toilet and large shower with two sprayers. The lighting in the bathroom is excellent. The bed is comfortable and the sheets are high thread-count for extra comfort. There is a large, full-length mirror in the room. The room and common areas of the resort were spotless. There is plenty of room for suitcases, in the closet, and in the drawers. There is also a lot of surface area on the desk and credenza in the room. The toiletries that are provided are generous at two ounces each. There was no outside noise in the peaceful hotel room. Around the grounds, the ponds, lagoons, bridges, nature trail, flowers, and golf course are impeccably groomed. There is some unobtrusive renovation going on outside. The staff was polite and helpful. There were delicious food options at the resort. What more could anyone want?

This hotel is a short walk to Union Square and the Moscone Center. The lobby of this hotel is like a woman who aged and didn't try to keep herself nice. You can still see her good bones, but little has been done to update it or make it beautiful. The room we had was quite small, and despite the fact that we had cool fall weather it was somehow humid in the room. The bed was comfortable, and the lamps had extra sockets on them so we could plug in all of our many chargables. Surprisingly, the bathroom is great: euro-modern, with good lighting, a marble double shower with room enough for two. It had a hand-held shower as well as a rain shower from above. Very nice. There is a full-length mirror in the room, and a good sized closet. Most of all, the location of the hotel stands out. It is half a block from Michigan Avenue, with it's many restaurants and magnificent shops. The hotel is convenient and had some nice ameneties. Hotel Siena was a welcoming and comfortable place after our cruise. The location was its first appeal. It is walking distance to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and the shops at Via Condotti. The hotel staff was helpful and most of them were friendly. As for the others, it's hard to be too friendly when the English is a struggle.They arranged our ride to the airport for the next day and helped us bring our (lots of) luggage up to our fourth floor room in several trips in their tiny elevator (normal for European boutique hotels from what I've seen). The room was clean and comfortable. It was small, which is also normal for European hotels, but we had all the space we needed. I liked the hardwood floor, which made the hotel room seem cleaner than most.The bed was comfortable. Keep in mind there is no A/C if you stay there in the summer. This was not an issue to us in early November, and there is a high-tech fan and a window one could open in the room.","An Italian friend of mine booked this property for me and a girlfriend. I travel a lot and would typically stay at Starwood properties due to my status but I wanted to have a more ""rustic"" Italian experience on this trip. I am very type A so am even to this day surprised I allowed my friend to book me in a hotel in which I was unfamiliar but I went with it. I am so glad I did! We arrived to this CUTE hotel which was conveniently located just steps from the Spanish Steps. We were met by smiles and attention by the hotel clerk who made us comfortable while our room was prepared. The hotel is small but couldn't be more charming. Our room was tastefully updated in modern ameneties and again, while small, made the best use of the space. The beds were comfortable, the hotel was quiet and in the morning, we had a lovely breakfast in the dining room which was included in the room rate. I am so glad we discovered this gem and will definitely be back!!! Very good hotel, well located between Piazza di Spagna and Fontana di Trevi. Nice clean and smart hotel near Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps - sights everyone wants to see. Helpful efficient staff. Welcome drink very welcome at 11pm. Modern rooms; wooden floors and b/w decor. comfortable beds. Lift small but this is an old building! adequate for 2 plus luggage. Nice simple breakfast, and pleasant service. 'good eggs', says my daughter, pun intended no doubt. Hotel a bit difficult to find- directions peter out at the end. Locals professed not to know, had to use iPhone. we would return.

Centrally located, staff was very on point, room was clean and nice. Awesome shower and decent size - nicely appointed. The complimentary breakfast was on point and the woman working in the break ate area- whose name I don't remember, was extremely pleasant and had a wonderful smile... And amadeus great cappuccinos. It was a delightful start to the day and left us well nourished in anticipation of a long day of Cobblestone hopping. Only downside, the walls were a bit on the thin side, and to be in a busy area, it could get a little loud. As someone who works in the hotel industry food the past 20 years, attention to detail is often in the forefront of my mind and this hotel passed my high standards. Even the professional pictures posted online are a perfect representation and I would have no trouble recommending this hotel. Good base for exploring Rome,few minutes away from Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountains.Little rooms but that's common in Rome,clean,chic and relaxing,breakfast bit average.Friendly and helpful staff.Definitely would stay there again! This beautifully updated, sexy little hotel couldn't have been in a better spot. We walked out our door into the thick of the most beautiful shopping, people and history in all of Europe. Great breakfast, wireless hotspot, enough said! cute little hotel about a 2 minute walk from the trevi fountain. as long as you're willing to walk, everything is pretty much walking distance. we booked the hotel last minute goingoff other peoples reviews on trip advisor and we were'nt dissapointed at all.",,,
EllesP,230573,"The hotel is ideally located in the hippest area of Istanbul; Beyoglu. The rooftop bar/terrace is a plus (but expensive, 7 euro for a glass of their cheapest wine). But the views are awsome, so it's well worth paying this money. And the small swimming pool is an extra bonus. The rooms are small, but funny en trendy decorated with a view,..wow! The airco was basically the only extreme negative point from our stay. It just did not work properly. The hotel was fully booked and we think the airco could not handle blowing cold air in all the rooms. We were given (no trouble, very politely) another room, but the problem was the same. For a hotel in this price category we were actually very disappointed. Because of the heat we haven't slept well for 4 nights. The breakfast was fantastic, mmmm still thinking of it. Never saw so many items and variety. Tumbs up! The staf is not only nice, some of the reception girls are gorgeous looking :-) Would we return, yes...but fix the airco please!! This hotel was perfect for us. Great price vs comfort. The location is not downtown Berlin, but with the tram in front of the hotel we quickly reached all the hot spots. The breakfast is great. Why? See my pics.The only complaint is the noise @ rooms facing the street. There is no airco, so with open windows the noise it horrible. We did not sleep at all. The next day we were moved to another room (on new years eve...full hotel) facing the court yard, thank god!, and we slept like babies.Great service. Hightlights for food: Vietnamese restaurant Si An @ Prenzlauerberg. The hotel lobby is fantastic. The rooms are spacious, the beds are a bit hard and I don't like the fact that they do not have seperate beds, only queen. The breakfast is really the highlight of this hotel. They have everything. The pool is also very nicely build with comfi chairs. The location is OK. Next time we would stay more towards the Walk because that area is more walkable and cozy.","This hotel was perfect for us.

Hightlights for food: Vietnamese restaurant Si An @ Prenzlauerberg. I stayed during the trade show ITB in March at this property. My room was in the main building on the 5th floor with a nice balcony, facing the cross street. I slept with the window open, traffic noise wasn't too bad. The room was spacious enough for being a queen bedded room, large safe with plug inside, flatscreen TV, minibar, etc all good. Internet comes included in the room rate. All staff I met was very friendly, both at front desk and in F&B service. The bathroom was good too, with a real hairdryer and not one of those super small ones. Only thing I have to comment here is that in the shower the shower tube's tap was loose, and there was some painting to do above the mirror. Breakfast was served across the patio (this is a negative, as you have to cross a parking lot to get there - either take your coat or umbrella, it's about 100 yards so with rain it's long enough to get wet). Nice large breakfast buffet with an option of scrambled eggs, variety of cheese, sausage, breads, jams, muesli, etc. I believe in this building there is also more rooms as I saw another elevator and people getting out with luggage. I tried room service once, this was a negative. My order came incomplete, and plates were covered only with aluminium, not with the usual cloches that are placed on them. Thus, wasn't too hot anymore. Minestrone was ok, but the Cesar's salad was disgusting. Salad leaves were definitely not fresh anymore, sauce was very oily, chicken was minor quality and had a weird taste. Still would visit again, although definitely not for ITB as the location is not good. Next public transports SBahn is about 1km walk, and takes forever to get to central Berlin or even fairgrounds. To Alex / Brandenburger Tor etc by Taxi I'd calculate 10/15min. Very nice, cosy and romantic hotel. Reception extremely helpful, smart and nice presentation. Good food and reasonable price however limited menu. Matress and linens were very confortable and TV superb however without CNN! Room and B'rooom lights could be a bit stronger; however romantic if one wants it. Only negative of my room was the shower which could have used a good cleaning and there is no shoe cleaning kit available. I did not try B'fast. Remember when booking the hotel is in the East part of city therefore requires quit a taxi to the West areas. When visiting friend which now live in a flat in former East Berlin we those to try the hotel New Berlin. The only reason we had to choose this hotel was that it was only a 100 meters away from the flats belonging to our friends. However the hotel was a huge surprise. A very friendly and very informative information at the arrival. The whole hotel was very fresh and during our whole stay the service was amazing, in terms of perfect. The hotel rum was excellent. The whole hotel and the rooms had a very distinct architecture and down to the little thing it was genuine to its nature. The breakfast with no doubt five stars. Furthermore, in this area of Berlin you can go out to the little restaurants around the hotel. There you can find a very personal service and extremely inexpensive for a city like Berlin. For two persons with a three dish meal and water and a bottle of vine (1 liter and a very good Valpolicella) the cost was about 25 to 30 euro - altogether. Itâs not the last time we will those hotel New Berlin. The hotel deserves a five star with no doubt and the areas around the hotel with small restaurant, with tramp and bus â or walking you can reach practical most of Berlin. However to a cost here is only a fragment compared to other places I Berlin New Berlin Hotel is a Really very good Hotel, it is 4* and it really deserve it. Hotel location is not very central, but the tram M5 & M6 are 100 m. away, and from there it is a direct line to ALEXANDER PLATZ and more, If Prefer to take the S lines it is almost 15 min walk to Lendersberg Allee Station. The Hotel it self consists into 2 Buildings "" Classis & Mediterranean"" my room was in the Med. House, very spacious Room "" 404"" , very well equipped , Huge space, King Size bed, Nicely decorated bathroom, "" no tub"", TV is a normal classic one Not LCD, has almost 35 channels all in German language !! Mini Bar and Safe are existed into the room closet, Free Wi Fi, No Tea & coffee Facility. Breakfast was OK with good selection of food. Staff are excellent and Nice and ready to go the extra mile to serve you. Hotel Rooms "" or My room"" has No A/C , I think that will be very needed in the summer time. I also recommend the hotel to have bill boy service for the Luggage and Luggage trolly, I had 3 suitcases and there was only the Restaurant Waiter to help me with them "" Very nice of Him indeed"". reception staff "" the ladies"" are all exceptional.",,,

travelerfl0rida,239900,This is a great place to stay in New Orleans. The staff is very accommodating and makes the guest feel comfortable. The club lounge is relaxing after spending time in town. Will definitely try to stay here again. Initially I had a noisy room and they moved me without any problem. You can have an incredible staying here. The hotel is in a great location. I picked it based on the trip advisor rating and I was not disappointed. The staff is friendly and takes care of requests. The room was clean and warm. The bed was comfortable. There was a window seat with a great view of the river. Would stay here again.,"The Maison Orleans was formerly my favorite hotel in New Orleans, despite its lack of a pool. The hard wood floors and fireplaces in the rooms were exquisite and the lounge areas lovely and peaceful. That all changed when the Ritz acquired the property and designated it their club level. No more peace and excellent service. The staff are scattered and no longer as helpful and there are WAY to many children running around the lounge areas. What was once a luxurious oasis is now more like Disneyland. I will never stay there again as long as it remains the Ritz Club Level. My advice is to book a room at the Windsor Court and enjoy their newly updated rooms and the pool. (Though the pool service is atrocious) WC has the best bellmen in the city too. We stayed at Maison Orleans the week between Christmas and New Year's. It's the Club level of the Ritz Carlton. The rooms are lovely and spacious, especially the bathrooms. The lounge areas, both Club level and on the lobby level, are beautifully decorated. The issue I had, and it's not a big one (although these are very pricey rooms) is the location of the Club Level. Clearly this was not the original, intended design for the hotel because Maison Orleans is very hard to get to (""go up to level 4, turn this way, then that way, go through the door, round the corner and take the next elevator"" etc, etc). Each time we came and went, we nearly got lost. In fact, there are several hotels within this building and the lobbies are on varying floors with varying elevators. Overall, lovely hotel - just a very confusing layout. This is a great place to stay in New Orleans. The staff is very accommodating and makes the guest feel comfortable. The club lounge is relaxing after spending time in town. Will definitely try to stay here again. Initially I had a noisy room and they moved me without any problem.

EllenDelller,234923,"The building is beautiful and could not be better situated in the midst of the French Quarter on the relatively calm Royal Street. Despite the hustle & bustle outside, the room was very quiet and we only heard neighbors once when they were having a mercifully brief party. The rooftop pool is lovely and the exercise room small but adequate. However, at the high price, I would expect more bathroom counter space (there's practically none) and something other than styrofoam cups and plastic coffee maker. The bathrobes are a nice touch, but the towels are thin. The concierge was not available enough, and the desk staff-although very polite--were clueless about what must be FAQ's about trolley cars, directions, etc. Our go-to place in Berlin. Very clean and comfortable (fantastic FIRM beds), relatively inexpensive for a big city, fresh and ample buffet breakfast, good coffee, and an in-hotel bar that stays open really late and is a cozy place to end the day. Mostly youthful or young-at-heart clientele. Just around the corner (really about 90 seconds!) from trains and buses, but very quiet. Get a room on a higher floor, and you'll have an exhilarating view of Berlin.","Our go-to place in Berlin.

Get a room on a higher floor, and you'll have an exhilarating view of Berlin. I stayed in the hotel with my girlfriend as we were trying to stay longer in berlin so our options based on looking something affordable which made us consider this hotel as our option. starting with the one side of the coin,First of all,the hotel is ok, as its close to the train stations, so getting to the city centre or any part of berlin is a click on your finger tips,(big up for that), secondly, the hotel staffs were really really friendly and helpful, and thirdly, the breakfast was good over the hotel value. The other side of the coin is, The room they first gave us was less more value than a cheapest hostel you can ever imagine, but we complained on it then they gave us a top floor which was ok looking room, and those are the one you see on their hotel room images. other problem with the hotel was about the bed since it was kind of broken as you feel better sleep on the floor (since they dont have sofas in the rooms as you see on the picture) rather than the bed we found in the room. also there is no wifi internet reach in the top floor, so we were suppose to go down the bar/restaurant to get a wifi and this was such a disappointment i most felt. also the room TV have less than 4 boring germany channels only. another thing is the noice from the main road since their windows are not sound proof which forced us to wakeup early everyday as u can not sleep more than 6am and it was also supported with the sun light getting all in your room since the curtains were so thin. Therefore, i recommend this hotel to high school teenagers or something like that but not for couples or other backpackers since we found out that, in berlin there are alot other cheap hotels worthing the price. We booked this hotel for our stay while running the Berlin Marathon in 2011. The location is fine, its near clubs and restaurants although a little outside the center of Berlin. Its very close to transport so no compaints. The rooms are basic but clean. My only complaint would be that there are no blackout blinds so you wake up when the sun comes up. The staff are very good and friendly and helpful. The breakfast was really good and theres a good atmosphere in the bar in the evenings. Overall good option for a budget weekend but budget is the word! The East Side Hotel is a good Hotel for the price. It is in a trendy neighborhood full of nightlife and convenient to the train station. Our room had lovely view of the parking lot of a construction equipment company, but I don't travel to stay in the hotel room either. The only problem is that they're moving equipment pretty early each morning. The hotel is reasonably clean, not perfect, but you're not paying for a four star hotel either. I would skip the breakfast. It says they have wifi in all the all rooms, but we could only get anything useful in the lobby or bar. One word of caution, there's no air conditioning and no screens, which is not unusual, but it can be a problem if you are outrageously allergic to insect bites like me it can be a problem. I paid 60 Euros for three adults including breakfast. The rooms are large and clean with bath and a shower. TV in the room has premium Sky channels for 11.5 Euros per day. FREE high speed wi fi in every room. Good food and bar, 3.2 Euros for a large beer. Friendly, helpful staff, great views of the wall and the river. Expect road noise if staying at the front overlooking the wall. I highly recomend this Hotel, fantastic vaue for money. Don't let the cheap menu's fool you (max. 17 euro), because if you book via Daydreams (or Hotelbon) you get charged a fixed price for breakfast and diner of 43,50 euro per person. This is approx. twice the price if you eat a la carte, including drinks. They don't tell you this in advance. The surprise is yours when settling the account. Beside this we experienced an apprentice cook, because one evening the dinner looked and tasted different. Which was confirmed by the waiter.On three evenings there was no salad available. The mattresses in our room were rather thin, one could feel the springs through them. We complained to Hotelbon (Daydreams) without avail. They say they are not responsible for the product they sell.

Angear77,199433,"The one and only good thing I can say about this hotel is its just a few blocks walking distance from Rembrant Square, but thats it. The room was tiny and smelled, heater did not work. The bathroom door did not reach all the way to the floor, therefore there was no privacy. The shower curtain so moldy it stuck to its self in one big clump, nasty nasty, nasty. And for $116 US, outrageous. This Hotel is nothing like their website presents, not at all contemporary, modern or neat. The location was extremely far and inconvenient from central Berlin, two trams and bus to get to (took an hour), and the bus is constantly late and doesnt run past 12am. The room smelled musty and the chairs were stained. Breakfast was expensive and mediocre at best, cold eggs and bacon. Had the pasta dinner, had to send it back as it was undercooked (crunchy even), and they still left the item on the bill, and offered a shot of Ammerreto as a consellation, I declined and asked that the item be removed from the bill and they obliged (althoug I shold not have had to ask). Overall dissapointed and would not stay again nor recommend. This Hotel was in the heart of Cannagerio District, and walking distance from the St. Maria Train Station (with light luggage). The lobby and rooms were clean and bright, a bit off the main street which meant a quiet room. Friendly staff,gave us a map and highlighted most important monuments of Venice. Cons: since this hotel is set back from the main street there is no view and no air circulation in the rooms, in the hottest months this could mean difficulty sleeping, opening the windows will not help as this will allow the mosquitos full access. We were bitten several times during the nights we spent at this hotel, an inroom fan might have helped with the heat, we asked and they didnt not have any for us to use. Overall a nice hotel, I would stay again in more milder weather. Good value.","I stayed in this hotel in the end of 2008, I will offer my review of this site but look at more recent reviews as it may have changed. The hotel itself is a little away from the metro station but not a too long walk - maybe 15 mins. The hotel is a best western so you can expect cleanness and other basic facilities, there is also a nice little restaurant within the hotel - but its not owned by the hotel. There was all the basic stuff i wanted - TV, en suite and bed was comfortable. The staff were helpful. I would recommend this hotel, but for some people a more centrally located hotel would be better. This Hotel is nothing like their website presents, not at all contemporary, modern or neat.

Overall dissapointed and would not stay again nor recommend. We choosed this hotel because I take part in different loyalty programmes, and this was compreratively cheap option with possibility to get Best western rewards points as well as SAS Eurobonus points (checked out 21/11/2010 and points registered already 24/11/2010!). But it was a positive surprice that it was also easy accessible by bus Nr 171 directly from Schonefeld airport (bus station Zadekstrasse). Use the same bus + metro to travel also to the center of the city. Hotel looks very good â all is clean, perfect staff, rooms quite big. I was satisfied.",,,
earlifransiska,1216926,"they are very helpfull, they give info without being asked, they keep you updated with your request, they give excellent help, good sleep coz far from noisy rome traffice, take the metro, and your problem solved, coz rome is small and everything is reachable with the metro. rooms and all facilities are ok including the location as near by with the metro, and tourism spots, only thing is the receptionist attitude including the GM mr yousouf himself, we added 1 nite extra with the call from our room and it was confirmed, but the next day they asked us to pack up and check out, even a lady called and asked when would we leave. They had no regret on kicking us out. The hotel is fully booked, so I guess they are too confident their occupancy rate will always be high. rooms and all facilities are ok including the location as near by with the metro, and tourism spots, only thing is the receptionist attitude including the GM mr yousouf himself, we added 1 nite extra with the call from our room and it was confirmed, but the next day they asked us to pack up and check out, even a lady called and asked when would we leave.

Took single room, which was EXTREMELY small (took some pics and will try to upload). I felt like sleeping in a reconverted service room. Shower tub very narrow as well (and I'm fit). If you're really only there for sleeping though, as I was, this is probably enough, considering room, bathroom and common areas were all very clean. A few bleach stains on the carpet, which indeed make it look dirty at some spots (mentioned in other reviews), but on the other hand I like to know they use bleach... All members of staff were very polite, helpful and friendly. Breakfast is good and has enough variety: choice of cakes, pastries, cereals, breads, toppings (jams and chocolate paste), fresh fruits (both full and peeled+sliced), salads, eggs (boiled and scrambled... latter one a bit too dry in my opinion), bacon and sausages, juices (non fsh squeezed though), coffee/tea/infusions/chocolate. No restaurant for other meals than breakfast though. There is a bar (which I did not try). No wifi in the rooms, only in lobby: disappointing if there for work. I want to thank the peopel of your's hotel Arriana and Ramon, they are so kind and friendly and help us verry well!!!! Thank you from all my hart I went to this Hotel with my daughter for a three night stay and was dissapointed to find the twin room I requested was not available ( late rooms .com did not pass on the comments to the Hotel however the staff at the Hotel sorted it first thing in the morning, the Hotel is a very clean and modern with very obliging staff who were very friendly , the downside is that the Hotel is quite a bit outside Rome ( ten minute walk to the metro and a fifteen minute journey which is fine in the daytime but the trains finish at 9 pm and is very expensive if you take Taxis back to the Hotel from the centre of Rome, the most unfortunate point I have to make is that at night time the place turns into a Red light area with the garden at the Hotel entrance being used by the ladies of the night and their clientele, it is with great regret that this Hotels reputation is soured by its location but it is only fair to point it out to fellow travellers they are very helpfull, they give info without being asked, they keep you updated with your request, they give excellent help, good sleep coz far from noisy rome traffice, take the metro, and your problem solved, coz rome is small and everything is reachable with the metro. Carpet is filthy. Booked through Booking.com a Triple with garden view: no garden view, only one double bed with a single sofa bed, staff wan not very apologetical, but provided me with a cot that was no different from sofa bed. Breakfast was ok, but fruit a bit passed. Fittings need some maintenance. The Hotel Area in Rome has a very good quality price ratio. If you are ok with the basic needs (no restaurant, no gymn), but you are just looking for a clean and spacious room; then this hotel is for you. Compared with many other hotel in Rome, this one is very clean and the personell is incredibly friendly. Is not central, but is 10 minutes away from the metro (Marconi stop). If you look for an hotel in the same price range in Rome city centre, you'll probably find a low quality, not so clean place. We booked this hotel through ""top secret hotels"" and so we were a apprehensive about what we might be getting. We read some of the reviews and got a bit scared about prostitutes and nuns etc. The hotel is next to a convent school and opposite a police station but we saw no prostitutes and the area seemed like a typical suburban zone - quiet, a couple of shops, a school and not much else. Marconi metro stop is just off the bottom of most Rome city maps but once you find the station no real trouble getting to the hotel, just keep walking left from the station. All of the reception staff were exceptionally friendly and the hotel felt clean, crisp and new. Our room was very nice, good sized bathroom and clean sheets and towels every day. The TV is only in italian but who wants tv when youre on holiday anyway? We bought breakfast in the hotel everyday as there were no nearby supermarkets and the cafe close to the metro station didnt look very inviting. The breakfast was continental with a slightly odd twist, cold eggs and chopped up sausages but the pastries were beautiful and a massive selection of fresh fruit. The restaurant that the reception staff reccommend, Conventos, is brilliant. It is the only restaurant close by, about 2mins walk down an unlit alley way, but its well worth the alley once you get there. We happily ate there every evening and the food and service never disappointed, it was full of italians which we felt was a good sign. The Bucatini all' amatrice is to die for! I would recommend Hotel Area whole heartedly to anybody travelling on a budget but looking for somewhere a bit decent to stay, the only compromise is on distance from the city centre, but who cares about a 5 minute train ride? This is a modern boutique hotel situated a short walk from the Marconi metro station, a 15 minute journey from the main train station (Termini). Quiet residential area; a School, a Convent and a Police Station are the surrounding buildings. There are no shops etc in the vicinity. The room was clean and was serviced regularly; the room had a very small shower cubicle. Massive TV in room unfortunately the only channels available were Italian Freeview channels. Breakfast was satisfactory although it was charged as an extra. The hotel has a bar but no restaurant. We stayed in mid Jan 2011. The hotel is clean throughout. The hotel staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful, from booking taxis, booking restaurants etc, they made our stay! The continental breakfast has lots of variety with some very strange additions but tasty never the less. The hotel is a 7 minute walk from Marcconi station and there are some small shops nearby. One bad point was the hotel was a tad warm, but we opened the window in the room and it was fine. Oh if you stay go to a restaurant behind the hotel, go out of the hotel, chuck a right, walk down a hill and under a small bridge which brings you to a main road. GO right and there is a great restaurant. Proper home cooked meals and quite cheap. Dont get a cab you will get ripped off! Full of Italians, which is a good sign!. All in all a good hotel and would revisit. The only complaint regarding this hotel was that the room was really hot. We tried to turn down the radiators but the heat still kept pelting out. It was really cold whilst we were there but had to have the windows wide open most of the night. The room was not very big and neither was the shower. Overall the room regarding cleanliness etc was very good and the staff were really friendly and helpful. We stayed here on the last night of our Trafalgar tour of Italy. The hotel is reasonably modern and we had an enormous room. The air conditioning was not working but we could open the windows for fresh air, as it was a hot night. The bathroom was also very large, but had a tiny shower cubicle. I am petite but could hardly fit in the shower and my husband found it quite awkward. The hotel was clean and breakfast was fine and we had no complaints. It was okay for one night. We did not have dinner at the hotel as we went out for our farewell dinner. ....Hotel Lets put up things first. I booked the hotel by the prepaid not refundable offer but on the arrival day because of strikes on the airport our flight was canceled.Spoke with hotel and Areef and they change my arrival date and move my booking days without charce. Arrival on the hotel was Easy close to Marconi station 7 min walk. Annarita on the Reception and what a star she was!!!! Excellent smile worm wellcome on a minimal and beautiful lobby. She upgrade our booking on a much Bigger room 305. The room was Fantastic!!! Clean Neet Specious With a lot of natural light trow the big widows king size bed 32Lcd tv lounge area anda very clean bathroom(shower was great but a nice bath will top up everything). Breakfast was very good clean with a good sellection and Very Good Service from Both Ladies that always smile. Train to the city termini was 15 min and it was easy on saturday the metropolitana run until 1.30 which was great the rest days 11.30 was not so bad.But the bus is there from termini station and we use it on our last night cause we stay longer in the city No problem at all and also walking back to the hotel in the night did not worry me at all. I forgot to say a big Thank you to Annarita for solving the adaptor ""problem"" and gave back to my girlfriend her beautiful smile and Areef for all the info i needed about restaurants and etc. We would love to visit Rome again on day and if we do We Know where we gonna book and thats Prime Hotel Area!!!!",,,
sham55,1078457,"The hotel was very clean and the staff always happy to help and had a smile on. One in particular was Jerry, he was very helpful, i was there with my family and one member is wheelchair bound. The hotel is not fully accessible but if you can walk a little with aids its a brilliant place to go to. My son could not go into the bathroom as it was too narrow and to go by the pool there is a little step, this did not stop us from going as the staff were happy to help lift the wheelchair in. It has good choice of restaurants within, there was a big choice of breakfast and if you are a vegetarian you would not go hungry as there is ample to choose from. The hotel is very local to the shops, metro station and malls. I would go to this hotel again and recommend it.highly, four star hotel with five star service!! I would not give it a 4 star rating.has a rather nasty smell in rooms, breakfast was not good and there was mould on the bread!!! The area is nice and local, everything is walking distance which was good. Television didnt have big choice of chanels, The steam room was not working, sauna was never turned on had to wait for ages if wanted to use it. There were no towels or shampoo and shower gel in changing rooms and no one ever there to help in the gym!! Not value for money can get much better service elsewhere at this rate.","The room when you arrive is not ready and the reception staff make you wait for 1/2 hour while trying to get you into the ""sister hotel."" They seem to have no booking policy and overbook the hotel. There was an early check out (not suprising) and I had to wait for that room whilst it was ""Cleaned."" I was told to go for a coffee and given brief direction through a car park to a ""restaurant"" (more like a cafe.) The coffee was tepid and breakfast inedible and cold. Service was also non-existant. After a day we checked out and went to the Habtoor which for not much more money made a more pleasant stay in Dubai. The room had not been cleaned. The floor was dirty, levels had not been wiped . The cleaner only makes the bed and changes towels. Breakfast was a really lousy, same food every day, no vegetables at all. Pool area had 4 sunbeds and all of them was broken. Me and my Family booked the hotel Arabian suites.It was more than we expected.YOu dont get all those facilities in a room in dubai.I have stayed in all the hotel in dubai but never seen such spacious apartments an all facilities.YOu can even imagine that washing machine was also there and i used it all my stay.lol. Staff is very friendly and supportive.They care for you. Restaurant is small but the quality of the food is excellent and rrom service is also very good. Also wanted to mention that the Manager of the hotel Mr.Junaid is very coutous and friendly and he listen and than makes your issues solve just like this.Really deserve to be there as he is doing the best job.The best place to stay.Worth of money.and classic rooms.very quite hotel where you can relax and have a peace of mind.I will for sure come back . Stayed here for first night of stay in Dubai. Arrived early hours of the morning-Had no difficulty finding it from Airport. Rooms are very spacious and fully equipped. Very clean rooms and linen. Pool area was on the roof and very secure and clean-shame only 3 sunbeds! Service was ok and staff helpful. Didnt walk around area as transfered to Beach area for rest of holiday. Great value hotel and would recommend. Its basic but would stay again. Stayed with 3 year old child and friends. No problems. I would not give it a 4 star rating.has a rather nasty smell in rooms, breakfast was not good and there was mould on the bread!!! The area is nice and local, everything is walking distance which was good. Television didnt have big choice of chanels, The steam room was not working, sauna was never turned on had to wait for ages if wanted to use it.

Not value for money can get much better service elsewhere at this rate. arrived10.00 roomnot ready till 2.00 went to restaraunt for c0ffee while we waited for room had too walk thro carpark to restaraunt not a good start looked like a converted garage,we got to the room 1.00 wanting to shower after 7hr flight but their were no towels in bathroom rung reception useual response ""be there soon as"" . had to wait till 4.30 , had enough by then went up too the roof to go for a swim nothing like the picture on website,2 dirty sunbeds and a glass table at other end of roof space, disgusted, went back to room ,dressed, got in taxi, went to last htl we stayed,TOWERS ROTANA, which has a great restarant down stairs"" LONG BAR"" and also booked a room for our returned jouney from oz as we would definatly not go back to arabian suites I travelled alone, and overall, found this place quite good. I arrived really late at night and was expecting someone to meet and pick me up at the airport, but no one did. So I hopped in a cab, and gave then the name of the hotel which I thought was the ABC hotel. Taxi driver had no idea where this was, and even though I gave him the address we / he could not find it. Be careful with this - I think it's only just recently changed names! Anyway, I paid for a studio unit for two nights, and when I got to the hotel, there were none left, so they upgraded me to a one bedroom suite on the roof of the building, with a huge lounge, kitchen with laundry, and two bathrooms. I felt bad for taking it, as I'm sure there were families who were slumming it in 1 bedroom apartments. Anyway, the pool was ok, a little dusty and in need of a clean up there. Ok location. There's nothing much around, but then again, Dubai is huge anyway, and you're going to have to catch a cab whereever you go. Staff are mixed. I found roomservice and bell boys terrific. But the behind the counter staff were a little rude. One morning, I asked to be woken up at 7am. I woke up myself at 11am, so wasted an entire morning of my holiday. Thank god I wan't catching a flight that day! If you are in the same room, just beware that its next to the pool, so you get the sound of the pool pump all night! Selecting this hotel to stay in DUbai when i planned a visit for 4 days with my wife was the 1st best thing i did. What better was I got a gr8 deal online. SO it made the stay even more great and memorable. Positives of this hotel is its loation in d heart of the city, Good room service, Silent atmosphere, Spa services, Gr8 kitchnette facilities in room and yeah good food. All this for a very good value for money. Trust worthy staff is a big plus as well. if you travel to dubai and you dont want to spend a huge amount of money staying in luxury hotels zagy is the perfect place just bring earplugs with you.",,,
mariadivina23,1935836,"My 3 companions stayed there for 2 nights. Location wise its accesible to MTR & bus, just a little walk to avenue of stars where we watch symphony of lights. The room is clean, bathroom & linen. I have heard noisy neighbor. Its a good choice, been travelling to SG, not like in HK, accomodation much cheaper They offered distilled water too, just bring a tumbler, you just refill all you like. The room service is a fellow Pinay, we spoke the same dialect...=) I know its a cheap hotel. its my 2nd time in SG, you can hardly find with its price. Before i went a hostel, much dirty, no privacy, etc. I choose here coz its nearer to Airport. Just a little walk, bus are around though it can be confusing at first, its in between Aljunied and Kallang MRT. So far i havent encountered roaches around, though air con has no control button, sometimes it become too cold, i turned it off. Theres hot and cold water, though its not spacious. Not good if you have kids and large things. Its enough for us since we got 1 suitcase. Well, the receptionist give us nice location, at the rear end. I havent heard any noise. if you try to communicate with the receptionist, i try to simply my english, coz sometimes they wouldnt understand. Theres many food stalls around, if you choose to eat there. At night, you can understand its a red light district. But they dont do harm, its safe in Singapore.","The double mattresses were totally saggy...we even changed rooms & was still the same. Our 1st room had hot shower problems. Both rooms were facing the front street & wifi was only reachable from inside the closet well...the rest of the room was useless! Other room our friends stayed in was good signal though. Daily cleaning was decent. I know its a cheap hotel. its my 2nd time in SG, you can hardly find with its price.

Very good ratio price and quality, the room is clean and every thing is at the proper place. the bathroom is efficient, the paint is ok everything work well. Goodlocation to go any there is the city from the MTR or the bus there is so much passing around. Good fruit area, dim sum open 24 hours indian and chinese restaurants. We booked this place through hostelbookers as budget hotels are unfortunately hard to find in Singapore and most of them are in Geylang: the red light district. This place has rooms by the hour, so you know what to expect. We had a cramped room but with a comfortable bed and free bottled water and air-con (as well as a TV). Small cockroaches in the bathroom, tired furnishings, noisy corridor. The reason it's 3 stars and not less is because we knew what to expect and it was much nicer than the dire Fragrance hotels in the same area. It's fine for travellers on a budget who need one night. But if you're looking for a ""nice"" hotel, look elsewhere (and be prepared to pay more) From the cheap backpacker's perspective, this hotel is great. It's about as cheap as you can get for a private room in Singapore AND it was clean, quiet, and in a good location. The bed was also very comfortable. Not much more to ask for. Yes, the rooms are small, but I've had much smaller (which were also dirtier and smellier too!). The Amrise was close to public transportation and had lots of food choices available nearby, including a small super market. You could pay the same amount for a much lovelier and ritzy place in Thailand or Cambodia, but those are much cheaper countries to travel in. I spend 2 nights in this hotel in February. It's between two train stations which are not far away . Street is very busy with restaurants and shops near by, but you can sleep without any problems. I had single room , really small one but god equipment. You can prepare cafe or tea and bathroom is really clean as all room is. WiFi connection in room is god also. So much cheep restaurants around that you cant be hungry. Staff is correct , so, for that money it's good choice, I recommend it. The room we stayed in was small and muggy. There were insects everywhere and the front desk wasn't very polite to say the least. We ended up staying here because the hotel we wanted was full and plus it was only an over night stay because of our flight. The bed was stiff and hard as well as the pillow. You might as well use a rock to rest your head on. I wouldn't stay here again nor will I recommended for anyone. It's a cheap option and I didn't expect much. Check-in was grand. A really nice and friendly taller gentleman checked us in and we got a room with a window instead of the cheaper windowless room that we had booked. An upgrade! The rooms are tiny. That was fine. But our room had little baby cockroaches. I saw three of them over the course of two nights. Yuk. The manager was the rudest little runt I have ever come across. A nasty piece of work. Avoid this place. This is a ""get what you pay for"" kind of place. Unless you're on a really tight budget, go find somewhere nicer. About 10 minutes walk from Kallang MRT this place is surrounded by popular eating places - and apparently an active red-light area! No lift in the hotel. Staff pleasant and helpful. No computers but wifi available. I had chosen a ""deluxe room"" (ha ha). Mine was on the front of the hotel which is right on a very busy road. When I asked to move back I was told the deluxe rooms are all at the front - noisy and catching all the light from neon signs outside. The rooms are basic with an attached bathroom. Small TV with patchy reception and limited range of channels. Fridge included. Aircon adequate. For one night between flights this is bearable but there's much better on offer in singapore - although nothing decent at this kind of price!! The first day I was given the room on the third floor. The room was good but I but I ask to be transferred to 2nd floor coz I have hard time going up. I was given another room the nest day which is room 217. I as in a hurry and did not check the room before I transfer and to my horror room 217 was filthy the ceiling has like a hole. The airconditioner is not working it was much colder in the reception area.the aircon is also filthy so is the ceiling of the bathroom. So i requested for another room when I get back the hotel but they told me that there is no available room and it was very late already so I have no choice but to sleep in a warm and filthy room. The next day i cmplained and they informed me that ehy are going to check and clean. I went back to the hotel again very late and to my horror its still the same the aircon is working but the air that is coming out is not cold so I have to sleep on a warm room. And in the morning when I wake up I check that still the aircon is dirty also. And there is no fridge Stayed two nights at this hotel. Chose it because of price and location near an MRT and if those weren't true then this place would suck! You stay on Durian St so it always smells, there's an hourly rate advertised at the front desk and the room was literally enough for a bed two bags and not much else (let alone windows). All-in-all nothing was really wrong with the place just decidely average. Unlikely I'd return. Perhaps try getting twin room - less chance someone has spent the previous hour in it haha. I'd recommend for people on a budget but try the YMCA first because the location is better and really the private bathroom isn't worth it. good: close to bus stop and aljunied stn a lot of restos nearby authentic chinese few steps when you go to the right cold and quiet ac free internet, though id did not work for us, but my friend in another room was able to use it, they were beside the stairway bad: hair on our blanket when we arrive room too small, if you have a big luggage, u wont be able to move no cable coffee, toiletries, bottled water must be asked before they bring it to you not hospitable, keeps on hanging up when i was asking for toothpaste no elevator",,,
gnewey,555733,"My room wasn't ready when I arrived, was not ready for awhile more after, but the staff was very apologetic and nice about it. Even offered me another room to rest in. When I finally got into my room, I was so happy with it. It was a big suite, large sleeping area, couch, desk, lounge, kitchen. The bed was a firm spring bed with feather pillows, the shower water was hot and powerful, the windows were big and can be opened wide. Free wifi, coffee, tea. The location was really nice, not for from everything, but far enough for some sanity and quiet. But it gets noisy at night, the Saturday I was there, not unbearable. I was on the front of the building on the second floor. Overall, I would give this hotel an A+. Location is fantastic for museums and sightseeing, but not smacked in the middle of nightlife, which is great for blissful sleep. The hotel is well designed (although the two giant rocking chairs in my room are kind of clumsy), clean, nicely maintained. Another plus, FREE wifi. The staff is SUPER, very friendly, professional and helpful. Downside, go hungry after 11pm, no food in hotel or surrounding (except for the room mini bar snacks), and the room phone, I needed a manual to call the front desk. Overall a very pleasant stay. They pride themselves with their ""WISH"" and ""Whatever, Whenever service""... but only only based on the what they want to do. Apparently asking for someone to come to my room to help me delete spam messages (left by the hotel) on my phone was unreasonable. The Whatever, Whenever agent seem to not want to help me out, after losing my cool on the phone, she came. And reported the incident to security. The next time I had the same request, they sent security banging at my door asking me to do it myself. HE WAS BANGING on my door. What the hell. Room service was always leave something behind. Once the brownie that took an hour, came wthout the icecream, it was brought up half hour later. This time round, they fotgot the cream for my bfast. They brought it, no apology from the phone clerk to the waiter as if it was routine.","My room wasn't ready when I arrived, was not ready for awhile more after, but the staff was very apologetic and nice about it.

I was on the front of the building on the second floor. Overall, I would give this hotel an A+. My husband and I stayed at Ansen Suites for seven nights and couldn't have been happier. We had an enormous room (by European standards) overlooking the Bosphorus. The staff was attentive and sweet, rooms were impeccably clean and the location - oh my the location!! We were moments away from the best restaurants, shopping, bars. The price is also very reasonable. I really couldn't say enough about our experience. I stayed in this hotel recently and was not overly impressed. While the room was quite spacy and well-decorated, it took me a couple of minutes to work out how to turn the lights on (it was evening - no lighting in the corridor - and had to find an invisible card slot to turn on the room lights) and even longer to work out how to turn them all off when I went to sleep. It would have been nice if the staff had helped with this (they were not particularly busy). The mattress was as hard as wood and the pillows made of lumpy synthetic material. I ate breakfast in the hotel, including what was meant to have been a hard-boiled egg, but was actually soft-boiled. I didn't have lunch, but had a light dinner in the hotel that evening. I was suffering with severe gastric problems for almost a week afterwards. I've no evidence that this was the cause of the problem, but it was the only food I ate and I only drank sealed mineral water, so I think it's reasonable for me to query whether there is a causal link (hence the question mark in the title). The Italian restaurant food wasn't great. The final insult was an attempt to extort Ã¢âÂ¬40 for a short journey that actually cost under TL20. The hotel staff refused to hail a cab off the street, but insisted on calling a service. I was not impressed. I don't think I'll be staying again. The location is ideal close to the bars, restaurants and sights. Accessible since it is streets away from the Tunel and the metro. The rooms are extremely comfortable with a relaxed, chilled out style to them. The best part is the size of the rooms, plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy yourself. Everyone at Ansen Suites went out of their way to ensure our stay in the city was enjoyable. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will definitely stay there again when I (hopefully) return to Istanbul. Will endorse positive views of previous reviewers on size of room, location, friendliness of staff and breakfast. I stayed in 101, no stink, but the bathroom is not deluxe. The shower has an impractical head, shoots straight at incredible pressure. It could do with a conventional head. Staff spoke english very well. Our dinner experience at the restaurant below was mixed. It is subjective of course that we found it very expensive: almost 200 Lira/80 Euros for a simple meal for three. The chef speaks excellent english but will not listen :). Will stay here again if I can, but am curious about the other hotels in the area as well that look nice as well. This is a great hotel, with only 11 rooms all different all suites. My friends and I visited Istanbul for my bachelorÃ¢â¬â¢s party and loved the city. The hotels are a small restaurant in which breakfast was served every morning. All rooms also have Wi-Fi, and have a kitchenette as well. This hotel is located 2 minutes walking distance from Istiklal which is filled with bars, restaurants and clubs. There is a great pizzeria and bar around the corner from the hotel. -Location- close to some of the best restaurants and bars, a good area to stay in, and the hotel is on a side street so you're away from the bustle whilst being close to the action. Getting to sultanahmet was a bit of a pain - taxis are cheap but traffic is a big problem in istanbul. we tended to walk, despite the heat. - Rooms - really spacious and comfortable, with large modern bathrooms. Huge bed. Good shower. No bath. hairdryer provided. Kitchen, but no pans or cutlery - not sure how you'd use these. Rooms have no view, and we had some street noise at the weekend. - Internet connection was not great. -Staff/atmosphere. Most of the staff were really nice and friendly, but most did not speak English. Despite being a modern 'boutique' hotel, there was something of the chain hotel about the staff uniforms and badges, and the manager was a little brusque and intimidating, which made us reluctant to eat at the hotel/bistro other than for breakfast. The atmosphere was not relaxing, it was the kind of place where you keep to your room, but I would not fault the rooms themselves or the location of this hotel. We stayed in this very well located hotel for 5 nights in June 2010. Our rooms were huge! and also clean and comfortable. The hotel only has 10 rooms I believe. The rooms facing the front of the hotel are larger but do not have a view. The back facing rooms have a view if you go up a few floors, but are not as large. Attentive service (for the most part). Good breakfast. My only issue: They did neglect to pass on a message (from a Turk, so it wasn't a language issue). There are a lot of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. A great neighborhood to stay in. The Hotel was excellent, staff were friendly, the rooms were spacious and well designed. The location is close to the Galata Tower and is close to excellent restaurants, bars and shopping on Istigal Caddesi. Sultanahmet is a very pleasant walk accross the Galata Bridge. The location provides for excellent access to the main attactions in Istanbul - but is away from the madding crowd. If we go back to Istanbul we will probably stay here again.",,,
Jenny G,231927,"I went to the Lodge of the Ozarks for my first trip to Branson MO, stayed 4 days and 3 nights. I was very impressed by the overall look of the Lodge. The lobby was very open and roomy with beautiful furnishings and comfortable sitting areas. There was a ton of neat and original things to buy from their gift shop. All of the staff their treated me great like I was more then just a customer, they wanted to ensure I was having a good time...very friendly and welcoming! There was so much to do just with in the hotel, from the indoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi, to the Rafters restaurant and the elegant Bar with a running waterfall. At night it was nice to relax out on the patio with the big fountain, I could see all the lights from the local theaters nearby (kinda made me feel as if I was in Vegas :) I stayed on the 2nd floor and absolutely loved everything about my room. The furniture was really nice, new and comfortable. I had a small fridge and kitchen sink, flat screen TV, comfy bed and cannot forget to mention big Jetted bathtub! In the mornings I was treated to a big free breakfast buffet in the restaurant, everything was fresh and hot and yummy. This is a place I will be returning to and recommending to my friends and family when they are looking for a retreat. The only bad thing was that I couldn't have stayed longer. KUDOS to everyone at the Lodge it was more than what I expected!!! Thank you! This family run Hotel is the best solution for people who want a quiet but central accommodation in Rome. It has its own parking spot and a small garden to relax after a hectic day in the city. Also its location is ideal, being at walking distance from Termini (5min). From this station you can reach easily every corner of the city and especially the city centre (10-15 min) with buses and subways. It is also true that from this Hotel you can walk to the Spanish steps in 25-30min. The owners are really friendly and always helpful in suggesting what to see, where to eat and shop in Rome. Our room was comfortable and recently renewed. It was clean, had air condition and free internet. In addition, this Hotel offers a big buffet breakfast, with a lot of choices of bread, egg, ham and cheese among others food type. We booked through internet and we got a fair price for our stay during the Easter week-end. As we were leaving in the evening, the staff was so nice to store our luggage until our departure hour and book us a taxi for the airport. In general, we really enjoyed our permanence in this friendly, comfortable and charming Hotel. Definitively a place to go back the next time we visit Rome!","This family run Hotel is the best solution for people who want a quiet but central accommodation in Rome.

In general, we really enjoyed our permanence in this friendly, comfortable and charming Hotel. Definitively a place to go back the next time we visit Rome! We stayed at the hotel Villa delle Rose end of february this year. The hotel was reccomeded us by a couple of friends as a nice small hotel runs by a family. And this is actually what we got: the hotel was nice and very clean, the room large enough to accomodate all our belongings and moreover it was recently renovated. We asked for a quiet room (Rome can be quite a noisy city!) and they gave us a room facing the hotel small garden and courtyard: it was silent and we slept very well. The breakfast was nice,buffet style and with several choises. The hotel staff was friendly and they give us lot of useful touristic info and well appreciated advices on restourants and food places. Finally, the position was really convenient: walking distance (200 mt) from the Termini station with buses for any directions and underground (it took us only 10/15 minutes to go to piazza di Spagna) and we could also get there by foot. The price we think was fair: not cheap but not expensive either. We would say we had good value for our money. And the wireless was free! After reading the reviews I wanted look for another hotel but most were already booked. The available ones were way beyond our budget. So we stayed in the hotel anyway. When we arrived, the staff at the front desk was very kind efficient despite his age. The hotel itself needs some renovation. We booked a family room for 5 persons and we were given 2 adjoining rooms which was good as we had 2 bathrooms. We found the bathrooms clean, no molds as described by other guests but the ref was moldy, so we did not use it. We did not need it though as it was chilly and nothing needed refrigeration. Our heater in the triple room did not work. We reported it on our first night, but no one was there to fix it. The next morning the it was fixed. But night came, it would not work again. It was chilly (Dec 30 and 31) and we were not able to sleep well. Breakfast selection was good but the staff were not too friendly. The staff at the front desk were very kind. The elderly person even helped us print our boarding pass for free. This gesture made up for whatever was lacking in the hotel.. We arrived this hotel on the evening for one night. The room we got was comfortable. The staff on that night was helpfull The hotel is situated near the central station. At night the area isn't attractive. We came again for another night at the end of our tour. This time we where very disapointed. We got a room at the 4th floor. No windows (only near the ceiling) There was no water pressure and in the morning no hot water. When I complained about it at the reception I got the answer that it can't be since no one else complained about it - so maybe I was imagening that we had no hot water and the cold water was only dripping from the tap. Since we had no windows I tried the aircondition. We didn't feel it either but got the same answer. The point of light in this hotel was the breakfast. The price is reasonable but one have to make sure that the room won't be on the 4th floor. The hotel looks quite lovely from the outside and in the lobby. Helpful staff. Free parking (limited to 4 cars). Within walking distance to Termini train/bus station. When we arrived we were given a room that had no air conditioning. I guess there are about 8 rooms that don't have air conditioning, but the rest of the hotel does. They allowed us to change rooms the next day that did have air conditioning, but you could barely tell since the hotel staff has control over the setting the temperature! The room we switched to was much bigger (could sleep at least 3 comfortably) and it had a bathtub!!! Out of the 10 different places we stayed in Italy, it was the only bathtub we ever saw! It rained one night and we were unable to close one of the windows. The rain poured in and drenched the carpet! Fortunately for us we were leaving that morning. I felt the room was somewhat expensive considering the quality. Late review, but we are really satisfied with what the hotel had offered, unless for the night shift receptionist who's a bit grumpy! :-) The hotel is nice and clean. Bathroom is a bit small. Close to everything. Breakfast is adequate. Maybe a bit costly to anybody who'd carry a currency lower than the Euros. What do you expect? This is Rome, pal! :-) Thanks to Filippo and the breakfast waiter, you've been a wonderful companion throughout our stay in Delle Rose. *In case you're wondering, I'm the Asian guy who always ask for hot water for my baby's milk :-) Read my blog www.sibulat.com for our trip to Rome & Venice, Chiao! We were really happy with our room at this hotel. Our room was spacious and had a gorgeous balcony. The train station is only about 500m away yet the hotel is hidden off the street in a quiet location. We were able to walk to all the major sights within Rome. The included breakfast is buffet style and the breakfast staff are fantastic. Overall we had a great stay here and would recommend it for short/long stays. We joined a friend of ours on a trip to Rome and there was a large group of us. The hotel was perfect for location, value for money, clean, comfortable and a great pied a terre for discovering Rome. We had the opportunity to share romantic moments as a couple and wonderful banquets as a group, would definitely recommend a city break to Rome and this hotel is an ideal 3 star option. We'll be back!",,,
TA14,205873,"OK I read all of the reviews and when I read some I was afraid of what we'd find. The place was wonderful. Not a cockroach in sight. LOL The place was clean, staff was friendly, pools were awesome, food was good, drinks were good, room was ample. Unless you only have two people get at least a 1 or 2 bedroom. We stayed in a studio and could have used more space. The pool area was amazing for kids. My 4 year old son with with us and he LOVED it. We were at the parks and he wanted to go back to the pool. So close to all the parks. Didn't hassle us about timeshare. Even though it is a timeshare type resort, the towels were changed out and new toiletries were put in the bathroom every day. She even took dirty dishes away and put clean ones in the cupboard. We would definitely go back. Also, for the reviews about cockroaches, it's Florida, there are going to be bugs. Don't leave food laying around your room if you don't want to attract visitors. LOL We didn't see a bug and everything was clean. That's all. Enjoy.

I did a lot of reviewing before I selected a hotel. I read reviews, searched locations, etc. I picked this one for it's location and that is all it has. It is in a terrific spot, close to everything. There are little stores to purchase drinks/snacks, restaurants, shops just steps away. Also, close to central transportation. The problems. We had a balcony. No soundproofing at all. The room was gloomy, the bed was HARD, bedspread was dirty, the noise was terrible. Sirens, horns, etc. You may as well bring your bed to the sidewalk. The shower was small but the problem was the wand shower head. There are too many other hotels even in the direct vicinity of this hotel to stay here. Spend more if you have to. It's ROME!","Very pleasant and helpful reception staff. Room clean and comfortable and very warm. Very basic breakfast. Pastries, bread, packet toast, box cereals. Tea and coffee. Our room was next to the breakfast room so we were woken every morning by knocking which we discovered was the old coffee granules being emptied out of the coffee machine for each cup of coffee made, (good coffee) otherwise we slept well.. There was free Internet access, but it did not work in the rooms. We were 4 th floor, so we had to sit in reception for Internet access. Very good location close to many amenities. Hotel Le Petit offers very good value. its close to all amenities, easy and safe walk from the train station. the breakfasts were good, plenty to chose from. second helpings were no problem. reception staff were helpful as to where to go, how to get there.rooms were medium size, quiet and modestly appointed. comfortable beds, and the rooms and building were clean. nice hotel, excellent location, close to metro , services very good... the room was nice not so small how i read This hotel is very well located near tourist sites and the train station and has clean, but small rooms. However, our air conditioning never worked in our room and the hotel staff was indifferent. Also, the breakfast was poor as others have indicated. We went 3 nights in Rome two couples and we stayed at the Hotel Le Petit. Now, the price per night is very high, but in Rome center, all the hotels are very expensive.Is a small hotel distributed between the second and fourth floor of an elegant old building. The areas are well cared for and decorated, but everything very small. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast room is very small, has 16 seats, many people accumulate at 8.30 for breakfast. Breakfast is simple, a continental breakfast with very good expresso and capuccino, toasts, bread with jam and marmelade, some pastries and a few kelloggs. That's all, no ham, no salads, no sandwiches. Girls serving on breakfast room are very gentle and friendly. Rooms are little, so small that you hardly pass between the wall and your bedside, but well mantained and decorated. Bathroom are completely news but the shower is so narrow that yoy hardly go in and out. Anyway, having stayed other times in Rome, I would stay here again. For the situation, is only five minuts walking from Termini Station, Santa Maria Maggiore and close to Piazza Republica. Touristic Busses start their toute on the opposite side of Piazza Republica, so for a touristic trip is a very well situated hotel. Short walking to Quattro Fontane, Fontana dei Tritone and maybe 15 minutes walking from Fontana Di Trevi. Buses number 64 and 40 stops on the corner with Via Nazionale, and they take you to the Vatican, also close to Piazza Navona... Those are two useful bus lines, but are always crowded We loved our stay in this hotel. My husband and I have travelled a lot throughout Europe, and I was thrilled with Le Petit! Staff was fantastic, location was perfect. For this trip I was travelling with my 75-year-old mother, so convenience of transportation was important (and taxis in Rome are much more expensive than in, say, Madrid). The metro is a block away and on the red line, which hits more of the main tourists sites than the blue, and there are easy buses along Via Nazionale (right around the corner) to get to main sites. The staff was incredibly helpful in explaining the transportation and making excellent, non-touristy restaurant recommendations. My mother and I were both so happy with this hotel, that I feel the need to address some of the other reviewers' comments. Rooms were very clean, towels were changed every day (despite my request--in my halting Italian, so it's probably my fault--that neither towels nor sheets be changed every single day, as it seems a waste to me). Maybe it's because I live in the western U.S. where water is an issue, but I've stayed in very nice hotels from Chicago to Madrid that have signs about guests' option not to change towels and sheets every day as an environmental question, so I just don't think it's a big deal. Yes, of course, the rooms (and the shower) aren't very big; it's a European hotel in an older, gorgeous central part of an old European city, so I'm not sure what the other reviewers were expecting. Of course, the hotel was not cheap, but again it's Rome, so it's all relative. There's a lot of walking to do in Rome to start with, so a great location is important and worth a little extra to me. We loved this little hotel, and we will absolutely stay there again next time we are in Rome! We enjoyed our stay, because: it was close to Metro, close to Termini. Close to Tram. It was situated in a ""normal"" area, not very touristy, like Piazza Navona. The staff was friendly. The breakfast ok, its a hotel... but nice cakes, good coffee. The room quiet and clean, and cozy... with a little balcony. I did a lot of reviewing before I selected a hotel.

The shower was small but the problem was the wand shower head. There are too many other hotels even in the direct vicinity of this hotel to stay here. Spend more if you have to. It's ROME! First, the good parts: The location is very central, people at the reception and the cleaning lady were both friendly. Not that they solved my problems, they were just friendly. Also, the central location combined with poor sound isolation means lots of annoying sounds in the middle of the night. Bring your earplugs with you!! And yes, this is still the good part! The negative sides of my experience evolve around the hygiene and service factors, which I believe are central to any hotel. Throughout my one week stay, the room was dusty and alarmed my allergies to a new level. The irritation continued even after I got rid of the blankets and the bed cover, which were really dusty. When I told the management that I wanted to cancel due to this general lack of hygiene, I was rejected with the excuse that a three day notice was necessary. I would expect them to try to solve this inconvenience, instead of making it a bigger issue for me. Moreover, the rail system for the showerhead wasn't stable and the showerhead (almost) fell on my head. And that thing is heavy!! When I asked the management to replace it, they first said I didn't have to use the rail system and could hold the showerhead (thanks for the suggestion). When I insisted, they said they will replace it, which never happened, instead they taped it. I don't call this good service. And how much does that rail system cost anyway? 10-15 euros? Come on.. Final verdict, choose this hotel only if you're looking for a top spot and don't care about anything else. personal was extrem. helpfull. i book my trip through hotwire--big mistake--they book hotel outside of rome, but provide me with rome adress. when i arrived at hotel --was no room reserved. hotel staff was exelent .",,,
fpmurphy,1147724,"Nice clean and decently furnished rooms. Good breakfast. Great overnight reception people. Problematic wireless Internet. Went down in evening and reception was no authorized to reset it. Was told that it would be reset (cycle power) when maintenance person arrived at 8am in the morning - which it was. Also, before I booked this hotel as I was arriving in San Diego, I phoned hotel and was told that airport shuttle ran 24-hours a day. Not so, it is actually 5am to 11pm. A taxi from airport to hotel will cost you approx $15. The hotel is located conveniently off I5. Property and room was clean and maintained. Only problem was continuous noise of traffic from the freeway. If you are going to stay at this hotel make sure that you get a room on the wast side of the hotel - away from the freeway. Internet access is $4.95 for 7 days. Speed was adequate. Only problem was that Hotmail did not work. You could log into Hotmail but not write a new message or view or delete your messages.","We stayed here for a VERY extended stay... and enjoyed our experience even during their recent renovation. All the rooms have gotten fresh paint, new carpet, elegant details, fresh bed-toppers and designer linens. If you were here before the renovation, you will be pleasantly surprised at the interior face lift the rooms and hallways have gotten. It's the best value in Carlsbad Village. I would recommend it to anyone, and I will most likely be staying there again. By the way - they are pet-friendly, and the staff is great. The hotel is located conveniently off I5.

I have stayed in Extended Stay Americas all over this country and this is by far the worst one. The staff was unresponsive to any requests including maid service. Once a week maid service was at best every other week. The place was very poorly maintained and when I said something to the manager she just shrugged it off. When we checked in there were several problems in the room when I brought them to the attention of the manager she said that she was aware of them but hadn't had time to fix them. Defiantly not what I expect from Extended Stay America. I was worried given some of the reviews here, but I have stayed for a month and am enjoying it just fine. DO request a room facing AWAY from the I-5 - that is *very very loud*. Got switched to a different room a week in and have had no problems whatsoever. The staff clean the rooms weekly and do a good job. The people at the front desk are nice. Internet costs $5 for entire stay. Location is very good. Off on a dead-end street, it is a 15 minute walk from the train (Coaster)/bus station, and maybe 20 minute walk from the beach. A nice neighbourhood with little shops, restaurants, and an Albertson's nearby. Nice pool out back. Good value for money - just don't expect the Ritz! This is a perfectly adequate motel-by-the-Interstate that accepts pets for an extra fee. Decent size room, comfortable beds, nice pool, a couple short blocks from the shops and eateries of the village. We had a room overlooking the courtyard, and there was no freeway noise at all. Unfortunately, the courtyard had a party that went on pretty late; that was moderately disturbing. About 11:00, we started hearing 1 or more dogs (turned out to be 2) barking vigorously, and it went on for an hour or more. We finally traced it to the room next door. We reported it to the desk, but in the meantime the tenants next door came home and apologized, and from then on it was quiet. In the morning the desk staff was very apologetic and took $50 off the bill. I guess we'd stay there again, but we would definitely make sure we got a room far from any pets. My wife and I visited the Extended Stay America located in Carlsbad, California on May 1-2, 2010. The exterior grounds and building are well kept and attractive. The interior offers lots a nice amenities. It was nice to have a mini kitchen located in the same room. What a nice convenience. The location is just a short walking distance to the downtown Carlsbad area which is very beautiful. The service at the hotel was very good. We noticed that the downstairs was refurbished and looks great. The 2nd floor is in need of reburbishing which will most likely be completed in the near future. We would recommend this locations to business travelers and families. It really is an excellent value. We will certainly book reservations again.",,,
c g,2515378,"Ok. We are very modest folks but we do prefer to sleep in a clean and comfortable room especially for $112.00. We don't need frills. At all.

Excellent location. Rooms dark and dreary. Buffet breakfast which was comprehensive and delicious. You could order hot items but there was a huge array of fresh fruit, meats cheeses, breads and cakes. Overall we were pleased with our choice.","After reading Hotel On the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, I wanted to stay at the Panama Hotel when we went to Seattle. We absolutely loved it! I was unsure after reading some of the reviews but have traveled extensively all over the world so was game to try this one. The room was clean and the beds were wonderful...soft and fluffy. The bath was across the hall but I've stayed in places in Europe, such as the canal houses in Amsterdam, that also had shared baths. The bath was clean. The staff was cordial and talked at length about the hotel, answering our many questions. We had tea and the delicious squash bread in the tea room next to the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed reading the journal entries written by other travelers who read the book. Of course, we added our own entry. There was a wealth of history in the photos and items in the tea room and it was great to browse and look at it all. One morning we had breakfast listening to a pianist, a woman who came in off the street to use the piano. She played beautifully and it was wonderful to sit and listen to her while we had tea. We were disappointed we did not get to see the baths in the basement as the owner was away. We definitely will stay there again and are hoping the owner will be present so we can get to the basement on the next visit. Ok.

The owner is really friendly, and seems to have dedicated her life to preserving this landmark hotel and the stories that come with it. The rooms are very well kept and are meant to be as similar to the original rooms as possible. I stayed here because I had read ""Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet"" and wanted to feel closer to the story. It worked! The good part is that the Panama Hotel is in an interesting part of Seattle, surrounded by a lot of Asian restaurants and grocery stores. The bad news is that it's run by a really terrible woman. I don't want my bad service rating to reflect on the staff, they were not great, but okay. But the owner seemed like she was always there, yelling at people, harassing other tenants, and just generally making my stay as uncomfortable as I can imagine. The hotel bathrooms were not all operational. The room was not cleaned or beds made until requested. The owner was angry, rude and totally unresponsive to requests. The coffee shop and lobby were not opened as advertised. It was a nightmare place to stay! I stay in lots of unique, antique, penssione-type rustic places all over the world, and while this hotel is attempting to be quaint and historic it is clearly straddling the line between hotel and flop house. Some travelers have written positive reviews: maybe they weren't paying attention to the details, like the rat traps under the beds, the overwhelming smell of cat urine and actual roaming cats in the hallways, and flop house clientele who book rooms by the month. Honestly if you are a solo traveller or young adventurer you might be able to handle this--but if you have asthma, are squeamish about rats, and are uncomfortable with drunks and prostitutes going in and out, don't stay here. I went in, saw the room, saw the cats and sleazy neighbors and only stayed for a few hours before leaving. Impossible to spend the night here. I called from our Cruise Ship Guide to book a couple nights upon our return from our cruise to Alaska. My first hint that this could be a problem was as the taxi driver asked where I got the name of this hotel, that it normally dosen't cater to the ""cruise ship types"". Then he proceeded to tell me, as gently as possible since my young son was traveling with me, that there had been a massacre in the area ( in the basement possibly) of this hotel!!!! We arrived and there was the steep staircaise looming ahead with a ""check in desk"" the size of a letter holder sitting at the top. So we lugged our luggage up to the top and were shown to our ""room"". They had said it was historic but so were the beds. My son sat down and the springs sank nearly to the ground and the bed leaned sideways. Then I went to lock the door and the lock fell out, so I went back to tell the ""check in person"" that this was just not going to work at all. He then called the owner and showed us to a room with a bed that I thought could work for 2 days. That night the ""woman"" in the room above seemed to be doing alot of repititious ""entertaining"" on one of those spring mattresses that actually was hitting the floor above our heads all night. And the room next to us left a light on all night long that shined right into our window and assisted the woman above in keeping me up all night. I had a pillow over my sons ears!!!! I checked out FIRST THING in the morning and stayed at a hotel far outside of town since there weren't any available high time in town. Such an unbelievably awful stay that I may never go back to Seattle because of it!!!!! The worst time I have ever had and I have traveled to 4 continents with my son. The Panama Hotel was definitely an excellent experience for me. I traveled with my mother, and we are always looking for different, unique places to stay. If you want the usual very prim and neat hotel, this is not the place for you. If you enjoy heritage and history and are willing to sacrifice a few things for the time you are staying in Seattle, book a room here! In the rooms, there is antique furniture and just a sink. If you need a washroom, there is a full washroom just down the hall from your room. I never encountered anyone while using the washroom, so there was no need to rush. There was a claw-foot tub, which I loved. There are no elevators there, with it being a heritage building. However, the hotel is only 3 levels high, so it shouldn't be a problem as long as you are mobile and able to climb a few flights of stair. The staff are very friendly, and I have maintained a friendship with the owner, Jan. I never experienced any paranormal activity while I stayed there, but I wish I had! besides the occasional creak in the floor from someone walking to the washroom, it was very quiet. One of the best things about this hotel is the cafe downstairs. They have jars and jars of loose-leaf tea, and their baked good are to die for. If they have sweet cheese croissants, buy as many as you can! There are historic photos for you to look at while you wait, and a pane of glass on the floor to look into the basement to see articles of clothing and furniture they found when they converted it to a hotel. Across the street is Kobe Park, which I highly recommend you check out. It seems very tiny, but if you follow the different paths, each one leads to a public garden. All in all, a very, VERY amazing place to stay!",,,
lovebug123,2515570,"We recently stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving. I can tell you traveling with two young children, this hotel worked out well for us. I love the kid's suites. Very convenient. However, the ""suites"" are somewhat small. The fact that you have to walk through the kid's room to use the bathroom was a pain too. We had to tip-toe in the middle of the night. The room was a bit stinky at first. But.... once I asked the maid to please change all the linens and deodorize the room, she did, and it was much better. The breakfast was better than expected compared to other hotels we have stayed in. It gets crowded early so we were there by 7:30 to beat the crowds. Our keycard did not work for our room several times so we had to travel to the front desk a lot, but they seemed to make the effort to fix the problem. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the price. If you want to go to sleep early, try not to get a room by the pool. It is open until 10pm and there was always kids in the pool, even though it was like 40 degrees! Yikes! The hot tub looked nice and the hotel seems to be well-maintained. It is only a ten minute drive to Sea World so the location was perfect for us! Even though it is right off the freeway, you don't really hear the noise. Good hotel for kids and bigger families but would not recommend for couples or singles who need rest. We recently stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving.

After being in the travel business for a long time, I have had the opportunity to stay in MANY hotels. Everything from the Ritz to Motel 6. I know what people look for in a hotel. My family and I were looking for clearn, affordable and safe while we visited my dad in South San Diego. We knew we would not spend time at the hotel, so we decided to not spend too much money but wanted something clean and decent. This hotel had good customer service. The lady at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was decent. That is about the extent of the positive. Now for the real problems: Our kitchenette sink was clogged when we arrived. The room smelled bad. The furniture and carpet was dingy. The manager who came into my room to unclog the sink, left a 12 inch knife ( very sharp) right on the bathroom sink area that my two year old found and handed to me!!!! This was that straw that broke the camels back and mine! I was shocked. His reaction? ""oh. I forgot the knife"" oooops! Then, I called down for a roll a way bed since the couch was so smelly and dirty for my three year old and he said, ""sure no problem"". I only found out later that he would charge me for this without informing me of the price or the fact that there was a charge in the first place. His explanation? "" this is not a cheap motel maam"" Only cheap hotels don't charge for roll a way beds. What? made no sense to me at all. When I saw the knife, I should have just grabbed my family and ran for the hills. The location stinks too! You are surrounded by industrial toxins and huge trucks in line to cross the border. It is way out of the way from anything remotely interesting....( except for Mexico) if you you happen to have your passport with you. The only reason I gave this hotel any credit at all was their nice front desk lady and the comfy bed in the room. Other than that, this hotel is AWFUL!!!

The only reason I gave this hotel any credit at all was their nice front desk lady and the comfy bed in the room. Other than that, this hotel is AWFUL!!! We stayed here because we were attending a show at the Cricket Wireless Amphitheater; none of my party drive and we needed a hotel close by. The room was large and clean but smelt old, like it hadn't been aired for years. The beds were very comfy though, and the smell definitely wasn't a reflection on the cleaniness of the room itself. The staff were really friendly, although the woman on the front desk gave us some embarrassing advice regarding a nearby restaurant: she told us it was too far to walk with our luggage (four 'long' blocks) and called us a cab; turns out it was literally around the corner and resulted in a very annoyed cab driver (who'd taken the job after his colleague didn't bother showing up at all) and us over-tipping in embarrassment. The only other complaint we had was that the walls in our room were extremely thin. We could hear people snoring in the next suite along! But overall it was great value for the price (approx. $95) and perfect for attending the concert (about 10 miles in a cab). OK the other reviews say it all. This is not near downtown San Diego. If you want to walk there it is not going to happen (hence my 4 star and not 5 for location). That said I did not need to get there and had some business in the south east area of San Diego. This is the most friendly Comfort Suites I have stayed at. The gentleman checking me in was very friendly. Very talkative though checking me in and really seemed to care that everything was OK with my stay. He even gave me two bottles of water. I had never been to Tijuana and since it was just 4PM and I have nothing to do that night I asked him for directions and advice. He had lived there and gave me some great places to eat and directions on where to park and walk across the border. Fantastic first impression. When I got back the bed was very comfortable. Great pillow top in this hotel. I hate lousy hotel beds and when spending under $100 for a hotel/motel you dont expect the best but this was the best bed I had been on in a hotel (and I spend 30 nights per year on average in them) The rooms had a fridge and were spotless. I know where I am staying next time I am in town. Next morning I enjoyed their breakfast and found my renal car had battery problems. There were 3 people working there in the morning and after calling Budget (and getting a 2 hour quote on time) I asked the front desk if he could help. He did have cables at the front desk and had me on my way in under 3 minutes. It is easy to find faults when you travel and at times I do. I wrote this because when a property vastly exceeds your expectations they deserve praise. I wish I remembered the name of who checked me in but this guy should train every hotel worker. I was amazed at how friendly all the staff was, how clean my room was. It was nice and large with a great bed. What more could one ask for about $70 in San Diego. I am coming back for sure. THANK YOU COMFORT SUITES OTAY MESA FANTASTIC STAY. My family stayed here for a couple of days last weekend. They have excellent hot breakfast every day with a lot of choice, clean room with extra space, good service and nice staff. The location is right on the border and kind of away from downtown. IHOP, Subway and McDonald are near by. Hotel was $60 for the night as we were going to Mexico the next day. Hotel is right next to the border. Rooms were very big and clean. Great staff. The location is kind of lousy because there is not much around in terms of restaurants or things to do. Not really the hotel's fault, but something to keep in mind. Great place for the price to spend the night if you were going to Mexico for a day.",,,
sammy_ali_10,531031,"We arrived at Conte House after 9pm and were greeted by a smiling Fabio and his friend. He was great- he showed us the sights to see on a map and what we could do each day- we followed his guidance and managed to see everything we wanted and spare time to see extra things. It was really useful and really made are stay. The hotel itself is basic but has all the facilities tv, hairdryer, towels. Breakfast was basic but good- toast, cheese, tomato, croissants etc. The location was just great for the price. One tube stop and you're at Termini and only a few stops to Spanish Steps & Trevi Fountain. Even the Vatican the other side of the city was easy to get to. The best bit the colosseum is 5 minutes walk away. All in all I would recommend Conte House to anyone staying in Rome, the service and location were just perfect! Hotel Nadia is a brilliant hotel, the location is excellent- 2 mins from Dam Square & 1 min from Anne Frank House, then just a short tram ride away from museumplein. The room was quite small but perfectly adequate- fridge, tea/coffee, hairdryer, safe, power shower in bathroom which was unexpected in a budget hotel! Breakfast was good, not a huge amount of choice but enough to keep you going till lunch. The service was 4* drink on arrival, visitor information & map provided, fresh flowers in room, help with luggage (up the very steep stairs!) and the staff were all really friendly & helpful. The only thing to fault about the hotel is the room was pretty noisy. Our room was on the first floor right by the tram route but that really was the only complaint. If I return to Amsterdam would definitely stay at the Nadia Hotel again, I would probably pay the upgrade to a canal view room though.","We arrived at Conte House after 9pm and were greeted by a smiling Fabio and his friend.

We stayed at the Conte House for four nights, and we couldn't have picked a better location and hotel for the price! The owner, Fabio, welcomed us and immediately gave us tipps of what we should definitely do and what we could pass out on based on our likes and dislikes. He also told us where we could get good food for little money, which was great. He is very helpful and always has an answer for you. The room was good, big enough and if you close the windows properly there is no noise from the street. The bath was small but had everything you need, Breakfast was fine, and we never had to leave the hostel hungry. The colosseum is only about 10 minutes by foot, and other main attractions are also within walking distance. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and we will definitely come back to this place! I was staying there for 3 nights. The rooms are clean, the towels are there for free, even shampoo and soap. Breakfast is very nice, I wasn't hungry right after eating like usually in low priced hostels. The location is very good, I even walked to Termini with my luggage. Close to the Colosseum and the metro stations. Great value for money!",,,
jenny a,237570,"THIS PLACE IS SCARY. DO NOT STAY HERE. Left in the middle of the night because we were so afraid. Someone broken into the room while we were gone. The front desk did not do anything about it and tried to charge us $150.00 for it because of the damage the person left. Stayed here a while back. Although we booked an ensuite the tiolet was across the corridor, we did have a small hand sink in what was a cramped room. maybe we got the last room, breakfast was average as was almost everything else, what more can i say, just average. Although I must give credit to its location & a good humoured receptionist. THIS PLACE IS SCARY. DO NOT STAY HERE. Left in the middle of the night because we were so afraid.

We spent 5 nights in a small but very comfortable room with shower overlooking the canal. We are a couple in our late 50's and can highly recommend this little hotel. Stayed here a while back. Although we booked an ensuite the tiolet was across the corridor, we did have a small hand sink in what was a cramped room. maybe we got the last room, breakfast was average as was almost everything else, what more can i say, just average. Although I must give credit to its location & a good humoured receptionist. This hotel has obviously been modernised since some of the reviews were posted - all rooms have en suite shower and toilet, which, if smallish, are bang up to date. Our room was not huge but perfectly adequate - you spend more time outside than in in Amsterdam ! Very clean, comfortable beds, nice view over the Herengracht, not noisy. The reception was friendly, if not smiling, but really helpful when it came to dealing with our car, for example. The breakfast was simple but, again perfectly adequate. So all in all, nothing negative here, with the big pluses of its location, very near the centre, and the price, more than reasonable. Highly recommended. We just got back from Amsterdam and we stayed in a very lovely hotel, right on one of the most beautiful canals (Herengracht) in one of the most charming cities of Europe! The hotel has been freshly renovated - we were the first ones to stay in the room. At first we were concerned about the paint smell but the friendly Brazilian at the desk counter told us that the hotel had been very careful in picking paint that is not toxic. He promised we wouldn't wake up with a headache! Indeed we didn't! Actually, we had a great night's sleep, the beds were comfortable (twin beds), the room was silent (window facing the canal) and the sheets were super clean! The shower/bathroom are in the room and despite the small size, it has the newest technology ( you can regulate the water temperature!). We didn't have breakfast because it wasn't included in our rate. You can pay extra for breakfast but honestly there are so many nice cafes on the canals, that you might as well walk 5 minutes and enjoy a quiet breakfast on a picturesque bridge. I strongly recommend this hotel, a hidden treasure in downtown amsterdam. And for those who complain that the staircases are narrow and steep, don't bother going to Amsterdam then!! Staircases are steep in every house, hotel or shop and it's part of this city's personality. One last technical remark: the hotel rooms have nice wooden floors (no carpet) Great location, clean hotel, satisfactory breakfast. I thought we'd booked a double room, but it was two single beds pushed together. I'd recommend it as it was a good value for the location. A small friendly hotel at the nice Herengracht. Close to everything. Our room was a basic double. Small and simple decorated but very clean and with good beds. No toilett and shower in the room. Shared toilett with 2 other rooms and it was clean, shower shared with one room and it ws small with very little space for clothes, towels but it works. The breakfast was ok with warm bread, fresh coffee, eggs, cerials, youghurt and fruits.",,,

Breakfast included was below average, butbtehvalue overall was very good. Stayed for a couple days during last week of December. Good rate for the area, well furnished and comfortable room. Reserved an ""executive"" room on an upper floor. On check-in the clerk said he was upgrading me to an executive room, as if I had already not reserved it. Oh well, if he wanted extra credit for being good to me, no harm - no foul. The kicker was that both nights, the upper executive floor was occupied by a couple of families with noisy, misbehaving young children allowed to hang out in the hallway. I would expect that an advertised ""executive"" floor would not be where they put young families, especially when the hotel had a high vacancy rate during these days. My other issue was the very loud traffic noise from the adjacent freeway all night long. If I owned this hotel, I would be putting in better noise-abatement windows.

No need to pay for overpriced hotel rooms elsewhere. I stayed here while a family member was having surgery at the nearby Kaiser Permanente hospital and it was very convenient. The hotel offers a discounted rate for family of Kaiser patients and also has a shuttle to and from the hospital, if needed. The walk is 15-20 minutes. The room was quiet, comfortable and genuinely smoke free. There is a Trader Joe's next door. The staff were courteous and helpful. Good location for business in this area, easy to find and close to the freeway. The last fact implies that there may be some noise. There is a good selection of businesses around. My room was fine although there were not much leftover space with two beds in the room. There was no worktable in the room. It had a fridge but you have to fill it up yourselves. All in all it offer good value for the money. This was my second stay at this hotel. I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions. I like that there are many dining options very close to the hotel and having Trader Joe's across the street is nice as well. My disappointment stems from trying the fitness room on this visit. What I found were two treadmills--one out of order and one that kept jumping from 4mph to 6mph--a stair climber and a bicycle. The bicycle didn't have any power so it couldn't be set up to run a program. It looked old. Given the neighborhood I would think the facilities would be much more modern. Other than that my stay has been nice so far. The front desk people were quick and I was checked into my room in no time. The room itself was clean and well prepared--I even had two free bottles of water. We arrived late and tired from sitting in traffic. The staff was completely on point. They could spot the tired mom with three kids coming. They got us in the door and to our room quickly. The room was comfortable and quiet. The cafe staff in the morning was dialed in to my children's little idiocincracies with breakfast choices, and they both had a terrific sense of humor. The food was terrific and they went over the top making sure we were prepared for our day. I'd absolutely recommend it. I stayed at this HI on business for one night during the week. It was very busy and the parking lot was full. I was done with my meetings a little early and was able to get a nice king room at 1pm. The front desk staff was average, but when I needed to find the business center, a gentlemen from the front desk walked me to it since it was kind of by the lounge. The room itself was large, and very clean. It looks like the room was recently renovated with nice blue curtains and linens. The bathroom was nice also and was clean. I did not hear anyone else in the hotel during my stay. Also decent areas to eat around the hotel. We normally stay at the Country Inn in Calabasas, but decided to try HI on Ventura. Wrong decision really. When we checked in, I dont think the guy on the desk even bothered to speak to us, other than to tell us the room number. Totally disinterested in his role. Ordinary all round, though HI always have really comfy beds, but the pillows only get 3 stars at this hotel. It was quite noisy too, and I was aware that it's situated right alongside the 101, but you could hear the continuious hum from the freeway. We got caught up with spring break too and had a very disruptive Saturday night with a group of kids arriving on our floor around 11.30pm with a lot of door slamming and yelling and general boistriousness until I poked my head out the door and told them to be quiet. They all headed out only to return at 4am - more door slamming and yelling. A call to the front desk sent secruity up to sort them out, but the comment from the front desk in the morning was that they have no control over those sorts of situations. I was speachless - they run the hotel for goodness sake, they can decide who stays and who gets chucked out if they're not behaving themselves! Oh, and housekeeping liked to knock on the door around 8am in the mornings - a little early for guests who are staying more than one night, surely there are check out rooms that can be done at this time of the morning. Needless to say, it;'s back to Country Inn & Suites in Calabasas for us.",,,
Debby C,529837,"I feel so itchy of my body for the first night of stay in this hotel. But the later two nights were fine. Properly there is bed bugs in mattress. The hotel looks like its over 10 years old. Staffs are nice. But I think its overpriced. We recently spent five nights in Rome at this Courtyard, and I highly recommend it. It is not close to the central Rome action, but they have a bus that drops you off right by the Vatican, and a two-block walk to the Metro. It is also a 10 minute walk to a train station, which is convenient for going to the Forum, etc. The hotel food was excellent, it was immaculate, comfortable and the staff worked very hard to help us and make our stay a good one. We had a room that faced the city, and our terrace gave us a wonderful view of the St Peter's Basilica Dome. It was magic at night...","The real gem of this hotel is the elderly couple who own it. Very charismatic, very helpful (even though they do not speak English, they at least try!). Breakfast every morning consisted of salami, ham, cheese, breads, orange juice and coffee. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. Very close walk to the subway station (5 minutes) and the Colosseum (15 minutes). Neighborhood a little sketchy looking, but no problems. Great gelato place right around the corner, too! I feel so itchy of my body for the first night of stay in this hotel. But the later two nights were fine. Properly there is bed bugs in mattress. The hotel looks like its over 10 years old. Staffs are nice. But I think its overpriced. Now that Rome was paralysed for 3 days due to extreme weather conditions, (snow,) we really apriciated that there are beautiful attractions and working metro stations in walking distance. I can only repeat that the rooms are small but clean, and the owners are very-very helpful. This is a perfect hotel for visiting this city! Also very good for practicing my italian, because the owner, like the majority of the italians, speaks only very basic english. (Try with french, if you can.) My partner and I stayed here for 2 weeks and had a great time. As other reviews have said, this is a basic hotel (small rooms, basic furnishing, no elevator) but the bed was comfortable, the room clean and the owners very friendly. Unlike some other small hotels like this, the owners don't try to skimp on the small things (good quality toilet paper, 2 bath sheets each, as much food at breakfast as you want and so on). Breakfast was very generous by Italian standards as it included cheese, salami and ham. There was Hero jam, Nutella and generous amounts of butter and most days we could help ourselves from a bowl of fresh fruit. I didn't find the neighbourhood at all unsavoury. Via Bixio is a quiet street with little traffic though pedestrian traffic (with talking) starts early. It's about a 15 walk to the Coliseum and only 2 blocks from the Metro, so the location is good. If you stay here, 2 things to know. One is that if you arrive at Termini Station (the airport train arrives here), take the Giovanni Giolitti exit which is right where the airport train arrives and you'll save yourself a lot of walking. And the 810 bus from right outside the Manzoni Metro station (2 blocks) takes you right to the centre of things past the Coloseum and Forum to Piazza Venezia. The location is good since it is close to some of the major attractions and public transport is easily accessible. The room was small but clean. The bathrooms are tiny and a bit run down. For Italian standards the breakfast was OK. The owners are friendly and helpful. But beware that they do not speak English, so conversations can be a bit difficult. A warm welcome awaits you at this hotel which is run by a lovely family. We stayed one night having been through a bad experience in another hotel up the road (ConteVerde) Rooms clean, en-suite, towels provided, free wi-fi and a superb breakfast. Using google translate helps to communicate if Italian isn't your first language! I stayed at this hotel during the easter break in 2011 and I thoroughly recommend it. The rooms were clean (if basic) and the couple who own it and run it were very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was also very good. I would strongly recomend this Hotel and I have to my friends and they have loved it like I do. The family that runs the hotel are wonderful, warm people. They make you feel at home and are always there to help out. The location is nice, close to many sights and in the authentic part of Roma. There is a wonderful coffee shop right next door to the hotel with a beautiful patio. It is very close to the most famous Gilato, Ice Cream, shops in Roma, Fassi!! There are many wonderful and authentic places to eat near by. One of them is Cavallino Bianco, delicious!! If you are looking for a special little hotel to stay when in Rome I choose the Hotel Lussemburgo every time. The big part of its unique charm lies in the fact that it is a family run Hotel. Run by owners; Carlo, Lucia, their son Massimiliano, and daughter Margareta. They are very professional and work hard to make sure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Other hotels may offer better locations and more amenities, but the service and warmth of the staff creates an atmosphere that will leave you feeling at the end of your stay as if you are a member of the family. For example: When my friend became ill, Lucia brought her some juice and bread to her room which helped her a great deal. Its very difficult to get personal attention like that in bigger hotels. Along with a great staff the hotels location is within walking distance to the train station, shopping areas, tourist sites, and many wonderful restaurants that feature typical Roman cuisine. I have been to Rome many times and I will not even consider another hotel. Hotel Lussemburgo really is a hidden gem. We liked the hotel very much because the location is a walking distance to Santa Maggiore and centre (10-15 min), econimical price, good for value, rooms small but neat and tidy with private shower facilities, TV inside the room, most amicable staff and very helpful. Excellent breakfasts. My friend and I would definately recommend it for tourists. We felt like home here and are going to choose this hotel during our next visit. Elena and Natalie from Riga Don't stay here. Please. Just don't. Even if you think you've searched for another cheap, central option in Rome and come up with nothing, I urge you to look again because I can guarantee you that this is the most miserable, disappointing hotel you'll ever have had the misfortune to shell out for. Just a few of the pleasures you can look forward to are a breakfast of stale 'croissants' and radioactive looking 'fruit juice', and the luxury of being woken up nice and early by the elderly owner literally shouting greetings to her guests in lively Italian. Welcome to your relaxing stay in Rome. The only good thing I have to say about it was that the rooms were clean and the owner's son? grandson? was helpful. The main issue I have is that, for 90 euro a night, I expected at least hot water and the double bed that we had booked. We got neither. At the very least I wouldn't have anticipated the raging rant that we were subject to from the owner when we complained at the lack of hot water and suggested a reduction in our rate. Apparently we were the first people to complain since 1976. The more fools the rest of you, is all I can say. The location was very ideal for me since it was close to some of the major attractions and easily accessible. The service at the hotel was good, room was clean and the owners were friendly and helpful. The fact that they did not speak much English prevented much discussion but they went out of their way to make my stay comfortable. Breakfast was sparse and I couldn't access the wifi connection but there are a number of internet cafes and places to eat close to the hotel that one can use. The hotel is good value for the amount they charge so don't expect any luxury or trimmings. This is just basic accommodation and it suited me fine as I spent my time sight seeing and not sleeping in the hotel.",,,
Kathy A,233932,"My first impression was that this was a funky place... but it grows on you. We were here for a convention in the area. It is centrally located and has great access to public transportation. But you may not need it if you use the courtesy Accura for rides. The room is comfortable and the spa products were refreshed each day. The pool and sand beach combination is certainly not typical for an urban hotel stay. BUT it was the personal attention of the staff that blew me away. They were knowledgeable about the area and what to do and how to get there. Ashley S. at the front desk was esp. helpful when we had friends that left items behind and we required extra attention because we were waiting for a package that wasn't delivered on time. She tracked the item and made us comfortable while we waited. Starwood should be pleased to have her on board. All the staff were pleasant but she went above expectations. We'll definitely stay here again. We stayed at the Desert Rose in mid October and really enjoyed it. We had spent the 11 days prior camping so felt really spoiled when we arrived. The front desk people were very pleasant and called the room to make sure everything was OK just a few minutes after we got to it. Loved the fact that we didn't have to walk through a casino to get to our room/check in. Enjoyed the managers reception on the week nights (especially the free beer). Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and coffee. Found that if we walked up to the strip on Reno Ave. rather than Tropicana Ave. the walk was more pleasant - very short walk to all the action. I also think the bar be ques by the pool are a nice touch. I will be returning in December for the Rock and Roll marathon and can't wait to stay again! The hotel is convenient, clean and a huge bargain! The shuttle service is convenient and prompt. The staff is great and the restaurants are good. My partner and I travel a bit and I read the reviews about this property being as it was the closest one to the U of Phoenix Stadium....We checked in on a saturday and because of the soccer game it was pretty busy, but the girl at the front desk in the evening handled it VERY WELL. She was polite recognized and greeted everyone who came in promptly and she had a very welcoming smile.. Rooms were very clean, property well kept, and staff was amazing. Next time we are phoenix this will be our first choice. Breakfast was out of this world for a ""Continental Breakfast"". Also they have some delicious Orange infused water. and complimentary cookies were great. The only issue I had was with kids running up and down the hall....But I was able to get past that.

We'll definitely stay here again. We stayed at Tre Archi for 2 nights in late Feb. We had read that Venice hotels are usually dark and dank so didn't expect much. We had a room on the second floor (yes, you do have to climb several flights of stairs) and walked into a beautiful light airy room with more space than either the Rome or Florence hotels in which we had stayed. Our room looked out onto the canal and we had fun watching the traffic early in the morning. If you wanted to look disparagingly at the room, yes, the walls were dingy but they were cloth - not wallpaper - and the furnishings were an 18th century style with beautiful old Murano style chandeliers. We thought it all very charming. The bathroom had hot water and great water pressure and the 6'8"" person was able to shower without being cramped. It was a quiet neighborhood and the walk to the vaporetti and Grand Canal was only 5 minutes. Breakfast had all the coffee we wanted and a great Italian sweet bread (as well as other rolls and cereal). It doesn't seem that Italian continental breakfasts are anything but coffee and bread from our experiences. If you want more, go buy something else at the markets nearby. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Our flight from Marco Polo was at 6:30 am so we hired a private water taxi to take us there. From the hotel to the airport was less than 15 minutes. Expensive but worth it at that time of day. We will be happy to stay at Tre Archi in the future.

Expensive but worth it at that time of day. We will be happy to stay at Tre Archi in the future. We went for a few days in January when it was really cold but so atmospheric! Also there were no queues even at the most popular tourist venues. The hourly boat service from the airport is more expensive than the bus but drops you at the next stop after the hotel, Guglie. If you get the vaporetto at the stop outside you need to change to get to the Piazza San Marco area. The routes are a bit variable in the winter. The hotel was OK. The rooms weren't big but were warm and comfortable. There was no lift and no help with our suitcase though we are in our 60's. It was 56 stairs up to our floor. There was help for the young women, however! The breakfast was good, plentiful buffet style and never crowded. We liked the area. It wasn't too touristy.There was a good local shop just round the corner. Also there was an excellent shopping street with a market that went on till about 8 pm. This was not far and on the way towards the centre so we went there often. There was even a shop where all jumpers and tops were E10, coats E20! If you fly into the Marco Polo Venice airport, take a bus into Venice -- it is very cheap and much faster than taking a vaporetto. Then you can take a vaporetto to this hotel, take the one that lists the Tre Archi stop -- the hotel is right there when you get off the vaporetto. I would suggest getting a 24 hr vaporetto pass. Upon walking in, you will notice that it is an older hotel (like most in Venice) and that you will be required to pay a VAT (city tax or value added tax) for each night you stay there. The room we stayed in was on the first floor, which mean it is actually on the second floor... We had a nice few from the back of the hotel and it was very quiet. It was mentioned before that the breakfast was lacking any type of meat(s), but this is typical for Italy, bread with some cheese or butter spread is the norm. Here are a couple of recommendations when traveling to this hotel: 1) Bring your own bar of soap as the soap provided is a packet of liquid. 2) Bring your own shampoo and/or conditioner, what the hotel provides is not enough. 3) Understand that this is an older hotel and it may or may not have a bath tub -- our room did, but it didn't have a shower curtain, but a clear and moveable pane of plastic that really didn't keep the water in the tub. 4) Bring water back with you at the end of the day as I didn't see or find a vending machine to purchase water. 5) There is wifi access in the lobby only and it is quite expensive, I would walk down a bit and goto MQ10 -- it is a cafe with free wifi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap, affordable hotel. It was easy to get to, the staff was friendly and it was relatively close to everything -- remember, you can walk just about anywhere on Venice in 30 minutes or less. Lastly, I stayed there November 29th - 30th and the weather in Venice was very comfortable (cool at night) and it was not crowded at all... Hotel is old, but having somegreat advantages, -chhose the room between 1st and 2nd floor, not remembering the room no but this room having a big beautiful bathroom, two small bedroom as privacy with young children and best part is facing the river --water taxi stand is just opposite the hotel,so easy access --venice market is on your foot from here & can be started from this hotel Stayed 16th October for two nights, and was worried after reading the other reviews. But it was fine, canal view room with beautiful sunlight streaming into it, good size room, clean and bright. The bathroom might have been small and compact, but clean too, also plenty of hot water, and a hot towel rail on 24/7. The breakfasts were a little on the light side, nothing much to eat, only cereal that wasnt particularly nice. But fresh croissants and rolls, and as much tea / coffee as you could drink. There was an older gent on the desk, who was very nice, gave us directions and took our photo for us. The hotel is near to the Ferrovia boat terminal which was only about 10 mins away, and this brought you to San marco and Peggy Guiggenhem Museum also the Rialto bridge. There were lovely places to eat over the bridge, and lots of shopping if you turn left before the bridge. All in all we had a ball, and would recommend the hotel, cheap and cheerful. Terrible customer service (didn't bring up our bags when they said they would, didn't say hello or goodbye when we were checking out), no elevator, breakfast hours were too early and short, mosquitoes/flies in the room that I think were coming from a drain in the bathroom, dirty wall paper, dirty duvet, instead of getting two twins we got one king size bed and location (15 minute walk to train station) was not that convenient since it was quite far from most of the popular sites. The room and bathroom was really tiny, even by European standards. In fact, we went on to a cruise, and our stateroom on the ship was bigger than this room. Our room was up several flights of stairs, and there is no elevator. The breakfast room was cute, but the breakfast offerings were really minimal-like coffee and rolls - period. One of the desk clerks was pretty unfriendly, although another was fine. We've stayed in Venice at least half a dozen times, and in similarly priced hotels; this was the worst. The breakfast that was offered was rubbish. Ther was no eggs no toast no saussages no cereal. just awful! Good for prisoners. This hotel was so easy to find and that is a huge plus for Venice been such a maze. We caught a boat from the train station and 3 stops later the hotel was directly in front of our stop. Perfect. The hotel itself is nice. Our room was gorgeous, split level with old fashioned furniture and very Venetian. The only thing I must say that it was hard to control the heating in our room, it was too hot. The breakfast was fine but very limited. The last day I think they were slack in replacing the food but it was ok. A great hotel and great location. Staff were friendly and well Venice is always beautiful even this been my 4th visit to this amazing city. Enjoy. This hotel might not be for everyone, but the value for the price was fine. It is close enough to the main attractions to be convenient, but it's not exactly in the middle of the action. There is a vaporetto stop in front of the hotel, which helps. The rooms are very clean, although not very attractive. The bathroom was spotless, but the shower was not exactly easy to use, with water getting everywhere. The beds weren't very comfortable, either, but not the worst. Breakfast was decent.",,,

We travel to San Diego often and decided to try a hotel away from the downtown area. The Sorrento area is just minutes away from downtown San Diego, but is also close to Torrey Pines and La Jolla. We were happy with our choice. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice, and even though our room faced Lusk Street, it was very quiet. Breakfast was the usual Holiday Inn Express fare. The pool was kind of small, but the kids using it seemed to be having lots of fun! My only complaint about our room on the fourth floor was that we couldn't open the window. This necessitated turning on the air conditioning unit, which was noisy. Also, the chair in the ""business area"" needs to be replaced. It's like sitting in a hole! One of our favorite excursions while visiting San Diego was a visit to the wineries in Temecula, which we reached via Highway 78, traveling through the little town of Ramona, famous for avocado and citrus orchards, wine grape production, and the most delicious cinnamon rolls I ever eaten at The Ramona Cafe. If you love visiting gardens, you must see the San Diego Botanical Garden, located in Encinitas. It's a very restful garden with lovely California native plants, magnificent palms, and huge bamboo groves. For the kids there's a large interactive children's garden that's fun for adults too. My wife and I stayed here five days in March 2012. One problem was that, for the first time in our hotel/motel experiences, we could not open a window to get fresh air. Yes having the AC on all the time drowns out any road or freeway noise, but after awhile it would be nice to be able to get some fresh air without having to take the elevator down and run outside. No matter what floor you are on, most hotels have their windows set you can open them, at least, three or four inches. We went next door to Country Inn & Suites By Carlson and found the same thing, top floor windows that wouldn't open at all. Having a Chili's restaurant directly across from the hotel was a plus for us. We were able to order online and, within minutes, walk over a pick up our dinner at the Chili's To Go door. During the week there was very few folks at breakfast, but come the weekend there were so many people and families having eating that they there was no tables available and they kept running out of food. Even though there were signs that said ""Trays Available"" the staff told me ""No, there are no trays."" We thought, if there were trays you could, at least, snag some breakfast and take it back up to your room. Not the case here. Hotel doors are heavy and will slam shut if you let them. Please think about the other guests and make sure your door closes quietly when you enter or exit. Thank You. Hotel desk manager Ester deserves a special thank for her attentiveness to myself . She never gets frustrated or loses her smile even with rude hotel guests. This entire hotel staff will do everything possible to resolve any problem there, though do not expect such after check-in. The Sorrento Valley is close to a major highway and byways, easy drive to Lajolla, the airport, zoo or downtown. However less costly than staying downtown. Also, very quiet neighborhood. Helpful staff. This is the place to go to spend about 10$ extra per night but be in a hotel instead of a motel. Small pool, but even if big I wouldn't have used it. I'm nearly six feet tall, and I fit under the shower head with room to spare, I appreciate large bathrooms, room for two adults. I love this hotel. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is unbeatable, and the employees are probably the nicest people of any hotel I have stayed in before. I'll keep coming back. My only comment (and I've seen this in other Holiday Inns) is the toilet paper. I don't think anyone who builds these hotels has ever sat down and used the toilet. If they had, they would hate it. You have to be a contortionist to be able to reach the toilet paper behind you when you are done. To make it worse, there is this stupid cosmetic metal shield that hangs over the roll which is supposed to look nice. The only problem is that it rips every single sheet of toilet paper one at a time because the toilet paper is thin... So by the time I am done going, my wrist, back and neck all hurt from trying to reach around and tear off one sheet at a time. Seriously, I am surprised that guests haven't tried to rip the thing off. I tried to put it behind the roll, but it didn't work. What's funny is that I asked other people at breakfast, and they all agreed and said the same thing. I just don't think anyone has thought to mention it before. Maybe someone from Intercontinental Hotels will read this and change the design going forward. This is probably not the hotel you want to stay at for a long trip or if your traveling with family. Simple rooms with bare basic features, but cost effective and great when your a tourist on a budget.!! I have to say that my stay was a pleasant one. I was there for three nights on business. My room was clean and spacious. I had a sitting area with a small sofa and a small microwave and fridge at my disposal. At check-in I was greeted with a plate of cookies as well as a gift bag with a bottle of water, a granola bar, and a bag of Doritos. Nice touch. The computer system was down when I checked in, but they verified my reservation off of a checklist and just asked that I come back later to provide a credit card and sign in. They really kept the inconvenience down to a minumum. The complimentary breakfast was hot and plentiful. My only complaint was the lack of a restaurant and bar on the premises. They do have a Chili's restaurant in the parking lot, but they closed rather early as it's in a business district. First, I want to give a warm thank you to two of your professional staff members, Cece & Ester for the warmth and courtesy both of you have shown me. In my opinion, a hotel is just a room. It's the supporting cast the makes one feel at home and that's what I felt while I was here. The room was very clean, but what I appreciate most when traveling is peace and quiet and I got just that. Whenever I come to San diego, this will definitely be my first choice in accommodations. Thank you once again. I highly recommend it to any travelers. I always try to stay with holiday inn express when I am on vacation because of their excellent, consistent service and quality. This hotel did not disappoint, it was new, clean and the staff was so friendly. Breakfast was delicious, my family really enjoyed it. The only reason I did not give full 5 points for the hotel was the location; you need to drive to go everywhere. There is nothing nearby, except Chilis restaurant. The price is really attractive compared to the other hotels located nearer to San Diego attractions like La Jolla, Seaworld, downtown San Diego. I would recommend this hotel if you have a car and are prepared to drive a little. We had a very pleasant stay at the Holiday Inn Express Sorrento Valley. The only negative is that it's about 14 miles from downtown San Diego, so you definitely do need a car in order to stay. However the driving distance to all the sights is perfectly reasonable, especially to La Jolla and Torrey Pines. Room was large with large bathroom, clean, and lots of storage space. Area seemed to be a business park area and was therefore quiet. Unfortunately, the pool was being renovated while we were there so it was closed but we wouldn't have used it anyway. Breakfast was typical continental breakfast, cereal, milk, juices, bagels, buscuits, eggs. My husband didn't like the egg's but I was perfectly fine with everything. Very nice and good value, would stay there again. Service is very good, all the stuff is very pleasant Rooms are clean and large , even a standard room The hotel is in an industrial area so it is difficult to find restaurants and entertainments. Recommended to rent a car if you stay here.",,,

However, it is NOT FREE, and was charged 12USD that comparing to other same level hotels, it's not worth it. (Holiday Inn does a better job) 2. There was mosquitoes(and bed bugs) in the room that bit me. Also, I suspect there is bed bug because after I left the hotel, my body had certain bad reaction that reacted only to the bed bugs.(I can recognize the bites between bed bugs and mosquitoes due to my special body reactions) 3. I doesn't feel good while in this hotel for some reason, I should have chosen other hotels. Before you go to the hotel, they will email you to ask for opinions and requirements. When you are in hotel, they treat you with a free welcome drink. As for the room, I am in a junior king suite. The living room is with bay and city views. That must be one of the most amazing view of Miami from 38 floor! The king size bed was really nice and comfortable. With free breakfast and nice ipad provided, this hotel complete and enhance the whole value of the trip. I like this hotel so much. If I would ever visit Miami area again, I would definitely stay in here. For all the good services, good room, new facility, and nice things here, I love this hotel so so so so much.... Hotel is from 15F to 26F. I think the night view in this hotel is wonderful around almost all the rooms. It's normal holiday inn, and always good quality. This hotel have nice facilities. Old rooms but doesn't look old, indeed they looked classic and cultural! I like their swimming pool, nice light with beautiful southern feeling. The lights in my room was having some trouble, light on and off for awhile, but I was so tired that fell asleep and still felt this is a good hotel. The location is a little bit too far from main activities area, but I park in the parking garage near the national park yankee ship, and went to square for fun at night. If you have a car, there would be no problem going there.","I have stayed at some very nice hotels; however this is by far THE BEST. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I was treated like royalty. The room was incredible! Wood floors, floor to ceiling windows with electric drapes, top of the line electronics, iPad (used to communicate with the hotel for room service, valet, housekeeping and internet, etc) and iPod docking station, surround sound, extremely spacious, and beautiful decor. It seemed as though I was at a luxury high rise condo instead of a hotel. The staff was impeccable! They were friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed during my stay. Breakfast and a welcoming cocktail is included and they both were a nice benefit. There were so many things (pool, basketball, virtual bowling & skee ball, and spa) to do that I didn't want to leave the hotel. My expectations were far exceeded. The price is well worth it for this quality of hotel and Level service. For starters if you have Marriott Rewards points this hotel is a must stay. A bit pricey if you had to pay but they include breakfast and the staff was very helpful and nice. All the rooms come with Ipad's to help assit you if you need anything. Great location. Perfect for a romantic evening to spend and plenty of Restaurants near by. Bed was just amazing. Private Reception for you to check in and out. The room that i stayed in was over 1300 sqaure feet with a whirl pool. I loved it - if to be short:) They try to meet and exceed guests expectations. Starting from their e-mail prior you visit - they check your arrival time and ask for any special requirements..it's a nice touch! Breakfast is included, upon arrival you get complimentary drink and have a smooth check-in at 39 floor if I'm not mistaking. The room is wonderful and full of gadgets which I really love. The view is outstanding and no questions or concerns at all! If you are not looking for a beach hotel this one would be a great choice! This hotel is all about its ""cool"" factor, from the decor to the electronics. So smart of Marriott to pursue this niche boutique market, and launching a hotel in Miami was brilliant. You definitely do NOT feel like you are in a Marriott once you leave the lobby (the hotel is the top several floors of the JW Marriott on Biscayne Boulevard). It was exceptionally clean, which is no small feat with all the glass and stainless steel in the bathroom, and the basics as well as the other amenities were top notch. It can be a bit complicated to operate all of the technology - the alarm clock also turns off the t.v., which lives embedded into a wall until you invite it out with the touch of a button. The gym and other recreational options are also high end. We ordered room service on the hotel-provided iPad and were also able to use the iPad - which had a nice application installed that allowed us to easily request a taxi, call for our car, check in for flights, learn about local attractions, shopping, nightlife, restaurants, etc. The food was not exceptional as it almost seemed like the menu tries too hard to be avant garde, but it was fine and the welcome glass of champagne (one of many choices of welcome ""snacks"") was very nice. It is pricey but we used Marriott points to stay there - now that we know what we will ""get"", we are very likely to return. It is not near South Beach and is not a ""beach"" experience. It is a destination in itself and a perfect place to stay if you are just looking to take in Miami for a few days. You won't know how, but that's ok, you won't care. What a great splurge...they upgraded me to a suite and it was just amazing. Nice brunch in the morning...turn down service where they turn on the radio and lights for your return, and they even re-cleaned the room from my shower. Two huge TVs that automatically swivel on their stand, use of an Ipad, nice pool on 19th floor with great view...what a treat. This was a first class hotel with fantastic Miami views. Hotel staff was very polite but a little slow to respond to room service. Not cheap, but a great experience. The electronics are fabulous! And check out the bathroom sink. Before you go to the hotel, they will email you to ask for opinions and requirements. When you are in hotel, they treat you with a free welcome drink. As for the room, I am in a junior king suite. The living room is with bay and city views. That must be one of the most amazing view of Miami from 38 floor! The king size bed was really nice and comfortable. With free breakfast and nice ipad provided, this hotel complete and enhance the whole value of the trip. I like this hotel so much. If I would ever visit Miami area again, I would definitely stay in here. For all the good services, good room, new facility, and nice things here, I love this hotel so so so so much.... What a find! We stayed for 3 days as a retirement treat and were upgraded to a marvellous suite with both city and bay views - stunning from the 39th floor. The b&o equipment within the room was amazing, the lounge even had its own separate toilet and sink, a great illy espresso machine, electric operated curtains, really comfy couch with chaise lounge. The bed was really comfortable with italian cotton sheeting. The bathroom had a large whirlpool bath, a separate large shower with overhead and wall shower heads. Really cool double sinks that lit the water coming out of the faucet either red or blue depending on the temperature plus a television behind the glass mirror. Ethan and Ryan at the concierge desk couldn't be more welcoming and helpful. The european breakfast was great, made even more enjoyable by the pleasant server Stephanie. These rooms on just 4 floors have their own bar, lounge and TV room areas should you not want to remain in your room. Also worth a mention is the exceptional cooking at the daniel butler restaurant. The $38 fixed price 3 course dinner is great value, again the waiters were first rate. The gym is very well equipped and it was great to watch the boats on the bay whilst on the running machines. The spa is also luxurious, Courtney a brilliant masseuse. I wish we could have stayed there longer. This is a hotel where paying that bit extra really is worth it. I have stayed in some of the leading hotels of the world and can honestly say this hotel should be considered as the creme de la creme. This property is actually the top 4 floors of the JW Marriott Marquis on Biscayne Boulevard, downtown Miami. Steps off of the financial district, Mary Brickell Village and great dining and nightlife. My wife and I had a great stay - beautiful views of Briscayne Bay and the islands and keys off of downtown. High tech to the max and chic decor. Everything was connected by remote control or hotel provided iPad. Totally unreal - was blown away at the luxury, technology views and sexiness of this hotel. Not Cheap - our room, a 1BR luxury suite was going for ~$900/night.",,,
Irina Z,236163,"Review on behalf of my mum... Was her first time in Rome so she was looking at different areas but I insisted on Spanish steps and she says she didn't regret once!! Excellent choice location wise - beautiful atmosphere, close to everything, if you like to walk walking distance everywhere & if you want metro it is just 2 minutes from the hotel. if you want some Brand shopping Prada & Louis Vuitton are at the next street from the hotel. The hotel looks nice & outfitting of the the halls & rooms are antique and beautiful. One of the few hotels that i found that offers king bed for a single occupancy. She didn't want a single bed. Her room had silk on walls & nice furniture, pleasant to be in. The toilet had a shower & nice size. Wifi is free in the whole hotel however the room had a poor signal. Guess this depends on the floor is how far your room is.... Breakfast was fairly ok. Hotel has also a restaurant that is a popular spot& always busy. Staff was helpful & friendly. At the end she made friends with people working there & says she will definitely come back & recommends us & her friends to stay there too!! Mum had absolutely fantastic time in Rome ! And that would not be so without a beautiful hotel ! Location-wise - an excellent place, literally 5 minutes walking distance from the Termini station, walking distance to all main attractions: 20-minute walk to the Colosseum, Spanish steps - 25 minutes walking distance. I won't list them all but everything is close, the only time we needed to catch a bus was to get to the Vatican City and the Vatican Museum. The room is very clean, bathroom could have been a littel bigger however it is very clean too, very well looked after by the owner who is extremely friendly. We were in Rome from 23 till 26 August (quite hot) but we were in heaven when we were inside as the room was airconditioned. Breakfast was excellent too. Can't recommend highly enough. A real value for money! The location of the hotel in the heart of Sultanahment is ideal in order to see the most important objectives. The food is amazing, with so many choices even for a vegetarian! The restaurant has amazing views. The rooms are very cozy and very clean. The service is at highest quality, we were impressed how kind and willing to help was everybody. It will certainly be the choice of my next visit in Istanbul!","I was at this hotel for two nights on a business trip. First of all, the customer service is appalling. People at the desk don't know what they're doing, many of them are nice and you can tell they're making an effort, but they are really not well trained and instructed. Customer service is something you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are very average, trying to be fancy and cool with really tacky and average decor. My room had the heating on at full power and it was impossible to turn it down: I had to open the windows to avoid melting, which resulted in a horrible sore throat the next day. Brilliant. Not to mention the noises coming from the street which woke me up at 5am. The next night I ordered room service, a ""4 formaggi"" (4 cheeses) pizza and a chocolate pannacotta. The pizza was nothing short of awful: 4 cheeses were two, a very dry mozzarella and CREAM CHEESE ! ! ! ! ! cream cheese, on a pizza, in Italy! I was outraged. I spent â¬15 on it, and they even got the wrong kind of pizza the first time round, so I had to wait a total of 1hour and 15 minutes to have my (disappointing) dinner. The pannacotta was really bad as well, a weird texture to it and no flavour at all. Avoid it, you won't regret it. Review on behalf of my mum... Was her first time in Rome so she was looking at different areas but I insisted on Spanish steps and she says she didn't regret once!! Excellent choice location wise - beautiful atmosphere, close to everything, if you like to walk walking distance everywhere & if you want metro it is just 2 minutes from the hotel. if you want some Brand shopping Prada & Louis Vuitton are at the next street from the hotel.

At the end she made friends with people working there & says she will definitely come back & recommends us & her friends to stay there too!! Mum had absolutely fantastic time in Rome ! And that would not be so without a beautiful hotel ! Encountered a lot of problems right from the beginning, when arrived to the place to find out that they offer no free parking (as opposed to what was advertised), and unless you want to drive far away to try your luck in finding an empty slot at a public parking area, you have to pay 56 Euro per day for parking. The elevator is perhaps the smallest and the narrowest in the world! Just like the shower cabin is, having even no soap holder. If you are unlucky to drop the soap while taking shower, then... well, no way to take it back unless you stop taking shower and get out of the cabin! The bathroom has no (and I mean NO) place to put your necessities like toothbrush, shaver, etc... During early morning breakfast hour the staff may open the door to the street and starting bringing merchandise without even caring to apologize for discomfort and the cold they bring in to hotel guests having breakfast at that time. And if you decide to ask them to please close the door, you would only earn their dislike. In short, a very disappointing stay. We had the misfortune to stay in this hotel for one night (three nights booked) our room was on the roof, the mattress was a piece of foam, no mattress cover, on a slatted base, the decor was very tasteless, brown wallpaper on the walls and ceiling, all opening at the seams, the windows were covered with one piece of brown material, the windows were old brown wooden frames and it was very noisy all night. We had dinner in the restaurant, garlic bread fine, pasta too a dente actually chewable and a bottle of house wine it was ok because we were late arriving but it was by far the worst meal we had. My tip, stay in the Majestic. Brilliant and well worth the extra Great location just a few steps from the piazza spagna. Very polite and helpful staff. The rooms spacious and nicely decorated with only one minus the old windows from where you can hear everything from the streets. Nice cafÃ© bar in front of the hotel and a lot of restaurant around hotel. We travel very frequently to Rome and it was our first time at this hotel and we really liked it. Not sure what the regular price of the hotel usually is, but we booked a rate of around US$120 per night. Here are our views of the hotel: 1) Recently renovated, not the greatest taste, but clean and new. 2) Amazing location, it has a very cool bar in the ground floor, and you can go anywhere walking (Via del Corso, Spanish Steps, Via Condotti, etc.) 3) Free Internet!!!- wow wow wow!! 4) Noisy Noisy - Just take some earplugs and you solve the problem 5) Decent breakfast - not all hotels offer free breakfast, it is not amazing, but it saves you a few euros and you can go to lunch to a good place I would definitely go back to this hotel. Rome is usually expensive and this is a very good compromise price-quality. This hotel had a fantastic location. It is minutes to the spanish steps and the Metro. It was located on a narrow street that is one of many lined with restaurants and little boutiques and designer shops. The streets surrounding the hotel were buzzing in the evenings which was great for eating and drinking but very noisy when you were trying to sleep in your room! The windows are old fashioned and although look very nice, not double glazed and keep no noise out whatsoever! The bathroom was of a very low standard. The decor was very basic and shabby, no shower and the tub drain did not work. The staff at reception were pleasant but did not go out of their way for you. They missed my wake up call which caused me to be late for a tour. They were not very concerned. Breakfast, was ok but again staff not very pleasant. It was not a four and I would not stay there again. This hotel had a fantastic location. It is 2 minutes to the spanish steps and a narrow street that is one of many lined with restaurants and little boutiques and designer shops. It was a easy walk to trevi fountain, piazza navona and other attractions. We also easily walked to the vatican and trastevere from here. The streets surrounding the hotel were buzzing in the evenings which was great for eating and drinking but very noisy when you were trying to sleep in your room! The windows are old fashioned and although look very nice, not double glazed and keep no noise out whatsoever! We had a suite with two beds, split almost into two rooms and we had to move to the other bedroom (the smaller of the two) as it was further from the street to be able to sleep! The room was nice but the finish was not to a high standard and it was quite dark. We were however upgraded to a suite as it was our honeymoon which was a nice gesture. The bathroom was of a very low standard. The decor was very basic and shabby. The staff at reception were friendly but at breakfast, we always had to search for someone to ask for a cup of coffee. The food at breakfast was not of a great standard. Again, it was quite basic. We do not feel this hotel is a 4* . It would definitely be more accurate to grade it at 3*. We had a lovely time in Rome and you could not knock the location but we were a little disappointed with everything else as our expectations were a bit higher.",,,
Michele W,258873,"Our family frequents Seattle each year to watch the Seattle Mariners play and this is the hotel of choice for us. They have always been friendly, the rooms are comfortable, the pool is relaxing and is in a great set up and they serve and good breakfast (that's free). The staff has never minded helping us tourist with directions of how to get somewhere and have been very accommodating when it has come to room requests. They also have a shuttle that will pick you up at the airport and also take you to wherever else you need to go to eat or catch another form of transporation to get into the city. As long as they keep it up, they will keep being our place of choice to stay for our Seattle trips. My boyfriend and I just returned from our Playa Del Carmen trip and really enjoyed our stay at the Royal Hideaway! The pros: beautiful grounds, room was very clean and roomy, the staff were always exceptionally nice, the food with the exception of The Azia (Japanese) restaurant was all very good, adults only so very relaxing, never had to worry about getting a chair on the beach or by the pool, always had quick drink service why laying out on the beach, awesome concierge service. The cons: if you're looking for any kind of nightlife or activities, this is not your place, the average age was probably around 60ish, difficult to control temperature in shower, we were in villa 30 which backed-up to a very loud resort and we heard extremely loud music in the evening which was difficult to block out (recommend you get an internal villa instead of one on the perimeter). Also, our patio faced the workerâs entrance and a cement wall bordering the loud and active resort (picture microphone amplified voices for pool games and the resonance of âshots, shots, shotsâ¦.â blaring loudly). Pretty much made our patio unusable. Shout outs for David & Bernardino who served us drinks on the beach - so friendly and happy! Also for Domingo who is a server at Las Palazos (italian) restaurant - awesome service. Our concierge, Laita, was extremely nice and helpful â she even decorated our room for my boyfriendâs birthday! We dove with the onsite dive company (Barrakuda SCUBA) two different times and were lucky enough to have private dives both times! Both of our dive masters - Alex (cenote dive) and Leonardo (Cozumel dive) were unbelievably awesome!! They were very professional and had great people skills. There is no way we could have had a better diving experience!! We would definitely return to the resort for a relaxing vacation! My husband and I have just enjoyed a wonderful break in Venice which was largely due to the relaxing and comfortable stay we had at Villa Beatrice. The warm welcome from this family run hotel and our excellent room meant that we looked forward to returning each evening after day trips to Venice and the Islands. The generous breakfast overlooking the charming garden set us up for the adventures of each day. We took advantage of the hotel bicycles and enjoyed a day of cycling together along the coastal path on the Lido itself. In a very short time we felt like locals helped by the daily bus trip to and from the ferry. We would warmly recommend Hotel Villa Beatrice for a break in Venice.","Hotel Villa Beatrice is like going to stay at your aunt's beautiful holiday home. Welcomed like nowhere else, you feel at home immediately. The garden, with singing birds and nice terrace are perfect for relaxing after a long day. Very comfortable, clean, and easy to get to. By being away from the city center by boat and bus on the lido, you feel the calm settling as you arrive. Beatrice goes out of her way to make you feel at home, and help you along. She booked us an early morning boat-taxi for us that arrived 100 meters from the Villa. I look forward to returning for a family vacation and staying with them again.

In a very short time we felt like locals helped by the daily bus trip to and from the ferry. We would warmly recommend Hotel Villa Beatrice for a break in Venice. We stayed at Hotel Villa Beatrice for one week in October, and we were very satisfied with our stay there. The hotel was easily found close to the bus stop. We had a good room with a balcony overlooking the roomy enclosed garden. In the morning we enjoyed a nice comprehensive breakfast. Villa Beatrice has a quiet atmosphere, and the hosts are serviceminded and friendly. We liked going by vaporetto through a breathtaking seascape to the city, or just walking on the beach, as it was now too cold for bathing.We would like to come back to Villa Beatrice. Hotel Villa Beatrice, even quite far from the center of Venice, it is a perfect place to rest and a really cozy hotel. Very good value, it is very nice place to discover Lido Island. To take the ferry boat every morning to go to San Marco' square was a pleasure (around 20 min) because you can admire the city from there. You can't miss to take the Alilaguna nÃÂº1 from Lido to Train Station: the best way to see all il Canal Grande! Good communication to the airport too (direct Alilaguna to Marco Polo airport) This was our second stay at Hotel Villa Beatrice and we enjoyed it immensely. The villa feels more like a private home than an hotel. Rooms are individually furnished and decorated, while art works throughout the hotel add to its charm. The welcoming proprietor lives in a flat above the hotel and is on hand for assistance, if required. We found service to be discreet and efficient. Our room was a good size with a spare single bed, wardrobe, desk and chairs. The room was fully air-conditioned and also had a ceiling fan, opening windows and adjustable shutters, so it was comfortable in all climatic conditions. The spacious private bathroom was well-equipped and had its own opening window. We initially chose the hotel for its location on the Lido as we were travelling by car and preferred to park the car at the hotel rather than in a remote car park. However, we soon found the location's chief benefit to be the ability to enjoy a beach holiday and a city break simultaneously. There are both a managed beach (deck chairs, restaurant etc) and undeveloped beaches within easy walking distance of the hotel and, even closer, a pizzaria and a direct (privately operated) ferry to Zattare in Venice. At the hotel, we enjoyed continental bufffet breakfast in the private, enclosed, garden, which was also perfect for relaxing and sun-bathing. We took advantage of the hotel's bicycles to visit other parts of the Lido and purchased three-day passes, giving unlimited use of Venice's public transport, for trips further afield. These included travel on buses from the hotel to the Lido's main boat station and waterborne transport to all parts of Venice. Night services on both the boats and the buses enabled us to enjoy Venice's night life before returning to the tranquillity of our hotel. We arrived weary, early in the day. There was confusion beyond the hotel's control over our reservation dates, but the hotel operators did not let the issues get in the way of welcoming us and giving us great service. They adjusted their schedule to accomodate us, and from the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and comfortable. The rooms are comfortable and clearly maintained by people who care. Breakfast was consistently fresh, delicious, and shared with a smile. Don't miss the home-made jams and jellies--the fruit comes right out of the courtyard. And that courtyard--terrific place to gather for a drink, to take a nap, or to play with the ancient little Tutle, Mpouffi, who summers on the Lido with Beatrice and company. We enjoyed everything about our stay there--from great sheets, towels, provisions to free bicycles and guidance to relax around the Lido. The pictures on the web page for the hotel don't come close to doing this place justice. It is a quite oasis amid a lovely section of the Lido...it is at once remote and amid all the ammentities and activities you need--beach is just a half km away and is open to the public--rare in Lido. The hotel is pleasantly appointed with family heirlooms, family art (quite good, by the way), and modern conveniences. All the graciousness of Italy is alive at Villa Beatrice. Places like this are few and far between. We were delighted to land in this enchanted spot and plan to return often....all of the value a family needs with all of the charm of the layers of Venice and the Lido.",,,
Tajine,202461,"I stayed at this hotel because of the price and the fact my flight got in very late and there was a good bus connection. The bus is very convenient and the hotel is around half an hour so it's handy if you need to be near the airport but close to town. The hotel is set on a very busy main road with nothing around. i didn't like the area at all. The hotel is nice with a big reception, restaurant and bar. The staff were friendly enough. The room was big with a slightly aging decor but nothing disagreeable. Bathroom was clean. The aircon didn't work and I found it very very hot in the room. I opened the window but the awful traffic noise outside was unbearable so I had toi shut the window and deal with the heat. I went to the bar and had a few drinks, it was fine, nothing spercial. I nread previous reviews about getting a free city day pass for the metro but they didn't offer me one. In short, if you are spending three or four days in Berlin this hotel is not a good idea. If ther ear etwo of you remember you will need daily metro passes with cost around Â£6 each. I checked out the next day and booked another hotel. If you've never been to Berlin before then the short tram ride from Alexanderplatz to the hotel may seem a bit daunting. It takes you thorough a few of the more edgy areas of the city. Don't let that put you off. Once off the tram the hotel is a walk along a tree lined street around 7 minutes walk. I felt pretty safe. The hotel is really nice as it is really close top the Weisensee. The reception was specious with a small bar that opened at odd times, there's also a beer garden. The room was big and spacious with quite luxurious finishings. The bathroom was nice and there's a tiny galley kitchen which is very useful. Note there's a cheap supermarket on the street corner. The room also had a balcony with a table and chairs. There's a utility room in the basement. I would definitely recommedn this place because of the value for money, the proximity to the lake which is great on a sunny day but also because it's close to Alexanderplatz by tram. The hotel was in a tourist area where there were several other big hotels although to me the area looked dusty and barren. We arrived early so rooms were not cleaned and ready until later in the day. Normally this wouldnât be a problem but after a long flight and with the prospects of having to go back out into the heat it wasnât something I was too happy about. As it happened a room did become available and we did get in early thanks for the really friendly and happy Philippino receptionist. The room was perfectly fine but seemed a bit dark at first because of all the block out curtains to keep the relentless sun. The room wasnât overly large but there was a kitchenette which was useful for a linger stay. What was odd was the smell, it smelt to me like the air conditioning vents needed to be cleaned and were expelling a really damp dusty odor which seeped into your clothes. There was a swimming pool on the roof which was nice but bizarrely when I went to take a pic the pool attendant freaked out and told me to stop and that it was forbidden to take pictures. Reception area is small with a few seats scattered around but not enough for more than 6 people. Most cabs knew the hotel and I took a cab tour with a driver right outside that was really cheap and actually a lot of fun. I also did the one day jeep safari which is a must. It was fantastic. The hotel is probably one of the best locations in Singapore, opposite Raffles and several other 5* properties. Itâs right on The Padang so request one of the Padang view rooms. This isnât the normal sort of chain hotel, itâs first and foremost a club with rooms that I assume help fund the club. So you need to be aware you are subject to club rules. Initially this really put me off and made me feel a bit weary. I am after all on holiday. At check in they explain the rules, no shorts in certain area etc. Check in was a breeze and the staff are lovely. The room is in keeping with the club, sort of older style with dark woods and carpet. However I liked the place and I soon forgot about the few rules they impose. For what I paid the room was amazing value and of a very high standard. The view of the Padang rally is incredible. Bathroom was so modern and clean and I liked the nice touches like the orchids in the bathroom. I went to explore and had a drink in one of the bars. The clubs bars werenât at all for me. They are tired and in real need of renovation. I did use the pool which is great and the breakfast was excellent. I didnât mind that they serve it in the pool bar. In summary I would have no hesitation in recommending this place and I would most definitely stay again. Top marks for an excellent stay guys!","Very friendly staff and clean rooms. Superb beds as well! Best sleep in a long while. Try the free sauna&wellness. Fitness-room was well enough equipped as well. Great value for money. A bit out the touristic centre but with a short ride on tram M4, you'll get there shortly. This hotel was a lucky last-minute offer we managed to book in Berlin. It is located in a quiet residential area, close to a park, close to a supermarket (where you can buy food to cook in the well-equipped mini-kitchen). Rooms are comfortable, very clean, and so is the bathroom. On the fridge there is water offered for free. Internet access is free for one hour per day, though I had trouble making it work in my iPhone. The only drawback: the car parking garage is too narrow, and requires some tricky maneuvering when full. The parking spots themselves are of good size, but they have those movable rails for extra cars to be parked over, which means you might have to shift them around. This hotel is really an option I wish I had discovered earlier in Berlin! Great hotel for a great price! This hotel is not in the center of Berlim, but the neighborhood is nice and quiet. And taking M4 tram, that pass very near the hotel,it's only 10 minutes to Alexanderplatz. The rooms are huge.They have a microwave, fridge/freezer, safe, bath and free wi-fi. The breakfast its not so cheap but it's also great with lots of choices. Despite that the hotel is a bit off the city, you can take the tram (5min walk from the hotel) to Alexanders Platz, which takes 10min. The hotel gives you an tranportcard which you can use to every public transportation in Berlin. Nice staff. Next time I travel to Berlin, I will stay at this hotel:) Booked this hotel for a long duration of about 4 weeks and the cost per night was around 72 Eur. The hotel is located little away from AlexanderPlatz and will take about 20 Mins to reach Alexanderpaltz on Tram M4. It has paid internet connection and they charge 150 Eur a month for internet. But the internet is quiet fast. The receptionist and support staff are really helpful and friendly. they have a good restaurant and also the room comes with attaced Kichennete. Iron and Ironing board can be got on request to the front desk. they have a free sauna and gym, the Pool is good and beautiful. The lobby is big and very artistic. the best floor is 3rd floow where u can see the Balacony to the hotel front desk. The Washing machine and Dryer are located in the basement and services of these can be used via coin operated which charge about 5 EUR and 3 Eur. The hotel does provide 2 bottles of water daily as complimentary and the room cleaning si done twice a week. They hotel has a small basement vending machines where u can get soft drinks, chips and chocolates. There is supermarket located about 5 mins by walk to the hotel. All in all the place is fantastic and an ideal place to stay for longer durations. Only issue is that the hotel is little away from city centre and the place gets dark and empty in the nights. all in all a very nice play to stay. - Got 3rd night for free. - Fridge and stove in room. - Free safe in room. - Pleasant small balcony. - Free Laptop access in the lobby was hard to use (Small font could not be adjusted / No mouse / Log in was difficult / Glare from street window). - Neighborhood felt save and was lit at night. Reason for stars: I give it a 4 and not a 5 because I wouldn't consider it a ""boutique"" hotel. For what it is, I really enjoyed my stay. It had a small kitchenette that was great for fixing up my breakfasts and lunches. Rooms: Great space. The rooms were comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. The kitchenette had most of the thing you would need. There was a tv that was small and dated but I wasn't there to watch tv. I got the daily BBC news and that's all I needed. The room also had a balcony which was great for getting a bit of fresh air or for enjoying a coffee. There were 2 computers in the lobby that could be used for a few euros. Location: Relatively close to town (about 15 mins by bus/train, if I remember correctly). There isn't much in the immediate area except for their bar in the lobby. The bar in the lobby attracted locals for a beer while watching the game. The closest market was a block away and they had most groceries. Value: Great. I would go again if I was in the area. We stayed for 3 nights at Dearg Hotel in Berlin. Although it is not particularly beautiful it doesn't fall short in any sense. Bathrooms and Rooms are very big, there is free internet in the rooms for an hour each day and the staff is polite and helpful although not especially cheerful. The only thing against it is that it is a little bit far from the center of the action, the tram ride is not very long, but it can get packed at times. The real draw back is that the tram stop is 4 longggg blocks away from the hotel in a very quiet residential neighborhood, so once you go back to the hotel it is really hard to muster the evergy to go back out again, (unless you take a cab). So if you are party people this is not in any sense close to ANYTHING at night. If you are the hard core tourist who leaves at 10 AM and returns after a meal in the city this hotel is really good value for money. Beware! the breakfast is not included!!! we thought it was and ended up paying 30 euros a day for it! it is very good anyway so if you are breakfast people it may be worth it! Excellent hotel, with only one glitch. As other reviewers have stated, it is a 15-20 minute tram ride/walk from Alexanderplatz. From Tegel airport, it took about 35-40 minutes (via TXL bus, S41, tram M4). The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk (Antonplatz or Alberinenstr tram stop) in a quiet area near a park and walking trail. There is a Laundry room and Fitness center (older Lifecycle equipment, 1 treadmill, 3 exercise bikes). My room had a balcony, kitchenette (stove, refrigerator, microwave), safe. When I checked in, there was 2 complimentary beers and 2 mineral water. Internet (WiFi) access ranges from 15 mins (2 Euros), 1 hour (4 Euros), 1 day (16 Euros), 1 week (69 Euros). Breakfast is extensive (breads, eggs, cheese, cold cuts, cereal, juices) and is 14 Euros. Portage (Luggage service) is 5 Euro per piece. They are now charging for Travel cards (previous posters indicated that they were complimentary). There is a discount grocery store (Netto) about 5 minutes away. At the intersection of S41 and tram M4 (Greifwalder stop), there is a McDonalds and a couple of large grocery stores, Aldi and Kaiser (A&P). The only glitch was that the hotel charged me for my ""complimentary breakfast"" (Hotwire reservation). I asked the hotel to check into this, but they said it was not their problem (i.e. Hotwire error). My first stay with the Derag Hotel chain and as I didnt know a lot about them, I was slightly apprehensive. The hotel is about 15 minutes out of town and the easiest way to get to it is by a tram from Alexander platz and then a 5 minute walk. Reception were welcoming and helpful and our room was large, clean, modern and like a mini suite, with a stove, microwave and fridge. The hotel merited its 4 star rating and was about half the price you would pay for a similar room in central Berlin. I strongly recomend it If you've never been to Berlin before then the short tram ride from Alexanderplatz to the hotel may seem a bit daunting. It takes you thorough a few of the more edgy areas of the city. Don't let that put you off. Once off the tram the hotel is a walk along a tree lined street around 7 minutes walk. I felt pretty safe. The hotel is really nice as it is really close top the Weisensee. The reception was specious with a small bar that opened at odd times, there's also a beer garden. The room was big and spacious with quite luxurious finishings. The bathroom was nice and there's a tiny galley kitchen which is very useful. Note there's a cheap supermarket on the street corner. The room also had a balcony with a table and chairs. There's a utility room in the basement. I would definitely recommedn this place because of the value for money, the proximity to the lake which is great on a sunny day but also because it's close to Alexanderplatz by tram.",,,
Marko-Caco,626541,"The hotel is huge, and is located some 20-25 minutes direct metro line from the city center (Plaza Espana, Callao etc). The breakfast is excellent, of course, the coffee sucks, but the bar is next door. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and clean. The TV should be flat screen and should offer wider range of TV channels from Europe, and rest of the World. Internet works well, shower is great but as in many other hotels, shampoo and shower gel are not very inspiring. If you arrive late in the evening there is a shop+restaurant just next door open until 1 AM. All in all, very good. What to say, after several years of living in Amsterdam, in private apartments, and student dorms, finally, I had a chance to sleep in a hotel. Once when in Amsterdam, the idea of sitting in your room is never a good idea, therefore, the idea is to find suitably located, and affordable basic hotel. This is Hotel Alfa Plantage. Expect very little, and you will get just a bit more. If you are over 1.85 m tall, pay some more EUR and get yourself a little bit more spacey hotel.","This hostel is really near from the center of Amsterdam and just in front of the zoo. The staff is nice and efficient. But there is a big problem of humidity in the hotel : it smells musty in the corridor and in the room, and consequently, the sheets are cold and damp. Would stay here again, 15 minute stroll into the centre and a very peaceful 2 nights sleep. The room was very small but we were out all day on both days of our stay so it was only to sleep and shower in. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly and the tram (number 9) stops outside, a great stay in Amsterdam and United won too, what more can you ask for. This hotel at a first glance, looked fine. The room had a 45 degrees tilted wall near the bed. I thought it was cool because when I layed in the bed I could see the sky through the window located on this wall. But then I found this to be a major issue as I came to hit my head on some wooden bars used to hold the structure. Bathrooms were ok, clean and heated. The staff was really bad, couldnt help me effectivelly on how to reach touristic locations and when I asked them for a glass of water they just gave me 2 empty glasses. As I asked for the water itself he carelessly said I would have to drink it from the sink. But then, its good if you just want a place to sleep as it is affordable.

Expect very little, and you will get just a bit more. If you are over 1.85 m tall, pay some more EUR and get yourself a little bit more spacey hotel. Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights with 3 friends in twin bedded rooms. The rooms were fairly basic but very clean with good size bathrooms and our rooms were definately a decent size. Doesn't offer breakfast but we didn't find this a problem as there is a super cafe directly opposite. For us the location couldn't have been better. About 15/20 minute walk into the centre (10 euros by taxi) so close enough to get to easily but far enough out that we werent troubled by noise. Would definately stay again. This hotel is lovely!!!!!!! 100% reccommed!!!!!! The room and bathroon were spotlessly clean - looked like it had been recently decorated. The TV had lots of english channels - inc a movie channel. Our shower was really powerful and clean towels were provided daily. The hotel has a lift which was great. The staff were really friendly and welcoming and there was someone on the reception desk 24/7. The hotel location is ideal; far enough away from the town centre to get a peaceful nights sleep but close enough to walk into the town centre. Its a 15 minute walk to the centre but there's lots of shops/market stalls along the way so it's an enjoyable walk. The trams are really frequent - drop off and pick up right outside the hotel. It takes about 5 minutes by tram and cost 2.50 euros. Would definitely stay here again!! Alfa plantage hotel is in the heart of Amsterdam and right across from tram station. Number 14 and 9 are making quite frequent stops that take you to anywhere in Amsterdam. There is no breakfast but there is free wireless internet. No warning on how much parking costs in the city (about 40 Euros for 24 hours). We had booked two rooms but due to the ash clouds we had to cancel our trip a week before our arrival.I called to cancel and I was told that I cannot cancel one of the rooms and was going to be charged to the credit card on file. 2 hours after this conversation, I called again to say that our flight was going to take-off and that I would like to get the room I cancelled back... BUT it was no longer available and that I could only get another standard room for twice the cost. Since we could not cancel the other room, we had to say yes!! When we arrived in the middle of the night, the gentleman at the reception desk gave us our keys, and gave directions to an affordable parking lot. He was very helpful and also recommended a nice restaurant that would be open after midnight. We stayed at room 31: broken doorknob for the bathroom, no remote control for the TV, the faucet was not attached, nose touched the wall when using the toilet, door handle of the room 43 came off. If you are looking for a clean place to sleep in Amsterdam, I think there are better/cheaper options out there. This hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood away from the buzz of the center but next door to many attractions like the Artis zoo, Rembrandt house, hermitage, Portuguese synagogue and resistance museum. In just 15m walk you are in the center (as alternative you can take the tram 9 that stops right in front of the hotel). The rooms are very small and don't expect any room in the closet to store your cloths (the best is to leave everything in the bags) but this is normal in Amsterdam. All the rooms near the center are very small (the big ones are very expensive). You have a clean bathroom with shower (stall shower not just a hole in the floor like some rooms I saw on internet). And you have free wireless (with a good connection). The staffs are friendly and are always available to answer to your questions.",,,
kinkythought,2514911,"We ended up in One by the Five completely by accident -- a computer glitch with Jetsetter allowed us to book a room at the Seven when the hotel was actually full, so we were moved to the sister property. Even that experience was as I would expect a hotel to manage it -- when we arrived for check-in it was obvious there was some problem, but we were treated to complimentary breakfast, told to leave our things in the lobby, and assured that everything would be taken care of. When we came back in the evening, our luggage had already been moved and we were in for the best surprise of the trip! As others have mentioned One by the Five is a private apartment with an atmosphere fully devoted to love and romance. Possibly because we were staying in a 900+ Euro room that we'd only paid $150 Euros for, we didn't get the complimentary champagne and fruit, but it was nonetheless a treat. I can understand some of the complaints that the decor is just ""too much""... I would definitely recommend One by the Five for a romantic getaway of 1 or 2 days, but it could be overkill for an extended period of time. However, our one night was so lovely and comfortable that we completely skipped the plans we'd made for the morning to stay in. The bed is without a doubt the most comfortable I've EVER slept (or done anything else) on. The only hitch was that once the hotel staff left after showing us how to use the ridiculously complicated TV-iPod-lighting room controls, we couldn't get any of it to work again, except the lighting after a whole lot of fiddling.

But honestly, the point of One by the Five is NOT to watch satellite TV! We stayed in the One by the Five for two nights and had a lovely romantic break from the rest of life. The suite is part of a hotel however it is in a separate building and so you are completely left to your own devices - your only interruption will be your breakfast being delivered at a time of your convenience (TIP: Make sure you have already unwrapped the bath robes for when the door-bell rings as they will keep ringing and you will end up fighting with your bath-robe) :) One by the Five is designed to make you think about just the two of you and it really does achieve that well. From the champagne in the fridge, to your own private dance floor, to the cocktail receipes, to Edith Piaf and Barry White on the ipod (they have a really great selection of music tracks), to the bedroom and rain shower - it really is fabulous....and great fun. It is expensive at 940 Euros per night (includes breakfast, the champagne, the fresh fruit in the fridge, the spirits and bottles of water) but it was really worth it and if you want to treat your spouse/partner/partner to be to something special then this is something they won't forget. The staff were great, extremely welcoming and have great recommendations for local places in the Latin Quarter - they really help to make your visit perfect (thanks to all for such a great stay). .....and on final note, the bed is probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in...you never want to leave. This suite is the thing of dreams. It is full of romance and personality. There are surprising accents galore. The vision in creating this experience is phenomenal. I highly recommend this suite for a truly romantic stay unlike anything else. My husband and I spent the best nights of our life in the One by the Five Hotel. The experience is so unique, so amazing... it looks like in a dream or a fairy tale. As soon as you enter in the lounge, the first impression is WOW! And you get in the bedromm, you say Â«Â Oh My God, how magnificent is it!!!Â Â» The One's interior decoration will you make serene and all your daily anxieties will definitely move away from you. You can admire the Parisian starry sky in privacy in your own bedroom, while you have the impression to float on your magic bed in weightlessness. The mattress is so comfortable: you could be unable to leave your room to visit the city. Personnel very professional Love feeling, love atmosphere, LOVE and romanticism: welcome to Paris, welcome to the One! You will LOVE it! We have tried quite few nice upscale hotels but this one is definitely worth trying. Behind an unappealing facade, start an amazing journey. In a typical parisian district, we felt far from everything. The One is THE place for couples looking for an escape, far from the reality of life, looking for complete privacy and above all an amazing experience. I can't say everything about this place as it has to be a bit of surprise, but let say it is the ideal place for a wedding proposal, for a honeymoon or just for a dirty weekend far far from the screaming kids. The design is great, the fittings are luxurious, the bed is a dream, everything has been created to create a one off experience. It is like being in your bubble, the two of you. and if you need a break, Paris is on your doorstep and its restaurants, bars, nightlife etc... So all in all we had an amazing time and we can only recommend this place for couples like us just looking to get away from it all. If you are looking for a hotel with a difference, this is definitely for you and you will not regret it.",,,
kagome999,667847,"My friend and I had been travelling through europe for a few weeks and this was our last stop. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was a nice surprise! We were used to staying at some hostels and budget hotels. We booked the hotel based on reviews from tripadvisor and also because of the low price. When we got to our room, our jaws dropped at how nice the room was (we're students and were traveling on a fairly tight budget). I was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting madrid. Location - this hotel is not in city centre but the metro system is so convenient and well-designed that the distance isn't a problem. There is a metro station about 2 minutes!! It might take 20-40 minutes but once you''re there, everythign else is either walkign distance or a 5 minute ride away. It's pretty close to the airport...about a 20 minute bus ride. The area around the hotel is safe and the restaurants are very reasonably-priced Rooms - clean, comfortable, modern rooms with a FREE mini-fridge (first one that I""ve come across!), and LCD tv. We had no problems with noise. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was teh staff. They didn't seem very friendly and weren't the most helpful in answering our questions. Nevertheless, this was a very pleasant and comfortable stay and I would highly recommend this hotel. We read great reviews about this hotel and it has lived up to the hype. Had a great stay at the Inn at Union Square. From the airport, it was about a 20 min drive. We got a cab and it cost us just over $40. The location was incredible...right at Union square and could easily hop on to the trolley, since the stop was a few steps away from the hotel. It was walkable to Chinatown, the financial district. There was tons of shopping nearby. Public transportation was easy to use and very accessible. We got a 3-day pass for $20 which allowed us to use the trolley and buses. The room was clean and cute. We really appreciated the breakfast, wine & cheese, and cookies at night. The staff are really friendly and helpful as well. Stay here! Stayed for 2 nights, great value because I got a deal through travelzoo. Location - great location, a few minutes walking distance to VIA rail station and metro station, all accessible through the underground path Room - was a bit worried initially because my room is right next to the elevator, but it was very quiet and had no issues with noise. The room itself has a bit of wear and tear, but very comfortable and spacious. The bed was very comfortable!! Amenities - had swimming pool, gym, restaurants, room service Service - great front desk service, very helpful answering my questions. Was very accommodating with giving me a later check-out time when I requested it!

We were looking for accommodations in a good location, but for a reasonable price for the weekend in Montreal. This was the perfect place. Location - walking distance to the core of downtown. Saved us from driving and having to look for parking downtown Rooms - older, but spacious and had everything we needed. It included breakfast in their cafeteria, which had a great selection of food (omelette, bacon, cereal, fruits, etc). There were several conferences going on that weekend at the residence hall, so it was pretty busy. We didn't find it noisy though. I'd recommend this for anyone who is looking for accommodations at a good location for an affordable place and don't mind older furniture.","We were looking for accommodations in a good location, but for a reasonable price for the weekend in Montreal.

I'd recommend this for anyone who is looking for accommodations at a good location for an affordable place and don't mind older furniture. Stayed at this hotel for the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix. All other hotels in downtown Montreal were very expensive!! The residence was very reasonably priced and was in an excellent location. Breakfast was provided in the caferteria (free up to $6) Am planning on going staying again next year! Great place to stay to save a buck, located on the northeastern fringe of McGill's campus about 0.75 km north of most of the downtown action. Definitely a great spot to say for Grand Prix weekend. About a 1 km walk to the nearest train station, and plenty of buses going by to get you around. Easily walking distance to St. Laurent or a short cab ride to Saint Catherines street for amazing bistro dining and bars, with clubs hidden here and there. We only used a cab to and from the airport as there is no other easy access unless you want to drag your suitcases onto the bus. Rooms were nothing special. Ordinary curved glass TV, an empty fridge which was a bonus (there is a Provigo or ""Superstore"" just south of the hotel), and a so-so bed. But for the money, you can't beat it! Definitely 5-star value. Staff were all excellent to interact with and very helpful. Will definitely stay here again for Grand Prix. Good price for Montreal area. Bus stops near front of hotel and you can easily walk to downtown. Don't expect a king size single bed, since this is a student dorm after summer, and rooms are arranged for 2 room mates. Breakfast is limited to $6 worth of food in the cafeteria, then you pay on top of that. Having stayed in Montreal several times it was a pleasure to stay at the McGill New Residence Hall. Formerly a hotel this Residence is now part of McGill University's Residences. It is located close enough to downtown Montreal yet still a few blocks away to get away from the noise of the downtown core. The New Residence Hall is within easy walk of all the major shops and the Metro. The Residence Hall is also connected to a neighbourhood mall with grocery stores, restaurants, bars, drug store and most of anything you would need. The room rate that I had also included a voucher towards breakfast in the Cafeteria. Depending on what you have this voucher will or could cover all the value of your breakfast. Lunch and dinner need to be outside the hall as the cafeteria is only open for breakfast. There are lots of neat bistros and restaurants in the area. When visiting Montreal I would recommend obtaining a OPUS card -- it is a rechargable card (like London's Oyster Card) It is good for travel on the Metro and bus system. Also if you are arriving in Montreal by air at Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport and do not want to take a taxi to town try the new 747 Express Bus. Currently the fare is $7.00 one way (cash only) and includes a 24 hour pass on the rest of the transit and metro. It operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week.",,,

If you're looking for a quiet hotel off the busy streets of Paris, we highly recommend the Hotel de Varenne. My husband and I stayed for a week in February 2012. The room was very clean. We loved having a kitchenette to fix some of our meals. The king sized bed was comfortable.I loved reading a book while I was in the jetted tub.The outdoor hot tub was nice also. They have two heated pools with one end having sand. We didn't use the pools because it was a little too cold when we were there. It is easy to find parking. The breakfast is skimpy. They have individually wrapped danishes and some nice bagels but no juice or fruit. The climate control had a loud fan but it was more like white noise to us. It helped so you didn't hear noise from other people in the building. We only stayed in a one bedroom and really wished it had a couch or more comfortable seating. There were two small chairs to sit in at the table but the TV faced the bed and so it was difficult to watch TV from any other part of the room. Over all it was a nice place to stay especially if you have a car to get around, although they do have shuttles. My husband and I stayed for a week in February 2012. The room was very clean.

We stayed in the Lehua Cottage - the room was incredibly clean and comfortable, had everything we needed and we didn't mind driving to where we wanted to go. Close to Pa'ia (a wonderful, quirky beach town) and Makawao on Maui. The only reason for 4 out of 5 stars is because you need to drive to destinations as opposed to more centrally located accommodations, but we didn't mind. Our desire for this time in Hawaii wasn't a 5-star hotel and we found exactly what we were looking for at Hale Ho'omana. Jeana, Justin, and their staff exude the Hawaiian spirit of aloha and go out of their way to make you feel so very comfortable. Thank you for a wonderful place to stay. We went to this Hale Ho'omana for our 20th anniversary and it was quite simply heavanly. The energy at this place is quite incredible - my meditations were great! The owners went out of their way to accomodate us. In fact, we misplaced an iPhone charger and they bought us a new one!!! If you go there, missing the hot-stone lomi-lomi massage would be an unforgivable crime :) We stayed here with my family renting out the whole place even the overflow house. We had a wonderful stay. Nice to have a big kitchen to cook in and all eat together. It worked out perfectly. We loved the cooler temp and Makawao atmosphere. All in all it was perfect and I'll never forget it! Hale Ho'omana is a beautiful spot away from the overcrowded, touristy areas but not far from interesting little shops and good, casual places to eat. Our unit, Haleakala doesn't look like anything special from the outside but the interior is very nicely updated and furnished in a contemporary style with a touch of Hawaii. The kitchen is stocked with all new items and was exceptionally clean. I didn't get the feeling that I needed to wash anything before using them. I was booking at the last minute and seemed to catch them at a busy time. There was a minor glitch with the phone reservation but after that, the staff were all kind, helpful and welcoming. The property is beautiful and the perfect location for a massage treatment. We cannot say enough amazing things about Hale Hoomana! It is a bit rustic, but in a charming way and you can't beat the price. My kids absolutely LOVED this place...Jeana and Justin told us to make ourselves at home and even gave us a quick tour of the property, taking the time to show the kids where the best fruit was to pick, names of plants, and local stories too. They were so friendly and helpful to recommend good beaches for the kids or kid-friendly restaurants. They know everyone in town, so when we wanted to go paddle-boarding, they hooked us up with somebody for lessons. When we wanted to hear live music, they had a friend playing at one of the restaurant clubs so everywhere we went, we could mention that Jeana sent us and all of a sudden we it was like we were old friends getting special treatment. Each morning, the kids would wake up and run around outside to gather fruit for our breakfast - guavas, bananas, loquats - fascinating. Several mornings, there was yoga offered in a large studio which was so refreshing and fun. I also had the opportunity to get a massage in the spa that was AMAZING!!! It was very peaceful, laid-back and welcoming. If you want to take a step off the beaten path and get the local treatment, this is the place for you. Thanks for a great trip...we will definitely be back! We stayed at Hale Ho'omana in upcountry Maui for two weeks in November and cannot say enough good things about it. Our cabin was very clean, comfortable, supplied with everything we needed to feel and be at home. The peaceful setting is located near hiking, horseback riding, the fabulous Pukalani swim center (two 25 yard pools), and Makawao town stores and restaurants. Beaches are an easy 15 minute drive. The spa and retreat center offers excellent Lomi lomi massages, again reasonably priced, and a variety of workshops (check the website). This is the place to go if you want to avoid the tickytacky condo tourist scene of Kihei and Lahaina or the sterilized, New-York-on-the-beach atmosphere of Wailea. As long time residents of Maui, we decided to spend a couple of days up-country in the Makawao area and do some hiking. We were attracted to Hale Ho'omana based on their website description and the numerous reviews that were very positive. We were very disappointed. This was a rather warm weekend and were surprised that the room did not have a ceiling fan. There was no AC in the unit to compensate for the lack of a fan. Even with the windows open, air circulation was very limited. During this weekend, the owners had also decided to host a large party for friends and neighbors in their spacious backyard. This event went well into the evening and was rather noisy, especially with the back and forth passing of several cars on the gravel path just outside our window for several hours. To minimize the noise, we needed to close the windows and endure the still heat of the room. I wish the owners would have alerted us to the fact that there would be an event that weekend, and that the peace, quiet and ""zen-like"" atmosphere that is touted on their website might be compromised. As it turned out, it was just a rather expensive, hot and noisy room that did not even allow for a good nights sleep. The beautiful Ohana-'family' energy of Hale Ho'omana was comforting and refreshing.....they truly embody the Hawaiian spirit of Aloha and being pono-'balanced' in their relations and service they provide....an amazing experience** Such a blessing for my journey on the island~ Mahalo nui loa Hale Ho'omana! Hale Ho'omana is two acres of sheer bliss. Up country away from the noise but central to everything. Dogs, chickens , organic gardens and products. An environmental ethic that respects the land and people. Great food is not far in Makawao and Paia. Jeana and her family have created something special. Come share it with them. You won't regret it. Hale Ho'omana was a refuge of such peace after 2 days of endless business meetings, that we intend to revisit for the sheer pleasure of resting and enjoying Maui from the top of Olinda! The air at that elevation, the birds and flowers that nauturally grow there contribute to the overall delightful experience.",,,
Jay_Teo,798077,"I am in business trip again and this time I am heading to the trade fair in Hong Kong. High room rate everywhere in business season. I just pick this bontique hotel which is near to the fair venue. Late flight made me check in at night time but the reception was having a long queue. I am very tired and upset. Fortunately the reception lady (Jackie) check me in with a cheerful smile and she talked to me like a friend during the check in process. The lady next to her is busy but still wearing smile on her face. The atmosphere is warm. I request one big bed room and Jackie fulfilled my request. She passed me a Hong Kong Map and showed me the way to the convention centre ( however I will only travel by taxi L0L). Service is very attentive! The room itself is exactly like the pictures on the website. Good to have free internet access for a business traveller like me! Room is clean and tidy. Safe box can fit my notebook, not bad! Not much traffic was noticable even I am in low floor. Lobby bell boy (Andy) in the morning is helpful and he greet me with cheerful smile also. Every staff in the hotel were smiling! Will be back next time but hopefully for leisure! Business trip again for the trade fair, accomodation in Hong Kong is really pricey. This Ovolo in Aberdeen offered an awesome price in the peak season when everywhere is full. Service is very attentive, the manager can greet me with my name when I check in. Its really surprised me! The room is large, staff is friendly and eager to help. Free Wifi! For a comfortable stay at a good price (for Hong Kong) , this is a great choice.","Business trip again for the trade fair, accomodation in Hong Kong is really pricey.

We had found this serviced apartment in Abderdeen because most of the hotels were fully booked due to the time we had flown to Hong Kong. It had cost us just over $ 300 CAD per night to stay here. At first, the place seemed pretty decent as there was ample space,a kitchen to make breakfast, a tv, decent shower etc. Except when I woke up the next morning, i saw 14-15 red marks on my leg, which eventually grew in size and was very itchy. It wasn't mosquitoe bites at all, and fit all the descriptions of bed bugs. This had thoroughly ruined my trip as my leg was now scarred with these gross marks. I had to switch hotels and wash everything so i did not take these bugs back with me to Canada. Not to mention, the front service desk person charged my credit card 4 times because he thought it didn't go through, whereas he had fed the printer paper wrongly. I had to fix the printer paper for him which is absolutely ridiculous because i don't even work there. All in all, due to this beg bug situation, I can't trust OVOLO.

A sort of service apartment in HK at reasonable prices, stay and live away from the city, mingle with the locals in the aberdeen area, taxi only HK$70 to central, very friendly staff, decent sized accommodation, room looks just like the website, wireless broadband very good, we stayed 5 nights, all in all very satisfied and will return and stay here. i especially enjoyed walking around and eating at nearby shops which are good and inexpensive, the staff here are really friendly and helpful, unlilke those at some of the 4 or 5 star hotels in HK central",,,
mowi82,446839,"Was travelling from Belize to Cancun and decided to stay one night in Playa Del Carmen. Hotel Banana is a simpel and fairly priced hotel. English-speaking and helpful staff. Rooms are spacy and defo worth the value. Breakfast was nothing special but it is in a very nice spot with tons of restaurants and cafees right down on the street so many to choose from. The same street does pose a bit of a problem at night time as it gets crowded with tourists looking for a good night out. However, nothing bad about the hotel and the noise problem must be the same for all the hotels in the area. Simple hotel but has everything you need for a big city visit. It is probably more like a hostel than a hotel but it is very nice and clean. As the name indicates, it is inspired by musicians so most of the interior is made from boxes that bands on tour keep there gear in. There is a bar with a pool table in the entrance and nice staff who both serves you drinks in the bar and check you in and out.","The hotel is at the end of the strip and with in walking distance to Mamitas Beach. It is clean and quiet at night. There is a small pool, and the staff are friendly. The man at the front desk was really helpful in finding restaurants and answering questions. A cute little restaurant in the hotel serves breakfast in the morning, generous portions, and the prices are fair. This is an area where Europeans and Americans frequent. Quiet, cute, and family friendly. We reserved it for 3 nights at first ... to see if the reviews were updated and rebooked 3 extra nights trough Booking.com (about 44$ per night). The good: 5 minutes walks from Mamita beach which is the nicest beach in the area. Hotel give discount for rental of chairs & sombrilla at Mamita beach club. 15 minutes walk from Walmart. We have a mini fridge in the room so we were getting our fruits & drinks the evening before so we don't have to spend for luch time. Banana is located on the 5th so you have all the restaurant and shop at your feet. But the hotel is at the end of the street so you are not in the noisy section. We had the room 310; 3rd floor, back side of the hotel so quiet nights. The not yo good: The room is basic and the bed a little bit hard. Needs a little table and maybe a bigger fridge for OUR needs. Wifi was not working in our room so we had to bring our mini laptop to the 2nd floor or the 1st ... when staff saw why we were going around. they say they will fix it .... hope they did! This was a fun trip. We stayed a week and this place was great. The staff was friendly and very accommodating and it is agreat location. My husband and I travel to Playa often and usually with the children to all inclusive hotels, but knowing that 5th Avenue has it all we decided to try something more quaint and less hectic and monotonous as all inclusive are. We came across Hotel Banana and loved it! It's not huge, not all inclusive, but it's clean, comfortable, quiet, the service is amazing and you are within reach of everything you could ask for. Mamitas Beach is a very short walk and the staff couldn't be more helpful...we will definately be staying there again and I have recommended it to many friends who have stayed and feel the same way! Located at the end of the famous shopping strip in Playa, we walked the strip every day. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. We had a room facing the street which was great for people watching. Noisy party the last night, but we were so tired it wasn't a problem. The beach was an easy walk about 4 blocks. Pool at the hotel is tiny and within their atrium. Some construction across the street, not noisy, just unsightly. Very good Cuban restaurant about a block north on 5th.

However, nothing bad about the hotel and the noise problem must be the same for all the hotels in the area. We were at Playa for a wedding. We picked Hotel Banana because it seemed to be the one to fit our needs. From the beginning when getting all the rooms we needed (14) the staff was always available. . Matteo and Roberto answered all my numerous questions via e-mail promptly. On arrival they were friendly and receptive of all our needs. We were 32. We really enjoyed our stay at Banana. It is not a fancy resort but it was very clean and very near the beach. and everyone was very nice. I was right in choosing this hotel for this special occasion. It is at the end of Quinta. Super location. Besides the Italian resIturant next door was really good. Just ask my new I Italian son-in-law. Do not stay here. The desk clerks will insult you and try to get every penny in ""extra fees"". Beware of using any credit card or source where they can take money from you without your consent! I spent 2 days at the Boutique Hotel Banana. since I had never been to Playa Del Carmen, I had some difficulty finding the place, but Roberto, (the owner I assume) gave directions that were very good. I was pleasantly suprised to find the hotel sat at the beginning of the ""stirp"" where all the action takes place in the evening hours and just a couple short blocks from the beautiful Carribean Sea. Ususally I stay at resorts but decided to try out one of the boutique hotels as reffered to me by another. I am so happy I did. Although not overly fancy, it was reasonably priced and clean and very cute. Not to mention the staff was excellent, far more personal than any high priced resort. I had my dog with me and the taff offered to ""dogsit"" while I was gone for the day at Xe-Hal. What a great hotel and I would highly recommend this hotel for the adventureous minded. It was a wonderful experience. Thank you to all the staff of Hotel Banana,I look forward to another stay.",,,
jaineee,1237885,"The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful; both during my stay and before (phone calls, emails, etc.). I was on the 4th floor and there was a lift which was a godsend... its slow, but it works!! The room I had was very small but the bathroom was massive. They were both very clean. The window was small and the people below us could climb out of their window and in through mine because of this weird terrace type structure. This was very concerning as it made sleeping with the window open very uncomfortable and it was a small room in mid summer and that was the only ventilation. Great location. EVERYTHING WAS NEARBY!! OMG....their restaurant is great!! By far the best meal I had on my 2 day trip and I went on ÃÂ£75pp dinner cruise which was nice. Reasonable price too. I never had the breakfast but my husband said it was great. Overall, great trip and great hotel. If you get the right room you cannot go wrong. Definitely would recommend and go back. Owners/staff were very lovely. They were very nice and professional during phone conversations and emails before my stay. They were extremely welcoming. I arrived hours before my check in time and they still offered me breakfast and let me wait for my room in their lounge area. Clean towels every morning. I always slept through breakfast so I cannot comment however while waiting for my room on my first day I saw around 10-15 people come down for breakfast and some had seconds so it must be okay. When I was leaving they were still very kind. I did notice that some people got a second visit discount card but I wasn't offered one. The room was nice.. It was very spacious, clean and had a TV. The carpet in the room should be removed and burned. with that in mind, bring slippers or something. Double bed was cosy, nice firm mattress with mattress protector. The bathroom was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Shower is very powerful and there was always hot water. I took a shower but it was so good I took a bath so I didn't have to get out so soon. Also the bathroom and toilet were very clean. Great location. Close to everything. Overall it is good value for money. I would definitely recommend and come back again. As a female travelling alone it was very safe. This hotel buzz everyone into the door which leads up to rooms.","Hotel is located in the center of the red light district, very close to city center (Dam Square) and Central station, rooms are average without air condition or TV, clean bathroom, I stayed in a 6 persons room with a group of friends, good value of money with typical European breakfast, there was supposed to be free WiFi but it wasn't working !!! The biggest -ve point is the stairs, they are very small and tall, if you have big luggage you will suffer to take them up and down. Thats it, recommended for young groups fro 3 days max. We could have guessed at the grunt on arrival this place would be a bad choice. For over 500 Euros for the easter weekend we didn't think a hello would be too hard. The man and two ladies behind the counter were the rudest we've EVER encountered. There was no way to access the rooms without them buzzing you through. However, they were rarely there and we had to wait for them or find and press the buzzer ourself - great for security! First morning for breakfast the manager did not even talk to anyone - no offers of coffee or tea. Informed prior to arrival am allergic to OJ - that was the only option - couldn't even have water. Our last morning - there was no food left for breakfast - so had to have stale bread with the last 2 pieces of salami. Rooms/bathrooms were fine and big. It is on top of the redlight district. But for the inflated prices you would think customer service would be ok and an easter egg on your plate - no that seemed too much!! NEVER AGAIN! Owners/staff were very lovely.

This hotel buzz everyone into the door which leads up to rooms. We stayed at Hotel 83 at the end of September as a group of friends. We had a brilliant time in Amsterdam and wanted to leave a balanced review as some of the reviews on here left us petrified about what we would find when we got there! Location - Perfect, you could not get a better location for a fab weekend in the dam IF you plan on drinks, dancing, clubs etc. If you want a sophisticated base for the weekend, then dont stay here. Room - the room was clean with fresh towels everyday, the beds were comfy and our view was right of the canal. Was the room basic, yes it was, did this matter? No not really. If you are out seeing the sights, eating nice food and drinking, you dont see much of the room anyway. Hotel facilities - fine for what we needed. Shower, towels, beds, wifi, breakfast (which again was basic but great to line the stomach) perfect!! Staff - we fund the guy on reception great fun. He has a dry sense of humour, agreed, but one wonders if people think he is rude, they may not have the greatest or varied sense of humour themselves. In all, it was perfect for what we needed. Please dont be put off by all the reviews and remember the golden rule . . in a major city, if you pay ÃÂ£45 a night, dont expect The Ritz then complain when you dont get it. (We will be back) :) Stayed here as part of a group of 4 people for a weekend... Hotel 83 is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in throughtout my travelling experiences. Rooms - Grotty, run down and hopelessly under furnished. No iron, no television etc. Bathroom was like something out of a 1950's hospital Stairs - We stayed on the 3rd floor and the stairs up to them rooms actually would give you vertigo. STEEP is an understatement!!! * Group age range was from 26-29...! Food - Breakfast consisted of stale bread, cheese, small amount of meat and fruit. Service - Absolutely appalling... Despite receiving confirmation on 2 occassions that twin rooms had been booked and confirmed we were told we could only have double rooms on arrival... HOTEL? Are they having a laugh? Nothing more than a glorified hostel and a poor one at that.... Absolutely terrible... This Hotel exceeded expectations, we weren't expecting much for the low price we paid for our 1 night stay bed and breakfast. The location of the hotel is superb if your wanting to be in the heart of the red light district and all the pubs and bars. The rooms were basic but clean with decent beds, We had 2, twin rooms and 1 quad room, the quad had its own bathroom, the 2 twin rooms shared one, both the showers were spacious and very powerful, and the toilet areas, were clean. The staff were friendly and helpful, I got in at 3 in the morning only to discover when I went to get into bed that the sheets were filthy and covered in hair, so I went to reception and he changed the bedding straight away. The only downsides are that the stairs are very steep, especially when you've visited the many bars and coffee shops, and the breakfast was disappointing only cereal and cheese and ham and orange juice, not the right food to pull you round from your hangover. All in all this is a great hotel for a short stay in the heart of Amsterdam, I would definitely return. Stayed in the Dam plenty of times, Victoria at ÃÂ£120 one of the best but this was ÃÂ£58 and the best bed ever. Excellent location to walk round Red Light, Dam Sq and Damrak 5 minutes away......... breakfast was good eggs, sausage, ham, cheese, breads. good wake up call. Staff funny in a good way and gave a friendly wlecome. Bulldog (Middle of three over two bridges) cool bar, smoke, pool, sky sports and best ube cool music ever. Adon and Joneele best staff ever/////// back in JAN 2011 This hotel is great value for money,You are right in the middle of the red light district ""the hotel is across from the famous pink elephant of Casa Rosso"",everything is about 2 mins walk at most from here.The rooms are a bit basic & the carpets worn but are clean,what do you expect for 95euro per person each for 3 nights. We were 6 guys on a long weekend ,just here for the weed & women,And we really enjoyed it all,the room has all your basic needs like a bed, a shower, a toilet & clean towels daily , the toilet & shower is NOT SHARED apart from your room friends.You even get breakfast for your quoted price,so if your looking for a mad time in the Dam this is 100 times better than any hostel for the same price,i just wouldnt take any girl on a romantic break here but who in there right mind takes a woman to Amsterdam ,it just seems to be a fun party place for groups in my opinion,Hope you's all enjoy as much as we did. booked the amsterdam flights only 4 weeks before, pretty late for deals on good hotels. Having seen only one review on trip advisor for hotel 83 and some pics on their website I was not sure what we would get for our 450Eur (triple room) it was basic but met our needs as we would not be in the room much. On arrival one of the beds was broken but the owner replaced it by the evening. The nearest metro is about 5-10min walk, but we only used this to get to and from airport, the city is compact so getting around on foot/bike is not a problem. very basic but nevertheless breakfast of bread, cheese and some ham along with tea/coffee is provided Good points: The hotel is very basic but clean and the bathroom was newly renovated, friendly and helpful staff, central location, free wi-fi Bad points: steep stairs to get to the reception and then to the rooms, no lifts but i think this is not unique to this hotel. Could be too loud for the light sleepers, not a family friendly hotel due to the location (right on the main road of red light district) there is no safe in the room this hotel was a pleasure to stay in, great people,made us feel right at home.",,,
John s,279278,"I'm a student and I happened to travel a lot, I stayed in this nice and cousy hotel in the month of March. They mada my stay in Rome the highlight of my trip in Europe, because their accomodation was very nice and it felt like I was home. The staff was very nice and very helpful, plus the gave me tips on how to move around Rome conveniently. The position of the hotel was also convinient, it's near the Terminal station so even if I came back late, I still got the chance to come back to the hotel without a problem. The room was nice and neat and the breakfast is good and sufficient. I suggest this hotel to every traveler who wants to make his stay good in Rome. I'll come back for sure if I ever have the chance again. Very unhappy with the hotel, this is not a 4 diamond luxury hotel. I have been at better Days Inn. The hotel is dark, old looking, needs a good cleaning and has a funny smell to it. The cost of a room and resort fee are way to high for a maybe 1 diamond hotel. They was sand blashing the balaconys while I was trying to rest at the pool, had to move couple time and the management is no help! I found the cheaper resort down the street for my next trip.

We booked for twin rooms, when we got there, they did not have the booking, they gave us a room with no rail in the wardrobe, a double bed and the room was so small you could not open the wardrobe, eventually after complaining they gave us the room next door, but it took a lot of complaining. this was not much better, the shower was so small do not try to use it if you are over a size uk 8, it was beyond a joke, It felt a real dive. it was also lucky we did not need heating,, the aircon looked burnt out with not controls. would avoid. they still charged me the full amount with no apology. Look out as it also goes under other names like Philia. We had a honey moon and was in Rome for 12 days. And we stayed in different 3 Hotels: 1) Des Artistes - it was perfect, nice staff very good breakfast. 2) Then Andreotti - it's was okey, staff was not so friendly and don't speak much English. But breakfast was very good. 3) Then we came in this awful place. It's very mean place. You can decide on your own: - they didn't bring to us any new glasses - shampoo and soap only when we ask on the reception - and after last cleaning brought only one towel. It's room for two. - breakfast is very-very bad - you can take only one coffee and it' very bad and one croissant. I never see something like this before - we book our hotel through HotelTravel.com and they did a nistake in the voucher. And we had to pay but those people ask us for a 100 euros for room instead 70 like on site. And argue with us and threaten with police. It was last day in Rome and we had flight. At least if you ask such money you had provide a good service. My advice never stay in this hotel :( I'm very disappointed they screwed up the last day of our honey moon.",,,
Judy W,98056,"We stayed here for 8 days and were so happy with every aspect of this hotel. The front desk staff initiated assistance with a room-type problem and carried through quickly and pleasantly, the restaurant wait staff were efficient and appropriately chatty, and others we encountered always had a greeting and a smile. The pools, beach, and gardens are very nice and well kept, lots of palms trees, and a small reef viewing area. The hotel is convenient to Old San Juan ... about a 30 minute walk or take a frequent city bus a block from the hotel for 50 cents. Our only complaint would be that there were few restaurant options for lunch and they weren't open for dinner until 6:00. However, the food was good and the pina coladas were great ! Anytime I go to New Orleans I stay at Le Pavillon. It is luxurious, warm and welcoming. I've stayed at Le Pavillon many times and have never had a bad experience. The hotel is within walking distance to the French Quarter, Superdome and Canal St. I always look forward to coming back to the hotel around 10:00 pm to indulge in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and homemade hot chocolate in the lobby. The hotel is beautiful and the beds are so comfortable. It's the favorite of my two children and their families. Also, around Christmas, the Papa Noel rates are great. JWilliams This hotel's service is absolutely fabulous. This is our first time to Paris and we stayed 6 nights at the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. The concierge/navigator services available was outstanding. They assisted us to confirm all of our tours, restaurant reservations and guided us how to take their subway system. All in all this hotel's service is phenomenal. Their fitness faciity was wonderful. Of the 6 nights of my stay I used the fitness center 4-5 times. It allowed me to stay consistent with my fitness routine while I was vacationing which is important. Their business center was also very helpful in guiding us where to go to book advance tickets to avoid busy line-ups. The best part of the rooms is the comfortable beds and pillow. This is the most comfortable hotel bed that I""ve ever stayed in so far. The rooms are soundproof so you don't hear people walking pass the hallway or closing the doors. That is very important to me as I""m a light sleeper. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a modern stay and a central location. Best Marriot hotel that I have stayed in so far. This hotel's service is absolutely fabulous. This is our first time to Paris and we stayed 6 nights at the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. The concierge/navigator services available was outstanding. They assisted us to confirm all of our tours, restaurant reservations and guided us how to take their subway system. All in all this hotel's service is phenomenal. Their fitness faciity was wonderful. Of the 6 nights of my stay I used the fitness center 4-5 times. It allowed me to stay consistent with my fitness routine while I was vacationing which is important. Their business center was also very helpful in guiding us where to go to book advance tickets to avoid busy line-ups. The best part of the rooms is the comfortable beds and pillow. This is the most comfortable hotel bed that I""ve ever stayed in so far. The rooms are soundproof so you don't hear people walking pass the hallway or closing the doors.

Best Marriot hotel that I have stayed in so far. We had a great week-long visit for our anniversary. Loved our 9th floor room with fantastic view of the ocean, rocky coast and beach area. Housekeeping service was great, room was quiet (could hear no other guests), clean and contemporary. We dined at all the restaurants: Solera, La Perla (fantastic!!), and Voga Italian Grill - and would recommend all of them for atmosphere, service, and top notch food. Concierge and front desk staff were all helpful, upbeat and knowledgable. This is a very cool place to stay: expensive but top notch and we would stay there again. We used booking.com to book 3 nights at this hotel which was supposed to include breakfast and free wifi. On checking on, we were told there was no breakfast as it is only served on weekends. Our printed confirmation meant nothing, there is no breakfast Mondays to Fridays. The ""free"" wifi is only okay if it is working which is wasn't. We were then told they had called their ISP but nothing was fixed before we left. We will never stay there again. And booking.com didn't do anything about it either, except to say they contacted the hotel who basically refuted our complaint. This whole episode was badly managed by everyone. Also the hotel is near a noisy highway. Go somewhere else. This hotel's service is absolutely fabulous.

Best Marriot hotel that I have stayed in so far. The hotel was clean and encountered no problems with the room. Staff always greeted us as we passed through lobby. The breakfast room and lobby were under renovation, but the hotel used a conference room for breakfast seating. Food was normal hotel fare, but they did have a variety. Enjoyed the ease of parking- unlike the large casinos where you can drive around in the garages looking for a place to park-twice parked in lot, 3 times on first floor of parking garage. It was nice to leave the noisy casinos at night and come back to a non smoking building and quiet rooms. Would definitely consider coming back again. This hotel's service is absolutely fabulous.

Best Marriot hotel that I have stayed in so far.","My friends and I are college students who drove from Knoxville to Memphis for a Jack White concert. We decided to book this hotel because it was relatively close to Beale Street, and wasn't especially expensive. We stayed on a Tuesday night, so it was very quiet. When we got there, they initially gave us two rooms with a king sized bed instead of two rooms with two doubles in each. The staff apologized and switched our room without any problem. We also locked our key in our room, so we got an extra without any problem. We didn't use the wifi. There was no free breakfast or anything, but we had planned to go to Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken anyway. Pros: The rooms really weren't that bad. They were clean and relatively nice looking. The bathrooms looked very new and very clean. The hotel staff was friendly. The drive from the motel to Beale Street was very short. Cons: Much of the parking lot was being redone, so we couldn't park directly outside of our room. The pool was empty; the pool, ice machines, and vending machines probably hadn't been used in years. The front lobby was being renovated, and the hotel was for sale. It wasn't exactly in the greatest area of town, and the next morning there were some sketchy people lurking around. Only one room had a mini fridge and microwave in it. Overall, I would say for the price, it wasn't terrible. If you're a college student with some friends staying the night after a concert drinking a few beers and partying a little bit, go for it. It's probably ideal for a stay for more than a night or so, and not really a family place, but the hotel could be a lot worse. We used booking.com to book 3 nights at this hotel which was supposed to include breakfast and free wifi. On checking on, we were told there was no breakfast as it is only served on weekends. Our printed confirmation meant nothing, there is no breakfast Mondays to Fridays. The ""free"" wifi is only okay if it is working which is wasn't. We were then told they had called their ISP but nothing was fixed before we left. We will never stay there again. And booking.com didn't do anything about it either, except to say they contacted the hotel who basically refuted our complaint. This whole episode was badly managed by everyone. Also the hotel is near a noisy highway. Go somewhere else. The outside of this hotel seems quite nice and so was the room we were shown when we requested an inspection. However, the room we were placed in was different to the one we were initially shown: it stank, the bathroom sink was clogged and building materials and cigarette butts were strewn everywhere outside our room. Someone knocked on our door in the wee hours of the morning and we heard the cops walking around the grounds during the nght - this did not make me feel safe at all. The pool was covered and did not seem to be in use (not that would have put a toe in anyway). This was by far the worst hotel we stayed at on our trip and I really wish we'd had had computer access to check the reviews here before our stay.... Don't say you weren't warned! They jacked the price up from $53/night on 12/29 to $129/night on 12/30 only because of the Liberty Bowl. It was an absolute rip off. Continental breakfast was very bad coffee, weird looing juice and cold danish in a package. The shuttle to Beale street was $3.50 each way per person. They told us a cab was more expensive. So once we got there we asked a cab driver how much back to hotel and he said around $8. So on New years eve we chose to call a cab. Especially since they decided they weren't going to run the shuttle (even after passing out information upon check in about the shuttle schedule on 12/31). Lots of students staying there which wasn't a big deal because it was Liberty Bowl, but they ran out of towels at the hotel. Towels were nothing more than a piece of cloth anyway, but they should have been more prepared knowing they were sold out. Front desk folks were friendly, but they didn't know anything about the trolley system which is one of the other reasons I chose this paced to begin with (it was on trolley line that went to Beale). It is definitely not a place I'd stay again. Doesn't seem to be the best part of town, even if it was convenient to Beale Street in a cab. this place is a dump need to be shut down fast......... run down bad not safe... trash omg.... When reservations were made, rooms were quoted at $ 120 per night due to the Beale Street Music Festival..when we arrived $145..then with 3 of us in a room, we only had 2 towels..they charged us $10 per extra towel..Rooms were filthy, very run down place...worst part: The cleaning lady told us to lock all of our things in our car when we left, because, the owner always went through the rooms when guests were out!!!!!!!!..Our other friends, also staying there were greeted with a recent hatch of cockroaches...This was the absolutely worst lodging available...I would have preferred joining the homeless on the street corner...!!!!!!!!!!!! I will be researching to find out whom to report this hotel to, something needs done..Do Not Stay Here!!! There is not enough alcohol in Memphis to make this place acceptable. We stayed here for family vacation. Room was average, but no shower curtain (yeah, no shower curtain). So we call and ask for one, it took them forever with their rude attitude. Also, we informed Red Roof Inn Corp. about the horrible experience. They told us this location ""was no longer a Red Roof Inn since May 2010."" Thank God they took their corporate name off!",,,
melblake4,265155,"Highly recommend this resort, peaceful with magnificent views of Lake Marion. Accomodation is clean, spacious and perfect for a vacation getaway. Highly recommend this hotel. Wonderful staff. Spacious rooms, clean and modern. Some of the reviews... You can't please everyone. For the price you pay Oak Plantation exceeds expectations. If you want 5* luxruy creme de la creme then pay for a ritz carlton and stop complaining about small minor issues such as not enough towels. Please! Its hardly a vacation spoiler if the maid forgets to leave 10 towels instead of the 9 she/he leaves. Goodness!! It was clean, plenty of ammentities and spacious accomodation for 2 families. For me it is better than a hotel as the use of a kitchen keeps eating costs down, you can cook instead of paying to go to restaurants every night. I would recommend this resort","This resort is a cut above, it is one to visit if you go to Kissimmee. Safe - guard gated and very helpful and friendly. They drive round the resort too making sure all is ok. Lots to do - nature trails, pools, spa, games, the lake - amazing views and very relaxing local to shops and restaurants very clean area relatively new homes - although they are 'condos' they are more like houses as they are not piled up and there is no one above or below you Great place - would say again! Highly recommend this resort, peaceful with magnificent views of Lake Marion. Accomodation is clean, spacious and perfect for a vacation getaway. We had a wonderful 3/2 villa and were very pleased with it.however there was no staff or office that we ever saw,only security and for the most part they were nice except Jim an ex cop with an I'm big and bad complex and a very smart mouth after waiting for the better part of 1/2 hour for someone to let us in after going out to dinner he showed up and was almost beligerant.hopefully he will be replaced.If you have a boat you have to park it in the woods in a locked lot and you cant get to it unless you go get a guard and ask them to go and let you in to get what is your property.and to play billiards you will have to give up your I D to get the equip to play.The list goes on and on..... and dont even think of swimming any time near dusk muchless dark as the pool closes about an hour before dark and oh yeah lake marion has almost no fish in it .GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!",,,
XFisher,281704,"Located at Reforma, a busy street close to business and political centers of Mexico. It is an old hotel and desperately needs an uplift. Furniture and carpets need to be replaced. Rooms are fair sized and confortable. As in most old hotels in Mexico City, the air conditioning system does not work very good, and this hotel is no exeption. The food at the hotel cafeteria is fine. I have stayed at this hotel many times before (business travel) and this is my first review. I definitely recommend. It is a nice, clean, straightforward hotel. Nothing fancy. The location is very good. Within walking distance there are lots of historic places: Palacio Bellas Artes, Zocalo, Palacio Nacional, Cathedral, Templo Mayor, and the business centers of Reforma. Rooms are clean and fair sized. Be sure not to get a room facing avenida Juarez, you will have a nice view of La Alameda (park) but the noise of the traffic and people goes on past 2AM. The restaurant is fair, do not expect anything fancy. Attendants are very courteous and friendly, as well as the bellboys and the front desk persons. To the side of the hotel, across the street, there is a Hilton hotel which hosts many good restaurants in case you wish to enjoy a more formal lunch or dinner with a good wine. The hotel has free WiFi, and at least in my room the reception was very good. There are also places for those who smoke. From this hotel you can walk to a metro station (a few meters away), Tourist Bus Stop, or if you like and enjoy walking, you can walk to Cibeles, El Prado Museum, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, Barrio Latino. The ladies an the front desk (morning) were very helpful and friendly. I cannot say the same thing about the guys in the afternoon and night. We definitely did not like the breakfast at the hotel. Coffee was awful (to say the least), but there are PLENTY of places to eat close by. Rooms were of good size and clean. We cannot complain about noises, our room faced the back street. I agree with reviewer Sakarah, they should not charge for WiFi which works only in the lobby and first floor, so BEWARE of this. The hotel is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood, away from the noise of the Ramblas and Gran Via. If you enjoy walking, the distance from the hotel to Plaza Catalunya, and the Ramblas is not excessive and you will enjoy the scenery. Also you can walk to the nearest Tour Bus Stop. Front desk persons were friendly and helpful.","Very well localized right in the heart of Mexico City. Very comfortable, clean with excellent service and a great cafeteria. Their buffet breakfast is excellent. Across the street is the famous Alameda Central Park walk a couple of blocks to the right and you start coming across all the sights of the historic center of Mexico City such as the the Palace of Fine Arts, the Latin American Tower which you can ride up to the top and get a spectacular view of the city. Keep walking and you are the Government Palace square with the Cathedral on one end and Government Palace on another surrounded by the Jewelry district, marvelous old churches, theaters, monuments etc. Let me not forget to mention that practically on any of these corners you can hop on the city tour bus and take the great narrated 3+ hour tour all around Distrito Federal that takes you all the way to Chapultepec Park allowing you to get off and hop back on as you wish through out the day for the same reasonable fare. We have stayed at this hotel 3 times and although Mexico City does have more great luxury hotels in the surroundings, I would not have it any other way. This one has given us exactly what we need and until we find something unpleasant from them we will always go back I have stayed at this hotel many times before (business travel) and this is my first review. I definitely recommend. It is a nice, clean, straightforward hotel. Nothing fancy. The location is very good.

The hotel has free WiFi, and at least in my room the reception was very good. There are also places for those who smoke. I found a discount rate for a single room for two (about 55 dollars per night) and it was great! Big room with a nice view. Excellente location if you're visiting the Historic District, Reforma or Plaza de la RepÃºblica. I would definitly stay here again. The hotel has the greatest location you've ever dreamed about, the terrace has a magnificent view of the ""zocalo"" and you can have a romantic dinner there. The rooms are small and some of the has no window at all, so I think it's a bit pricey for the quality of room you get. The hotel has almost nothing in amenities, however the location is fantastic. Imagined you had a long flight, travelling for work, and when you arrive at your room the phone is not working. You complain at the reception and they promise to fix it the next day. On the next day, imagine you worked for 12 hours, had no dinner, so everything you want is to get into your room and ask for room service. But the phone is still not working. You go down to the reception, complain, they say it is a ""problem with the line"" (uau !), and promise to fix it for the next day. And the situation keeps the same forever. I am in my fourth night here, and I still do not have a telephone that works !!! Yesterday they proposed to change my room. At 11 at night, after working for 13 hours, the idea of packing everything, moving to another room and unpacking again sounded like a bad-taste joke. I am sat here waiting for somebody, cannot take a shower (there will be technicians in my room, I guess), cannot order food, simply because ""there is a problem with the line of your room"" I've chosen this hotel based on the positive comments I was here. Now I realize most of the good comments are 4 or 5 years old. The air conditioning does not heat the room properly. There is a couch in my room which has stains. The curtains does not close properly, so I had to use a hair-clip to have it fixed. The hotel's taxis costs 160 pesos to Polanco area, while radio-taxis costs 90 pesos. Extremelly disapointed. Nice hotel, nice location and friendly staff, but for the price I have stayed at better in Mexico City. Arrived late night fto get an early morning flight and would have been happy except that when I woke up with bed bugs. Lucky I was only staying the one night and as a very frequent traveller I had something with me for the bites. So anyway if you stay there just make sure you check your bed before you sleep, I was so tired I just turned off the light, jumped in and crashed. Other negatives were are a hard bed and fairly small room. Decent location in central mexico city. This hotel is located on the Alameda between the Zocalo and Reforma a few blocks from Bellas Artes. While not immediately in the heart of the Zocalo area, it is close and not overly touristy. My family and I had a great stay and returned for another night after travelling around mexico. It is locataed above a small shopping center with chain restaurants/cafes. While we look for more quaint, authentic places to eat, they were nice to have nearyby for kids who like to eat all the time. Staff is excellent and made us feel quite at home in this bustling, chaotic, exciting city. I stayed for 4 days while visiting my customer on July. I had no complains. The room was clean and tidy. Bed was confortable. The cleaning lady was very friendly. Mexico is so dry for someone who lives at sea level humid island like me, I needed about 3 liter of water daily. The cleaning lady was so nice of leaving me couple more free bottle water. The breakfast buffet was nice however monotone after 4 days. They barely change menu. I love the juice!! Specially grapefruit juice. Since the hotel is inside a small mall and lobby on the second floor, it is hard for someone who visit for the first time to figure out where to check in. Lack of a helping hand on the ground level took away 1 point from service. However at the lobby both Adriana and Laura was so friendly and helpful. Hotel taxi was very expensive in comparison with the ""street"" taxi. I spoke spanish and stayed for 2 years in Mexico so I dared to take ""street"" taxi, however it's not recommended for someone who visit Mexico City for the first time. Overall it is an excellent hotel!!",,,
twigor,1165950,"Stayed here two nights recently. The rooms are very basic and quite small, typical of an older mid-city Europeon hotel. The staff was quite friendly and helpful in providing directions, etc. They stored our luggage as we arrived early morning and allowed us to check in earlier in the day than their policy. Very clean and great central location to many of the Madrid sites. It was quite hot during our stay requiring us to slid the bed over due to a dripping AC unit. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient not far off Calle de Grand Via, close to metro and major sites. The rooms were basic but clean and offered a comfortable bed. The bathroom in our room was very small making it difficult to manuver while performing routine tasks. While the room was clean, there was some mold in the grout of the shower/tub area..","Stayed here two nights recently.

Very clean and great central location to many of the Madrid sites. It was quite hot during our stay requiring us to slid the bed over due to a dripping AC unit. My husband and I spent one night here in December 2011. Hostal Besaya has a great location and makes it easy to walk to various sights, or hop on the metro. The hostel staff were very nice and accommodating. We arrived before check in, but were allowed immediate access to our room. We spent 2 weeks in Spain and I think that Hostal Besaya provided us with the best and most reliable wifi access. The room was clean and comfortable, we had a private bath and a private small balcony. We could hear the street noise from our room, but Madrid is a big city and this should be expected. Overall, no complaints, and we would recommend Hostal Besaya to people wanting a cheap but comfortable and clean place to stay in Madrid. I stayed in this hostal in december 2011. I stayed in a privat room with private bath. The room wasn't very big, but surely big enough to spend the night and spread out clothing. The room was clean and neatly furbished. The bathroom was complete with toilet, basin and shower. All functioning properly. The staff is helpfull and speak quite some English. Checkout it at 12, and you can leave your luggage at the hotel for safekeeping. A perfect place for a weekend away, alone, or as a couple cuz the double private rooms are just as good. This was my first time staying in a hostal and I was pleased that I picked the Hostal Besaya. The hostal is located on the 8th floor of a very elegant looking building right on the Gran Via and Calle de San Bernardo with a metro station on the opposite corner which makes getting around Madrid very easy. There is a very small lobby on the 8th floor which handles the check in and while the lobby door is locked a press of the bell always brought someone to open the door very quickly no matter what time of day or night. My room 801 was a very small but very clean and neat single room with a little balcony with a great view of the Gran Via. The room had a single bed, bedside table, wardrobe and a desk and chair, free fast wifi and an LCD TV completed the room. The bathroom was equally as small but again clean and tidy but the toilet in it was a very strange, to me at least with some kind of mechanical box behind it which made a noise every time it was flushed but did the job. While the room was small there was a large communal living room on the corner of the building with a TV some sofas and again great views of the Gran Via which came in handy for watching the Madrid Pride on the Saturday night. The staff were very nice and helpful but not all of them spoke a lot of English but I had no problems during my stay. I had a great stay here and would stay again. I stayed at Hostal Besaya twice in July and thought it was a great value. Right in the center of Madrid near the Gran Via and close to major attractions. The hop on hop off tour bus is nearby and the metro. The rooms were basic but spotless , modern and comfortable with flat screen TV and A/C. They had a nice communal living room and free wi-fi.The people at the front desk are very helpful but mostly speak Spanish so bring your dictionary! I suggest asking for an interior room as rooms facing the street are noisy because Madrid is a city that never sleeps! The single room was only 52 Euros in the height of the season which was a deal! Highly recommended!",,,
Schneider231,1214250,"Our room was as advertised, hotel was fairly quiet, easily accessible, plenty of stores and restaraunts nearby. We stayed while taking my son to Butler University. Breakfast room was nice, windows faced the outside pool. Breakfast selections were meager. Only had Apple Juice no orange juice, small fresh fruit selection. Our room was a worn (shelf in bathroom was wobbly) and smelled of chlorine. Able to open patio doors to air out room, was decent for price. Did not have fitness center on site, had arrangements with local gym. Stayed in Indy one night while visiting son at college. Basic room, no frills. Very reasonable price, convenient restaruants within walking distance (Denny's, Cracker Barrell, Outback, Steak and Shake, Joes Crab shack.) Bare bones breakfast at hotel, no pool. Small rooms, friendly staff, Very convenient right off exit of I-70. Would recommend for an overnight stay on the way to somewhere else,","I always stay here during my I-70 road trips. The people are nice and the rooms are clean. It's a good price for a good room, so you pay for what you get. People get upset over the littlest things, carpet, walls, whatever - as long as the sheets are clean and it's quiet. I get it, it's not the Bellagio of the Midwest, but it's okay - you'll make it through. I agree with the other reviewers. This hotels high speed is decent, the tvs are nice, in fact, it was nice to have the option of the ""theme"" on the tv which was the moon over the ocean with the sound of waves. Nice way to coast off to sleep :) Only downside (we stayed for two weeks for business purposes) the TV guide menu was an hour advanced. You could never see what was currently on. Asked to get problem fixed, but never was addressed. Continental Breakfast was OK too. Robert was a good front desk employee though! If you are going to stay, try to stay on the BACK half of the hotel as there is a lot of noise from the expressway on the front side. We came here after we had a horrible experience at the Days Inn across the highway. The room was nice and comfortable, but the carpet was a little stained and worn. It looks like the hotel is getting a little worn, in general. They have nice 32"" flat screen TVs in the rooms, and the free wireless internet was fast. Just a basic hotel, and what you would expect for the price. Also, if you are military, they will give you a discount. The front desk was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was basic - waffles, eggs, breads, muffins, fruit, yogurt, and drinks. Not sure what is in the area, but there were tons of sirens form emergency vehicles going when we arrived, and we heard them later that next morning. There might be a fire station nearby. For the last four years, our daughter has been involved in a competition in Indianapolis. During that time, we've always stayed at this hotel based on price and location. After this most recent stay however, I can say that we will not be staying here next year. The property has become very rundown, and seems to be the new place to stay for truck drivers that are awaiting their next assignment from a depot located down the street. Our room was not very clean, and the carpet was very worn and dirty. I had to take a towel and wipe hairs off the vanity when I went to use the sink....ewwww. Also, there seemed to be random people always walking around the parking lot. My husband was approached by someone asking for money!! There is a Steak and Shake located directly behind that is open 24 hours; not sure if this had anything to do with it. We returned from our evening around 12:30 a.m. and there was a group of four guys hanging out by the main entrance smoking. Also, the breakfast bar left ALOT to be desired. I realize this is complimentary, but one waffle maker and some items to toast is not too exciting. I recently brought a group of teenagers there for the National FFA Convention. The staff was most courteous and helpful. There are several restaurants within walking distance and access to downtown was quick. The rooms were not fancy but they were clean and smelled fresh. We will stay there again. Hotel was dated a little bit but was clean. Rate was great and front desk handled the reservation very effciently. Stayed in Indy one night while visiting son at college. Basic room, no frills. Very reasonable price, convenient restaruants within walking distance (Denny's, Cracker Barrell, Outback, Steak and Shake, Joes Crab shack.) Bare bones breakfast at hotel, no pool. Small rooms, friendly staff, Very convenient right off exit of I-70. Would recommend for an overnight stay on the way to somewhere else, The La Quinta Inn is located one exit east of the I-465 loop, and it's an ez-off/ez-on situation. I guess there are a couple of La Quintas on this side of town -- this is the one on Post Road. There is a gas station right by the motel, and a ton of restaurants within walking distance -- Wendy's, Denny's Steak and Shake, Cracker Barrel, Outback, and a few others. I think I might have seen a Joe's Crab Shack sign. Check-in and check-out were fast and friendly. The room and hallways were clean and the furnishings -- bedding, carpets, etc. -- were all very nice. The TV only had a few channels. The bed was pretty comfortable, and the wireless Internet was very good, even though I was at the end of the hall on the top floor. My room was on the front side of the hotel facing Post Road, I-70, and the I-70 entrance ramp, so there was a little bit of noise but it wasn't too bad. You may want to ask for a room on the back side which I would expect to be very quiet. Oh, did I mention the price is great? The quality of the motel is not quite up to the standards of a Hampton or Holiday Inn Express, but it was very good -- better than the vast majority of Super 8s or Days Inns -- and for the price (around 60 bucks with tax) I would call it a superb value in Indy. We have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed. It is exactly what we want from a budget chain hotel. For us, it is a very convenient location with easy access to the interstate. Plenty of free parking. Six family-type restaurants within easy walking distance. Front desk is simple but friendly and efficient. Rooms are clean, albeit basic. Free breakfast is very basic. Surrounded by neighborhood, which provides us with plenty of space for jogging in the early morning. Most importantly, the price is right.",,,
CG_ATL,2514251,"My sister and I were snowed in NYC the weekend before Christmas and moved to the W when our first hotel refused to let us extend our stay on points and demanded an exorbitant rate for the ""privilege"". The W not only let us stay on points in prime season, the staff made our stay the one part of the trip that was hassle-free. They were friendly and every request was met with an attitude of ""no problem, we'll take care of it"". We didn't know from day to day when we would be able to get a flight out, and the front desk staff made sure we didn't have to worry about it - they blocked us in the same room and were extremely flexible with us, recognizing that we had no control over the airline dilemma! In past years, prior to the renovation at this hotel, I had experienced an attitude among the staff that was in no way backed up or warranted by the quality of the experience. They were riding on the coattails of the W Hotel chain's reputation. The rooms and hallways were very worn and past their prime, yet the staff often acted like we were lucky to be there since it was so ""cool."" The rooms are still small, but they are much nicer post-renovation, and the attitude of the staff has completely changed for the better - we were made to feel that our business was appreciated and that they were happy to help. I will definitely go back, and would encourage others who may have had mediocre experiences in the past to give them another chance - you may be pleasantly surprised. I stayed in two different rooms because the first room was unusually hot. After being told in the morning that an engineer would fix my thermostat, I returned to a room that was even hotter, only to be told the thermostats were irrelevant, the hotel was in ""winter"" mode and it was only blowing heat! They moved me to another room that was much cooler, and as the outdoor temperature dropped, so did my room temperature, but it was better than being hot. The beds were good and both rooms were clean in terms of housekeeping, but the couches were stained, the walls and flooring showed wear, as did the showers, which are very small. This hotel was very adequate, but definitely does not fall into the luxury category. Check-in was a breeze for me, but my colleagues had to check in at the Millenium and the line was more than 15 people deep and slow, so it is luck of the draw on the check-in experience. My sister and I were snowed in NYC the weekend before Christmas and moved to the W when our first hotel refused to let us extend our stay on points and demanded an exorbitant rate for the ""privilege"". The W not only let us stay on points in prime season, the staff made our stay the one part of the trip that was hassle-free. They were friendly and every request was met with an attitude of ""no problem, we'll take care of it"". We didn't know from day to day when we would be able to get a flight out, and the front desk staff made sure we didn't have to worry about it - they blocked us in the same room and were extremely flexible with us, recognizing that we had no control over the airline dilemma! In past years, prior to the renovation at this hotel, I had experienced an attitude among the staff that was in no way backed up or warranted by the quality of the experience. They were riding on the coattails of the W Hotel chain's reputation. The rooms and hallways were very worn and past their prime, yet the staff often acted like we were lucky to be there since it was so ""cool."" The rooms are still small, but they are much nicer post-renovation, and the attitude of the staff has completely changed for the better - we were made to feel that our business was appreciated and that they were happy to help.

This is one of my favorite places to stay in New York City. The hotel is very conveniently located for me, for business meetings and for entertainment venues. The facility is modern, stylish with a minimalist approach to furnishings, clean and very quiet. A guest lounge has breakfast available in the morning and hors d'oeurves available in the evening. Like some of the other reviewers I arrived while the desk staff was at lunch but this has happened before and I am accustomed to handling check-in at the Millenium Hotel. If you have the misfortune to arrive while a large group is checking in this can result in annoying delays but I generally have been lucky. I'll be back. We arrived in the rain on Friday night for a two night stay around 7:30 p.m. When we went to check in at the Premier there was no one there to help us as it was their dinner break. That is all well and good and it was not much trouble going over to the Millennium to get checked-in. I did notice that there was more than one concierge at the desk in the Millennium and was wondering why one of that staff might not be sent to the Premier to cover the break so the desk was covered at all times. We arrived at our room as was pleased. I did notice that there were some stains on the sofa and although the bed was great, the rest of the furniture could use an upgrade. I ordered ice at 10:55 p.m. and at 11:30 p.m. I had to call again as it had not arrived. On the second call, the ice was delivered in 7 minutes. Should there be an easier way to get ice??? Monique, the Premier concierge who we met on Saturday, was knowledgeable, exact, helpful and had a wonderful personality. This was a highlight for use as we gathered information on activities for the day. She's a keeper. Was a little disapointed in the breakfast. When we last stayed there a number of years ago it felt like there was more variety. I did have to ask for water as there was none out. It was delivered promptly. We will choose this hotel again, but hopefully my few concerns will be addressed. I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Premier Hotel--what a pleasant surprise! I was booked at the Millenium, but upon checking in after a long day of travel, was upgraded to The Premier Hotel. Justin at the front desk was delightful. My room was beautiful and immaculate. I didn't get the chance to try the continental breakfast or the happy hours, so can't comment on that, except to say that I was using the computer to print boarding passes and the selection looked nice. I loved that there was a very good feeling of privacy/security. My only suggestion for improvement is that I would have liked in-room wireless, as by the time I got back to the hotel, I didn't feel like going down to the Mezzanine to read my tablet. Location is great; steps away from Times Square and the subway. I would definitely consider coming back for another stay! Travel with 2 young kids alone during July, was told by front desk kids were not allowed to go to Breakfast Area during the snacks time and I did not see anywhere in the Hotel Web Page mention about it at all. Strange thing happened again when I was 2nd in line during the check out, the front desk just ignored me and talk to a man with business suit just step out from the elevator who said he was in a rush. Noone even said a word to me if I mind to let to this man to do the check out first So my conclusion is Businessman welcome and family with kids sucks.. I found this hotel through affiliate of Orbitz for a reasonable price (for NYC standards). This was my 6 years old first overnight stay in New York and this hotel had great location on the heart of everything. Since we arrived around 10 am we were able to use the option to leave our luggage until the normal check in time and still not missing on the sightseeings either. The staff was very polite and helpful to us. Great perk was the complimentary drinks and hors dâoeuvres between 5 and 7 and the breakfast in the morning with fresh fruits, muffins, yogurt, juice and coffee. I mean how many things are free in New York! The hotel room key is the only way to use the elevator, which is a nice thought for the guests and their safety. Our room was pretty nice with a modern flair. I found our room to be spacious for New York standards and very quiet considering that the hotel is few hundred feet from Time's square. Bathroom is nice and big with separate shower and bath tub. It was clean,but I will suggest to try to clean better underneath the glass counter and the shower tiles. From the amenities what every room should be equipped ours did not had the bathrobe, but it was not something I really needed anyway. Also, there was a nice choice of teas and coffee in the room.You might consider that if you apply for their hotel rewards card on site you will be entitled for 2 complimentary items from the bar in your room. I need to thank personally Patrick from the concierge staff who despite that was at the end of his shift spend extra time with my son to make him feel welcomed. I also need to thank the security who was able to come quickly and resolve a little glitch with the security safe caused by my lovely kid (lesson learned - never forget the code lol). I highly recommend this boutique hotel to all. Personally, I am already looking to reserve the same hotel in September for a Broadway trip. Thank you Polina The location was great and despite how close the hotel is to all the action, it's pretty quiet inside. While we had one of the better rooms in the hotel, it still wasn't particularly great. * The complimentary breakfast is cold and pretty bland. It seems like it's hosted in a spare room, pretty plain. * The rooms look a little tired around the edges. * While the hotel was ok, it really didn't seem worth + $400 p/n On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and it's a great location if you want to be near Time Square. This is the most private hotel I've stayed at in NY. The decor is very modern and very clean. The room feels like the Sofitel a couple blocks away with a couple exceptions. As others have noted the staffing is very light as they service from the Millenium hotel, next door through a theatre lobby. No restaurant, no gift shop, but a nice lounge on the mezzanine with a good, free breakfast in the morning and drinks & snacks after work. Great location, great corporate rate, I really like it. Two small issues - the showers are really small and a little primitive, hidden behind the door, and sometimes I haven't been able to get hot water in the morning, only warm. Second, the TV's are set up with a funky aftermarket remote control/receiver that works quite poorly. No channel flipping here - you can only input one signal every 30 seconds or so, very annoying. All in all, I'm very happy to stay here when I'm in the city. We flew to New York for 2 shows and an overnight stay. When we checked into the Millenium, not only were we given an early check-in (it was only 10:30am!), but we were upgraded to a room at The Premier Hotel. The room was big, by NYC standards and included some nice amenities (flat screen tv, coffee pot in room and a decent size bathroom). However, the lighting set up was weird-you could not have one bedside lamp on by itself. The other REALLY annoying thing about the hotel was the towels. They didn't seem to dry very well and, worse than that, they left huge amounts of lint on hands.body, hair. On the plus side-everyone we encountered at the hotel was very, very nice.",,,
Letizia G,296327,"After almost a week in the hotel I can say: - The service is great and the staff is well trained, helpful and speaks English - There is an awesome view from the restaurant - I got a corner room, very old fashion but charming. The/Coffee facilities in the room - Even though the hotel is not in the main city center there is a tram just in the from of the hotel to take you to Taksim - The only issue I met was with the WIFI internet connection but I was provided with a cable. - On my floor there were some very noisy clients, the receptionist try to help me but the hotel is certainly responsible for other client behavior. Istanbul is a awesome city and I recommand to visit it. My room was nicer than expected but mostly important the service is great. The room bathroom is very big (compared to the room size) and there is an exceptional shower. I finally got the place to display all my things in the bathroom since there is a lot of place near the sink. There is free WIFI connection working properly everywhere. The breakfast is good although during my stay every morning the restaurant was really crowed and you may wait 5/10 minutes on the line to get your coffee. The prices vs quality is quite high I therefore recommend this hotel. The location is also great since there is a direct bus from the airport.","The breakfast is good, staffs are polite and able to speak english. We can found free internet wifi connection.

Istanbul is a awesome city and I recommand to visit it. Why has nobody mentioned how haunted this hotel is? I got confirmation that it is by the hotel staff!! What i experienced: lights and tv switching on and off by themselves, woken up by ghosts when I was sleeping, you feel their presence and they tried dragging me out of bed. Ever seen the movie Paranormal Activity? Just like that. I heard noises and chants. The second night after being dragged out of bed I ran to my friend's room who was staying right below mine. I then heard on my room above heels clicking hard and objects being dropped. Freaaaky! The first night i was so scared i spent the night in the lobby by the restaurant which was closed. Yet, the lights and tv kept switching on and off. I cut my 7 day trip short and fled the country after 2 nights. DO NOT STAY HERE. I stayed here with a group in October 2010. The staff was very friendly. It's close to the public rail system and you can go right to the Bazaar... not to be missed. You will hear the mosque alarm clock if you sleep with the windows open. Ramada Old City Hotel is really a great place to stay, I think it's perfect for families.. The location is very accessible to the tourist spots, and even if the hotel itself is not that big, it's very tidy and it has a friendly and safe ambience. It's my family's first time in Turkey (they came from Philippines for my wedding)and I was quite afraid the hotel wont meet their expectations. My family was even surprised to arrive in the room exactly as I have seen it in photos (I think it's even better!); plus they did personalize some stuffs in advance like my request for a 3rd bed for my nephew at no extra cost, extra slippers and robes, and of course, all our 3 rooms' LCD TV has a welcome banner for my family! The rooftop breakfast is perfect, the food and location is amazing. :) The hotel price is quite high, but it's worth every penny you spend. Check-out was swift, the staff are very courteous, and they speak good English :D More power, Ramada Old City! First, the positive things: The hotel is pretty well located, about a 20-minute tram ride to the main tourist area. It's in a pretty nice neighborhood. The (small) rooms are clean and some have nice views of spectacular mosques. In the context of the prices of other Istanbul hotels, the value is pretty good. Some of the people who work there are very nice and helpful Real Problems: Some of the people at the front desk are rude and extremely unhelpful. When a friend of mine, a Turkish-speaking local, called and asked to speak to me, the person at the front desk refused to look up the room that I was in and connect her to me and hung up on her. The ""business center"" is pretty inadequate. There are 2 computers but one was broken the entire week that I was there and the working was was so obsolete as to be difficult to use at times. It was hard to use it also because with only one computer, there was a long line. The line was longer because hotel staff members used it to chat on Skype while guests waited. The hotel tried to steer me towards the buffet breakfast without mentioning that, while it is complimentary for most people, it is a whopping (and hugely overpriced) 20 euros for people who book through Orbitz. It's also the only hotel in that price range that I know of that reuses the boxes for the soaps in the bathroom (sanitary?). In all, the location is pretty good and value is pretty good, but there are real issues to be aware of. And probably not the best place if you need to do business (have access to a fax machine or scanner) or if you want access to the internet through a hotel computer. A not-so-big hotel in a good location that affords a fantastic view of Istanbul from its dining room and terrace. The breakfasts were very excellent with many varieties of food. I have stayed at Ramada old city four times, twice for business and twice for leisure. On the business trips, although it's a 4star hotel, yet the business center is reliable and fully equipped, wi-fi in all rooms and meeting rooms were fully equipped (air condition, sound, light, projector and a very rich coffee break) As for leisure, the hotel staff were extremly helpful, 100% garateed to be clean, very comfi beds and pillows, LCD and minibar. Bathrooms are extra clean with hot and cold water. (unlike many 4star hotels in Istanbul, this one is 100% reliable for being clean and comfi beds). The only issue is that the rooms are kinda small, so if you are Big&Tall, ask for a superior room. Breackfast is very rich including all sorts of bread, eggs, hot and cold varieties and juices and coffee or tea and the service is very fast and people are very friendly and polite. The location is a bit far from the historical area (20mins tram ride) but compensated with bus station, taxi stop and tram station litrary at the door step, in addition to the option of the yellow minibusses passing by the doorstep. The area of findikzade is alive, with plenty of groceries and supermarkets for water and treats shopping, in addition to a large and good shopping mall just at the adjacent back street (u cant miss it). This is a 100% recommended hotel especially for elder people not tolerating bad service, hard beds or uncleanliness. Thanks Excellent location close to the main attractions. Great view from the restaurant. Rooms were a little on the small side but were clean and well maintained. With the tram line/stop very close by, this hotel gives you easy access to all the main sights. Although small, the rooms were modern, clean & included tea & coffee making facilities in each room. I did not eat dinner there, but the buffet breakfast was good - plenty of variety & a terrific view through to the water. Wifi was free & worked well. Airconditioning centrally controlled & was overheated for our January stay. Far away from the ""Old City"", to be called like that. small rooms, clean. They tried to avoid the dinner included on the package. After claim to agent they gave us the a fix menu at the bar... They have a restaurant on the 7th floor... The view fromthat restaurant is the only thing spetacular of the hotel! We spent three nights in Ramada Istanbul Old City hotel. Everything was as you would expect from a 4* business hotel. The room was on the smaller side, but this is typical for hotels in downtown Istanbul. The room and the bathroom were both clean and in a very good condition. Most of the rooms in the hotel are facing a busy road and also there seem to be about five mosques in a very close proximity, but the double windows do a very good job and we didn't hear a thing from outside. We could however hear the shower and toilet flushing of our neighbours. Can't comment about the breakfast because it wasn't part of our package, the hotel charges 15 euro per person, which we though was a bit silly to pay bearing in mind the local places, where the 4 of us could eat for the same amount. There is a free WIFI with reasonable speed in the hotel. All the staff were very nice and helpful (and trust me I do not say this very often). The hotel is about 6 tram stops away from the main sights like the blue mosque, the trams are modern and easy to use, but at times they get very busy and crowded. I felt a few times on the tram that the local men ""enjoyed"" being crowded with me, which wasn't a very pleasant experience, so ladies watch out...",,,
permanentvacationist,239430,"I""ve stayed in this family run hostal for a night (well, i""ve stayed here for 2 times for a week in last 3 years). the renovation of the building is finished and it looks really great. the hostal flats are also quite new and clean. the room that i""ve got for big enough for me and was silent since it was facing interior. in a city like Madrid, you would only visit your room for sleeping! i supposed that rooms facing the reception desk can be bit noisy in the day time. the computers in the rooms are really retro and useful, or you can just plug ethernet cable to your laptop/netbook and go! you can ask for a longer ethernet cable (or bring your owns) if you want to use it in your bed. well, this is totally free internet service that we've just missed in other hotels. the price is quite good for equivalent places, and the people are very warm. there is small shop for food/water/beer downstairs as well as nice and small restaurant with 9 euro menus for lunchs. if you are into contemporary art just next building is a nice gallery. if you are into romanticism, there is a museum of romanticism just across the street. the hostal is just between chueca district (horteleza) & fuencarral shopping street and very close to tribunal metro station. 5-10 minutes to gran via however walking through the calle fuencarral makes it longer because of the nice shops on the way. drawbacks of the place (not really for me) is there is no elevator and rooms are on 2nd & 3rd floor. i love the sweet sound of the wooden stairs. i stayed a week in this hotel around christmas time, and i've upgraded to executive room. well, with the upgrade i got free internet (it's a shame since you need to pay for that slow internet if you are not staying in executive floor) and executive lounge (well, at least you can have express reception without any hassle). and well, room in higher floor, which is nice. swimming pool and spa facilities are great, but i can not say the same for the breakfast service. the biggest drawback was terrible executive lounge; poorly designed, poorly served with poorquality food. they should make something for this, immediately. otherwise you pay for nothing. Yet another one was the internet connection; ythe signal was so poor since i have to connect only with a laptop through ethernet cable (and boradband connection was not really boradband). the staff is very friendly and helpful, everybody was so kind (froom room service to concierge. the espresso machine is the room was the best Ä±option for me since i am a coffee lover. beyond this; if you are staying in singapore for business, it's perfect since it's just between usiness area and center. but for toustic visit: forget singapore. very well located big boutique hotel with very very small rooms. unfortunately, you can stay in a room without any window, but beside this you would be lucky if you can walk around your bed without hitting any object. the concept and the design seem nice and catchy in the lobby, there is even nice bar. but i can not say the same about room since the furnitures seem kitch and tacky.","My family of 4 (2 were young adults) stayed at Benamar for three days, Dec. 25-28 and were very happy with this place. Very close to the metro, easy to get to from airport. We had two doubles with private bathroom and balconies facing the street. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. JosÃ© MartÃ­n and his wife were very friendly and helpful when we had questions regarding internet access and directions. At the time we were there, JosÃ© MartÃ­n hadn't gotten WiFi (they were getting it a week from dates we were there) so we had a dated computer, but were able to connect to internet most of the time. The only negatives are the thin walls - we could hear our kids next door, and there are no elevators - you'll have to carry luggage up four flights of stairs. Would recommend Benamar for the value, safe and clean rooms and location. I could not mention any reasonable fault with our stay in this hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is minutes away from Tribunal metro -though you can easily walk onto the Gran Via and Old Madrid from here. My single room, though on the small side, was comfortable and cleaned everyday. My friend's room had a balcony, was spacious and even had a computer for personal use. At 37 euros a night - you'd be daft to stay anywhere else. No regrets whatsoever - just do it!

My girlfriend and I went to Spain last week and stayed for 3 nights at Hostal Benamar. The owners are a couple. Both of them are super friendly and helpful. The location is excellent. It's between two metro stops ""Tribunal"" and ""Alonso Martinez"", and equally close to either one. ""Tribunal"" if the only stop in the entire metro system which gets you to all 3 major train stations (Atocha, Principe Pio, and Chamartin) with direct train. You also need to transfer only once to get to the airport. The hostel is located on the 2nd and 3rd fl. (which equals to the 3rd and 4th fl. in the U.S.). At our arrival we were so tired and of course frustrated to find that there's no elevator in the building. Jose found me upstairs alone with no luggage and understood our difficulty immediately without me speaking out anything. He ran downstairs right away and carried all the bags for us. The room is clean is spacious -much bigger than any hotel rooms we stayed in other cities in Spain. The bathroom is in the same good condition. The only shortage, if I have to come up with one, would be the thin walls. During our first-night stay, there were loud guests in other rooms. However the second and the third night were perfect. Overall this is an unbeatable value compared with what we paid for hotel rooms. We spent almost double for our hotel room in Barcelona for the same length of stay. Spent three weeks here and would definitely recommend it for the price. The owner was fantastic and was always very accommodating and ready to answer any questions. It's not a five star hotel by any means but you more than get what you pay for. The location is also very good, lots of nightlife and decent restaurants nearby.",,,
Jan_Bruns,304826,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights in July when we went to the U2 concert in Berlin last year. While the Park Inn Berlin West is not the most central hotel, its located in a residential area, its still located very close to U-bahn (Metro) and the famous KurfÃ¼rstendam street (15 min walk). In the immediate surroundings there are some restaurants, but nothing much else. As for the hotel, it has a pretty big parking garage, and a nice clean reception. The people in the reception where very nice and helpful regarding the few questions we had. The rooms where ok sized, and very comfy. I would at any time recommend staying at this hotel, especially if you want to stay off the beaten path, and enjoy some quiet surroundings. As for the U2 concert, that was simply brilliant, best concert ever :) The Hesperia hotel, is placed in central Barcelona, its only a 10-15 minutte walk away from the Sagrada Familia, and less than 5 minuttes from the nearest subway station. From our window on the 5th floor we could actually see the top of the Sagrada Familia. There are a few restaurants and bars in the immidiate area, but I would advice to travel a bit closer to the center of town for eating. We had breakfast at the hotel, and this was ok, with one exception: The bacon tasted as if it was cooked. But compared to the general none exsistence of breakfast in Spain, i'd defenatly recommend bying at the hotel. Our room was quite small, there was only room, for a small desk, a minibar and our bed. The bathroom was ok in size. And who stays at the hotelroom for anything else than sleeping anyway ? The room where somewhat worn. The staff spoke excellent english, and where very friendly and helpfull. I'd recommend staying at this hotel anytime. Stayed at the Mim hotel, as I had eye surgery in the Istanbul Surgery hospital, located right next door. So when compared to this the location was excellent, but otherwise it was not good. One night we where at a soccer game, where Turkey played Hungary, we decided to walk back as we could not get a taxi. When we got close to the hotel we meet several groups of young Turks, who we asked for directions, the all recommended that we took a taxi, as it qoute 'was a bad neighboorhood'. The hotel is located on a very steep road, there are no restaurants near by, but there is a pizza place right across the street, alcohol is served at the hotel. If you want a taxi you have to got the the main road near by, and hope that you can catch one (usually not a problem). So the surroundings are not to good, the htel it self is rather nice though, its maintained quite good, the rooms are very nice, the staff is usually very helpful, I recommend the hotel if you have to go to the hospital, if you just want to visit Istanbul you should find somewhere else to stay. Not much to say, brilliant location near Sidney Habour. Nice big rooms, with very comfy beds. Had that 5 star feel, that it should have. Only two minor hickups was the fact that you had to pay for internet access and one to too service minded staff member, but nothing that spoiled the experience. One of the few hotels I have stayed at that I give a rating of five.","It'a very nice hotel, with very rich breakfast and large rooms. The only problem is that you have to cross the city and some times you loose some time on your way there. My wife and stayed at this property which was designated as the conference hotel. The conference was organized by Marmara University and the location was convenient. Check in was seamless as we had already reserved on line through the conference web site. We were taken to a corner 'suite' which was at best a small room with no suite in sight. The room had a coffee maker and a double bed which was pretty average in terms of comfort. The next morning we went downstairs to breakfast served buffet style. Very average offerings of cheese, butter, some jams, and honey, two kinds of bread and coffee or tea. The next morning my wÃÂ±fe supplanted the bread basket with a few awesome fresh simits from the simit vendor outside. And management added some fruits to the breakfast offerings. The next night we had trouble sleeping as the young people next door kept talking loudly which sounded like they were inside our room because the walls were paper thin. After I requested that they tone it down they complied only to repeat the act the next night. When we asked the front office people next morning to move us to a quiet room they moved the young people instead!!! Check out was a stressful experience as they wanted to charge us 120 Euro per night when the conference rate was 80 Euro. This for a hotel that we rate as 60 Euros, at best. Eventually the conference chairperson was involved and after back and forth telephone calls between the front office people and top management we were given a discount down to 90 Euro per night. They said this was a goodwill gesture. So the bottom line: There are much better hotels in Istanbul for that price but we really liked the staff. Stayed at the Mim hotel, as I had eye surgery in the Istanbul Surgery hospital, located right next door. So when compared to this the location was excellent, but otherwise it was not good. One night we where at a soccer game, where Turkey played Hungary, we decided to walk back as we could not get a taxi.

Reza Z,617024,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. staffs' behavior was not very friendly. The location is good and hotel's rooms are clean. The food in my opinion was below average, choices were very limited and I didn't find it tasty. The main negative point for this hotel is nightclub. at night there are many girls in the lobby and I don't consider it suitable for families. I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. There are many problems due to change of management of this hotel. As I have been told, personnels are not paid so most of them are not helpful. Breakfast and lunch are tasetless with limited choices. Most of the restaurant mentioned in their website are closed. There is a night club which plays music loud. At the chekout they wanted to charge us 92 Dhr for mini bar while we never used it. We talked to another person and he didn't ask anybody to check our minibar and we checked out. I think there is no clear rule in this hotel and staff request charges as they want. The only positive point about this hotel is that it is clean. The location is far from deira and you have long distance to restaurant or shopping centers in deira. I think you can easily find a 4 star hotel in the deira with better services and price","Delmon is located in Deira downtown locked with buildings and with limited access. Hotel is rated 4* but in my opinion do not deserve more than 3 plus. When we enter in the hotel we find small lobby and friendly staff. Check in was fast and we find our suite very nice and spacious. Bathroom was also big and filled with high class amenities. There is a night club in the hotel and a lot of nigh ladies but they are quiet and do not desturb anyone. Breakfast was disaster.It is better to take it at another place. I do not recommend this place if you want to visit Dubai. Better try with Bur Dubai hotels in Mankhool.

The main negative point for this hotel is nightclub. at night there are many girls in the lobby and I don't consider it suitable for families. not decent environment rude senior stuff not for family with children Not recomended We stayed at Delmon for 3 nights which was okay. We used the Free Airport Pick Up/Drop Off Service and it was good. The Rooms are okay but maybe need a Upgrade but really enjoyed the Free Internet. The Food was not the best we had Breakfast which was good for my Partner but not for me. The Pool Area is pretty small and the Bar is so overprized. Only good thing up there is u can watch the planes starting and landing at the Airport :). Was a bit disappointed with the LOUD Music from the Bar. Location is good not far from the Clock Tower and quick ride with the Taxi to the Shopping Mall or Beach. Great Hortel in good location - but with very small swimming pool ... and prices at the BAR close to pool - VERY HIGH I pay around 5$ for one can of coca cola - the same price for small beer ..... what is more we were taking small botels of water from mini bar- hotel was counting that every day and in the end of our stay we pay extra money for it :) - hehehhehe anyway - Great Hotel in Good Price .... Was pleasantly surprised after reading some negative reviews of this hotel. We stayed two nights before going on a cruise and one night after the cruise. We phoned the hotel from home and asked if we could be collected from the airport and this service was provided free of charge. All staff were polite and friendly and happy to answer any questions about places we wanted to visit, how to get there etc. The room was spacious and clean and bed very very comfy. Bathroom also in good shape. When we returned from our cruise we were given a junior suite which was absolutely fantastic after being stuck in a tiny cabin for a week - pity we had to leave at 4.00 am next morning. The pool area is not great but it is somewhere to sit and enjoy the last bit of sunshine at the end of the day with a cool drink. The staff there are very helpful too.We were returned to the aiport free of charge in good time for our flight. Cannot commnet on the food as we did not eat there. I would use the hotel again. What a total nightmare, our room was above the nightclub which was open until 3am, we had no hot water, and the pool area was disgusting. Do not ever stay here!! The staff were most helpful but we felt they had an uphill battle on their hands. An old hotel with few facilities except for the Disco which we could hear on the third floor. Fortunately it finished at 3.00.a.m. giving us a few hours rest. The breakfast cost â¬7 for a coffee and bun. We stayed two nights before joining a cruise, and were thankful to leave the place.",,,
alXpucu,564758,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in March 2011 and for sightseeing - the nearest metro station is just a few minutes' walk away and the main palza is probably a 30-min walk from the hotel. The location of a shopping centre literally across from the hotel was also a plus. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel and preferred the cafes at the shopping centre instead. The hotel itself was a very good value for money - we managed to book a 2 for 3 nights deal that they offer on weekdays. General cleanliness was excellent, and so were the rooms - exactly as in the pictures on the website. The nice view from the rooftop pool is also and added benefit - even though it's only open for use in the summer. Staff were really helpful and friendly and we really had no issues with the hotel so would recommend! We stayed at the hostel for 3 nights in the summer and frankly were pleasantly surprised with this hostel, especially since at this price we didn't expect much. We requested two rooms as we were a party of 3 guys and 5 girls and this couldn't have worked out better as we were accommodated in a flat with two rooms, bathroom and a kitchen just to ourselves. Obviously, if we were to share the flat with other tourists the experience would not have been the same, but for us it worked out pretty well. In terms of the actual facilities the place was basic, but we had everything we needed. Towels were provided although at an additional charge, there were basic toiletries in the bathroom and there was simple breakfast (biscuits and croissants) provided every morning. The coffee making facilities and the ability to prepare our own snacks in the kitchen was also a plus. I remember, however, that we had some difficulty locating the place - I think there are two buildings under the same hostel name - they are both managed by the same staff but can be a bit confusing so make sure you double check on the phone where you're meant to be going. Our flat was in a block of flats - I even got the impression not all of them were being rented out to tourists so it felt a little bit like living in a residential place but we didn't mind, however, this may be a downside for those travellers looking to meet other people. In terms of the location it was excellent only a few minutes' walk away from the Termini station, the tube and all the shops in the vicinity. Staff were also very helpful and polite with better than the average( for Italy) English (which proved useful when the fuse switch tripped and we had troubles locating the fusebox!). All in all I would recommend this place as ideal for groups of friends and young travellers looking for budget accommodation in the very heart of Rome.","We stayed at the hostel for 3 nights in the summer and frankly were pleasantly surprised with this hostel, especially since at this price we didn't expect much.

Convenient location, secure too (you need quite a few keys to get in!). Hostel was very clean, a lot cleaner than some upmarket hotels. Diana - the manager was very friendly and helpful and always asked if everything was OK (something big hotels could learn from). There was good heating too. The road outside could be a bit noisy but there was a double glazed window which blanked out most of the noise. Breakfast small but this is normal for Italy so not an issue. Good value, highly recommended! I booked a room there - but i can't really rate my stay, since i just couldn't get in. I told them i would be there at a precise time in the evening, and i kept ringing for hours. No one opened the doors for me, so i had to find another place to stay - which wasnt easy, considering how late it already was. What really upset me is that i couldnt even get a refund, because the owner of the hotel refused to admit he wasn't there that day, but mostly because he said he called me to know what i was. He never called me, and therefore i never answered his hypothetical phone call. These people are unprofessional and liars.",,,

We had to share the bathroom and it was not clean. They didn't have the elevator, so it was really hard to bring the big baggage to upstairs. When we asked the staff to bring up the baggage, they told us to pay for that. The room was really small. We even couldn't open the baggage on the floor, so we had to opened it on the bed. The bed was not confortable at all. The bed cover was too small for the bed. I strongly recommend not to stay there. As the previous reviewer wrote, yes, the bed is hard, no window, tiny room, however - if you plan to pretty much only sleep in your room, this is an excellent choice. Excellent Chinatown/Little Italy location. Close to great shopping on Canal/Broadway. Easy subway access to all other points! Friendly staff. Secure main entrance. Free WiFi! Read over other reviews with interest both before and after - old buildings should not be confused with dirty. This was quite clean.

I stayed at this hotel for 1 night. (I was on a Business Trip in NY) I did not check any reviews before booking as I didn't have time for it. The hotel is really horrifying. The rooms are so small!!! The furniture is old. The smell is bad. I supposed to stay longer in this hotel, but I could not sleep there so I booked another hotel. I stayed here for one night after going to see a show in the city. My partner did not check any reviews before booking and thought the hotel would be cheap but decent. It was horrifying. It's not that the rooms are small, it goes so beyond that. They are old and filthy and not really hotels rooms at all but little box rooms with no windows and box springs as beds. The whole place smelled so gross and the thin walls forced you to hear everything going on in the neighboring rooms and hallway, which was really disgusting at two in the morning!!! Take this review seriously because when we saw the room, we both wanted to cry. We walked down to the Best Western, two blocks away and begged for a room but they were all booked. STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! I booked a budget hotel in New York and was prepared for basic and am happy with simple but the thing that got me with this hotel was the open ceiling - a grill covered by a door mat had been placed in an attempt to minimise the impact to the unsuspecting traveller that you are sharing your room with a family who live directly above. Apart from the noise (from the family above and from the neighbours due to the paper thin walls), the lack of windows and the noisy air conditioning did not make for a decent nights sleep. I booked 2 nights but decided to abandon the second night - surely a sign of how bad this place is. I also would not describe my room or the bathrooms as particularly clean - though the bedding did smell of bleach which I actually found very reassuring! Don't go there! The room are small, very dirty e noisy. The bed was dirty and as comfortable as to sleep on a piece of wood. The bathroom and some towel were dirty too. It's a cheap hotel but to sleep in these condition it's very expensive! My experience there was in the middle from a joke and a nightmare!",,,
BillyMaysHere,114079,"This inn was absolutely charming and furnished with period furnature (ca late 1930's). The location is perfect, the charm is wonderful. A word of warning, the front desk is only open betwixt 11AM and 7PM, but that should not be a problem. Lovely balconies provide a great oppertunity to sit outside and enjoy the sea air whilst watching the tourists walk by. Great hotel, and an outstanding value. Even though I stayed in the Gilligan's Island part of the hotel (a ten minute walk to the beach/pool/lobby), I was afforded a georgous oceanview room with a view of the ocean and nothing else. Absolutely luxuriously appointed and spacous room. For the money, one of the values on West Maui","Rooms need updating, everything was awesome. This trip actually happened in April 2001 This inn was absolutely charming and furnished with period furnature (ca late 1930's). The location is perfect, the charm is wonderful.

Lovely balconies provide a great oppertunity to sit outside and enjoy the sea air whilst watching the tourists walk by. Great hotel, and an outstanding value. If you're looking for a hotel in the centre of town, that is noisy, this is for you. Location is good. Otherwise staff don't care (particularly management when I complained about the noise). I wouldn't stay here again. Rooms are small, but clean and nicely furnished. The building has character, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable, but also small for two people. The location is extremely convenient. The hotel was quiet and the street noise not bad either, until a garbage truck came through early in the morning. We passed a comfortable and restful night, but for a longer visit, one might want a larger room. Be aware that Internet access is not free: there is a $10 charge per day. This is a cozy little Inn.. I booked day of on a third party website and was given a room here. Its located right in the downtown Lahaina area. Its associated with the Royal Lahaina Resort. There is complementary tea and coffee stand in the lobby. This Inn does not have elevator access so if you cant deal with dragging luggage up a stair case, you might want to go somewhere else, otherwise its only one flight and not much trouble. Parking is available up the street in a large parking lot. Has a restaurant and bar attached to it. The rooms are cozy and clean. The beds are a bit small but still comfortable. We attempted to sleep through the night in one bed, however ended up giving up and each sleeping in one. (room had 2 beds) The room had a nice balcony. I would stay at this property again, would recommend to someone looking for a great find on a low budget. It is like one of those old family run European hotels with lots of old stuff, quaint decor, tiny rooms, etc.... but there is no family there. In fact, there was no staff of any kind most of the day. The desk clerk/manager left at 5 pm (the sign says the desk is staffed from 11am to 7 pm... go figure). So there was nobody to ask questions of. Finding the included parking was like a treasure hunt without a map, and parking is about a block away. I made my reservation for the Ocean Front Room with Economy Car deal. First, there are no ocean front rooms... you go out on your balcony, look right, and the ocean is a block away. Second, there was a screwup between the hotel and Dollar Rent A Car (and I may have done something wrong... there wasn't anybody to ask), so I ended up paying twice for my car... once to the hotel and once to Dollar. The person who answers the phone at customer service did not understand (or refused to understand) that there was any problem with that. The hotel is in the heart of Lahaina, a plus. But that means it is noisy until quite late. The rooms are very small, no closet, just two hooks on the wall. The double bed, a big pot plant, and a tall dresser take up most of the space in the room, not even a chair to sit on. The little deck was nice for two people to sit. The bathroom has a small shower, toilet, and small sink. It was clean though worn, and the bed was comfortable. Me and my wife stayed at Lahaina Inn for 1 night. I enjoyed the oldness and uniqueness it provided. You are walking distance from the Lahaina strip where we spent most of our time in Maui any way. The price was alot better than $4500 a week at Honua Kai. If I was to return to Maui, I will definitely not over do it with the housing. We used the expensive hotel to eat, sleep, and take a dump. I can do that at Lahaina Inn and it 10X cheaper. You in Maui!!! Who care where you are staying, outside is way better than inside. Lahaina Inn change our way of thinking about these over priced hotels. Love it. This is a great location for things happening downtown: shopping, eating, and boating trips. It can be noisy from 10:30pm til 1:00am because of people partying in the parking lot behind the hotel. And again the noise starts at 6:00am with the garbage trucks and the leaf blowers cleaning the in the parking lot. Your really don't need the sleep because there are so many fun things to do away from the hotel and nothing to do at the hotel other than sleep. This was our 4th stay, but first since ownership changed, and will be our last time. There have been renovations, and for us the only upside of that was a nice redo on a bathroom. The downsides are plentiful. No closet in the room (#5), one dresser that was so mildewed that you could smell it coming into the room, so we had to live out of suitcases and hanging clothes on a hook on the wall. The room had no chair to sit in, no lighting except the overhead. Even the common area that was a nice feature in the past was gone, so no fridge to keep items in, no lounging area, no breakfast snacks, no board game area. The Lahaina Inn would be better described now as a fancy youth hostel, not a place to relax. Save your money, there are much better choices in Lahaina for less than what this place charges. We love this place! Very laid back and friendly. We are not ""high maintainence"" guests, so this was perfect for us. Not for you if you expect someone to be at your beck and call. No ice machine, soda machine, etc, but a truly beautiful place. We would not hesitate to stay again. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few days in November, for $70 including tax you cannot go wrong. Going from a hostel room to a beautiful suite with a porch and a private washroom for $15 more with beautiful furniture... it was a dream come true! We knew for that price something had to be wrong with it and the next morning we discovered it was the noise in the morning, it starts at about 7:30 - 8 am and wakes you up for sure. So if you are looking to sleep in past 8 this place is not for you. If you're an early riser, THIS IS A TOTAL STEAL OF A ROOM. We are so lucky to have found such a beautiful room at this price. The best part about this place: Location & price. It's reasonably clean... could be cleaner though. There's that smell that old hotels tend to have. It was our first stop in our honeymoon, and we were jet-lagged. Hawaii is about 5 hours before us. So we had a hard time enough sleeping, without the really loud garbage truck in the morning. And we paid for the upgrade to get the ocean view. The noise is about 30 mins to 1 hour long. When I read the reviews online, I knew it was small, and I knew a garbage truck made noise in the morning. But I didn't realize it was that loud. You're there on your vacation. Sleep and rest are important. The noise is a deal-breaker, I will not be back to the Lahaina Inn. cozy atomosphere, excellent location. small inn, 12 rooms and 2 suites i think. there's no in room tv available. but there's a lounge equipped with kitchen equipments (microwave oven, water dispenser, coffee maker, frige...etc) tv is there too. very helpful and friendly staff. great location.. the hotel is literally 2 mins away from front street. shopping center is 5 mins walk. there's a restaurant right downstairs "" Lahaina Grill "" (award winning joint), too bad we we kep t on missing trying it out. restaurant hours 6pm-10pm. We got a recommendation from Lonely Planet to stay at this old inn. It was quaint and clean. The bedroom was small but neat, we were only staying one night, so it was pretty trouble free. We heard nothing of other guests, so that was a bonus too. The trouble was, we heard the gentle roar of an air conditioner. I had broken sleep all night. I dont know exactly where it came from, but I suspect it was the air conditioners underneath and next door. So if you are a heavy sleeper, it is great. If you are a light sleeper, check the room out before you commit to it. Our room faced away from the street. Me and my husband spend one night in this Inn. The Inn is centrally located, easy access to everything. The room is a small one and with wodnerful antique furnishings plus with a nice ocean view balcony. Not easy to find a ""free"" parking in Lahaina and we even have problem to unload our baggage near the hotel. Highly recommand to park by where the Inn suggest you and its closer and not expensive. One small note, as the Inn located in the city centre and close to serveral bars, we did woke up by some drunk people scream at mid night and some big lorry parking/ loading in early morning.",,,

Stayed here for 9 nights for over $100 a night, cheapest hotel i could find that wasn't a dump, so I thought while booking it. The service while checking in was descent , no type of extra effort from staff to make me feel comfertable. My room wasn't ready yet so I was told to leave my bags and relax ! no apology or anything . I guess it was my fault for coming an hour early. There was an Asian lady who worked working the breakfast buffet who was more concerned about my room number instead of seating me ! I guess she assumed I was trying to sneak a free breakfast out of the deal , , yea bcuz thats what I like to do , trave half way around the world , book a hotel for over $100 a night and trick my way into a free breakfast ! ! ! I didn't like her customer service skills need less to say . Overall The room was too smal for its price and there's no staff downstars past midnight. so If you need anything past that you're on your own. The location was ok if you don't mind riding the train for a few Euros to the city center. I wouldn't stay here again !

It was finally my turn and I approach my counter, older staff member behind the counter greeted me while blowing his nose! ! ! Thats exactly how I like being greeted while checking into my $150 plus a night hotel. At least he didnât offer to shake my hand. He then asked for my email address, I assumed it was for booking verification process so I gave it to him, I've been getting JUNK MAIL from MGM to this day ! ! !

Good location, good rooms. May be not very clear but it's cos hotel not very new. Nice Location , everything is close by ( Metro ( Train station ), Shops , Food Places We were on 6th floor and it was new floor , room was nice & comfortable with all facilities . yes hotel have 2 clubs and guests on other or lower floors may get disturbed by noise but we were fine.good value for money and yes staff was helpful. This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life. Firstly they took a blocking from my card and assured me it would be cancelled once we checked out. Once I returned home I noticed they had deducted the funds form my account. That was 2 months ago and they are refusing to do anything about it. The hotel is an absolute disgrace all round. They have 3 or 4 night clubs going on until 4 in the morning. The hotel has 6 floors of rooms - unless you are on the 6th floor at the back of the hotel you will not be able to sleep due to the sound of the nightclubs. The staff and particularly the hotel manager were rude and aggressive to my wife. The breakfast buffet was terrible and the rooms and sheets filthy. I would strongly recomend to avoid this hotel at all costs. I had 2 day trip in the Dubai city and we booked this hotel because it's located in the good area, but when we arrived here our vision to this hotel has been changed. at 3 am there was many people running inside the hotel walking, laughing, kissing and so on. I think theses 2 night clubs must be closed if the hotel management want to change the image, otherwise it is house of prostitution. I never have high expectations of the Hotel I am staying in, always the minimum basic facilities satisfy me ! ... but in this hotel nothing was the way i was expecting ... maybe the only good thing about this hotel is its location which is 5 min walk from metro station that there are many other hotels nearby with same advantage ... with the same amount of money that I paid to this hotel I could stay in much better hotels in Dubai ... our room was in first floor where you could hear noises of Arabic night club till 3 am! and sometimes it was immpossible to sleep! ... no slippers in the room or bathroom ... there was no safe .... internet connection was not wireless although it was free ... and the worst thing was the food , breakfast and lunch were in very low standards and you had not many choices at breakfast and lunch time ... door keys ( cards ) always had problems and every day they had to re-programm it so we could enter our room ... for two days they had left some wet sheets on the ground in front of your room for unknown reason! ... 90 percent of hotel residents were Iranians who didnt complain to any of this insufficienies ... I certainly do not recommend this hotel ... with the same money you can find much better deals ... there are two night clubs at the hotel , African and Arabic ... and also there is a pool bar at the roof ... serving drinks and hooka and Billiard! ... non of them were in good standards We were diverted here from Heathrow when the airport was shut. The staff did not communicate with us upon check in and were very rude when were were checking out. As much as a room is nice you always remember the service. I was in Sun & Sand on last dubai shopping festival. Actually a travel agency recommended the hotel and it was the first time that I trusted in a travel agency to select a proper hotel for me, and undoubtedly it will be the last time! I don't know where to start. The staff was very impolite. The receptionist treated me like a prisoner instead of a guest! The room was dirty and the water was freezing and when I called the maintenance to check it, they came to my room after 1 hour! After calling room service, the soonest possible time to have a drink in your room was 45 minutes. The room service was terrible. I asked three times for a shampoo and lotion! They didnât clean the room daily even when I asked them. The food wasnât good either (breakfast was ok). Rooms were damp and a bit smelly. Staff was polite especially the ones in the buffet were very kind and helpful. ALL the guests were Iranian; actually it was like an Iranian restaurant with rooms .the hotel had a free transfer service to the nearby mamzar beach which was very good. But afterall I wouldnât recommend it at all. my family and me spent 5 days in this hotel. room and bathroom were clean. staff were very polite and kind. food in restaurant was delicious and different. only my room refrigeratory doesnot work but after one day! is repaired . totally a good hotel.",,,
raff40035,199436,"Stayed for 2 nights whilst attending a conference, Modern, funky rooms with excellent food. I flew into Tegel, which is quite a distance away. However when the new Brandenberg airport opens in June it will be much closer. It is however still a distance away from the city centre. The hotel has a lovely location at the confluence of the Damme and Spree and opposite the Kopenick Castle. OK if you are on buisness , but if on a city visit its perhaps too far out of the centre. Have stayed in Paris several times and always look for a reasonably priced hotel. I have to say this was the best I HAVE FOUND SO FAR. The location was excellent situated 5 mins walk from the lively Bastille and Marais districts. Room was comfartable and well equipped with a fantastic shower (Room 401) Blackout curtains meant a fantastic nights sleep. It's only a 5 - 10 minute walk from Gare de Lyon station which was handy for our early morning TGV to Avignon in the morning. We hope to be back next year Have stayed in Paris several times and always look for a reasonably priced hotel. I have to say this was the best I HAVE FOUND SO FAR. The location was excellent situated 5 mins walk from the lively Bastille and Marais districts.

We hope to be back next year","The Penta Hotel Berlin KÃ¶penick is situated directly on the river Spree. There is a small marina directly ""next door"". Rather quiet, not much traffic noise. The house is clean and the personel friendly. If you don't mind them wearing jeans at work you have a hotel with all you need to feel comfortable. Stayed for 2 nights whilst attending a conference, Modern, funky rooms with excellent food. I flew into Tegel, which is quite a distance away. However when the new Brandenberg airport opens in June it will be much closer. It is however still a distance away from the city centre. The hotel has a lovely location at the confluence of the Damme and Spree and opposite the Kopenick Castle. OK if you are on buisness , but if on a city visit its perhaps too far out of the centre. This hotel is the perfect example what a total refurbishment can do to an old 80s building. The interior designer did an outstanding job and you can see that money was not spared. There are only 2 places you see that this is an old building. The elevator is still from the medieval times and the bathrooms look outdated. The hotel is a 4 star. The rooms are ok. No mini-bar thou so I would argue a bit with a 4 star rating here. the breakfast is AMAZING. German breakfasts in general are very good but this one is SUPERB. The lobby is so nice that actually hanging around there is fun in the evening. Prices are LOW Location is not the best. Its close to Schonefeld, the future BBI airport that will open in the summer. Its a nice area thou but surely not useful if you wanna visit berlin for a few days. I stayed at this place for 3 nights, it is a great place to stay and you can get into Berlin very easily on tram 68 and then then S bahn from Kopenick. If I could give 10 stars I would, the rooms and hotel decor have all been re vamped. It is really trendy and modern. ( they even have free Wii in the bar area) who ever is responsiblefor the refit of this hotel deserves major credit. It is amazing believe me and could not believe the value. Everything about this place is totally brilliant including the staff. If you are going to Berlin stay here, you will not be dissapointed and I will definately return Any questions please ask.",,,

They were so loud they woke us up and just got louder, we kept complaining to the front desk, the lady said they would look into it and ask them to be quieter.

Finally we got to sleep again almost 3 am because the party was so loud the police had to came to make them leave. They must have thought they were the only ones staying there or something. So rude! Checked into the hotel late. Called prior to let them know we were going to be late, once we arrived the HORRIBLE experience started immediately. The night audit employee was making discrimination comments about our group before we even entered our rooms. At about 2:30 a.m. we were woken up by the police stating that we have to leave the hotel due to noise complaints. The cops had to go to the front desk and question which rooms were being noisy because they could not hear anything. Yes, once we arrived at the hotel and all were adjusted we met in one of the three rooms and talked and drank some beers for a couple of hours. But by the time the cops were called we were all in our own rooms and sleeping. Not a fun way to be woken up and then told you have to leave the hotel. When we arrived late there may have been about 10 minutes of noise for us to unload and carry things to our rooms. But since we were on the 2nd floor and the DON""T have an elevator we had to make several trips up the stairs for 10 people, but after that it was not out of control at any point. Not Recommended - BAD CHOICE to stay here. Needless to say the cops were not surprised.",,,
TexShel,91477,"I booked through expedia my entire trip. This seemed to be the worst part. When we checked in they did not ask for ID or anything, just told them our name and they gave us a paper to sign in. There was local police sitting in the parking lot going through the hotel register of guests, kind of creepy! Guessing there is someone they were looking for? The room had a funky smell. It was HOT in there, the A/C did not work. There was a coffee pot, but no coffee making things. No cups for water. There was one of the ladies that works at the desk walking around eating all 3 times I seen her! I do want to note that the public area where the pool and sitting area was very pretty. I am sure pets are allowed because there were many barking dogs and cats in many of the windows I had a nice stay. The hotel was bundled in a pakage with flight and car. The rooms were clean and the walkways (halls) were clean. My only problem was the vending machines were all non-working.","What do you expect from a 2-star hotel? It was clean, staff was friendly and the breakfast, though minimal, was fresh. You can't beat the price if you're not looking for fancy. Yes, the bathroom is tiny but it serves its purpose. The pool was clean and not too cold. Didn't get to view the hottub as it was full during our stay. Had no trouble getting extra towels when requested. I would stay there again. Starting off I want to say: I booked this hotel through priceline.com for the indoor heated pool, hot tub, and gym. It was a routine weekend stay in Indianapolis for me from a Friday night to a Sunday morning. I was not made aware that the gym closed at 10pm leaving me only 20 minutes (at best) to do anything before the deadline. The pool towels are held hostage at the front desk so be sure to grab some before jumping in otherwise you will be soaked and freezing through the unheated glass encased breezeway that connects the poolroom to the hotel. I never got to enjoy the pool or hot tub anyway since the hotel was so insanely over crowded compared to the facilities available. The free breakfast is non-existent unless you get out there on the double, by 9:20am everything is gone (save a lone brand muffin) and the cleanup crew is working diligently. The main hallway stinks of mildew and the carpet visibly needs replaced. On the day of checkout (9:30am) the maid knocked twice very quickly and was halfway in my room through the locked door before I yelled 'hello' and she retreated apologetically. I had a nice stay. The hotel was bundled in a pakage with flight and car. The rooms were clean and the walkways (halls) were clean. My only problem was the vending machines were all non-working. We stayed at the Days Inn for just one night while visiting the Children's Museum. We were on a tight budget for this trip, so I was a little concerned about the caliber of hotels we would find in our price range - particularly because we were traveling with our three children (ages 6 and under). I chose this hotel because of the good reviews it seemed to get, despite the price range. I was very pleased with the quality we found here! The hotel is in a shopping area with several dining options nearby. The staff was very friendly. The hotel could use some updating in terms of carpeting and general decor, but the room itself was nicely furnished and a good size. The pool area was very clean. The free breakfast they offer is much more than your typical dry cereal and coffee - they offer a variety, including Belgian waffles, fruit, pastries, etc. For the price we paid for this hotel, I expected much, much less. It certainly doesn't offer scenic views or deluxe amenities. But if you're looking for a place to stop for the night that's clean, safe and acceptable for sleeping at a low price, this is a great option. First floor very dirty especially dirty, carpets smelled very bad. Pool water not clean. Housekeeping failed to clean room within five hours. Breakfeast area not well maintained. Treated very poorly by front desk staff. ""King Valued Room"" with AAA discount & tax under $50 with BIG room, couch, nice big table for laptop & papers, decent BIG tub-shower & tiled bath, wet-bar w cooler (that worked), and KING bed that slept great just off the interstate connections; sure it was 3-4 miles down 86th from the $189 high priced stuff near Keystone Crossings, but hey, got great food, dining, and snacks with money saved. Yes, the ceiling needed painting, but was not spending $25/hr to sleep either! Good value if ""regular"" people.",,,
Julie M Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler,208594,"I took my nephew to Barcelona as his 18th birthday present & this hotel was recommended to me. It was only a couple of minutes walk from the bus terminus/las ramblas & we got there very early. Fortunately our room was ready and they let us book in at 10.30am. The room was very nice and we had a little balcony that we sat out on. They even supplied 2 little travel bags of accessories in the bathroom that surprised me for a 1* hotel. We had our own fridge & outside in the hall was a computer that we could use free of charge. The staff were really friendly & helpful. The breakfast was ok, there was a fair selection. Although we didn't eat here (apart from breakfast), the restaurant was very busy during the day with non-residents so maybe worth looking into! Had a lovely stay at the Grand Hotel Amrath,great location and easy walk to most attractions. Room was lovely and spacious. Was an expensive stay for us but you get what you pay for. Would reccommened this hotel to anyone.","The location is very good. The traffic is very convenient, airport bus & metro.With buffet breakfast. The price is reasonable. The room is clean comfortably. There is free wi-fi & internet. The staff is nice and the cleaner staff is good service and very nice. Very recommed !

Although we didn't eat here (apart from breakfast), the restaurant was very busy during the day with non-residents so maybe worth looking into! the titel of the riveiw says it all Simple, quite good service, close to the center and the ramblas. Room cleaned every day but it coud be better, breakfast okay and enough. Value for your money. Good startingpoint for discovering barcelona. First time staying in a 1 star and we were very pleased. Checked in early and they stored our luggage. Desk clerk spoke good english. Asked for a quiet room and we got a room at the back and had no noise issues. Room had air con, electronic safe. and flat screen tv as well as two beds very comfortable decent size bathroom and lots of room for 4 suitcases. Breakfast was included in the room rate and the restaurant is attached to the hotel nice variety for breakfast excellent coffee with chocolate croissants and ham and cheese baguettes, juice, fruit,cereal one can eat inside or they have tables outside too which we utilized in the evening to people watch along with a few cold beers. We ate dinner at the restaurant on our first nite and it was very good and reasonably priced. Location is great close to Plaza Catalunya where you can buy a ticket on the hop on off buss which takes you to all the major attractions and also an easy walk to La Ramblas lots of great restaurants in the area as well. We went to Barcelona for the first time over New Years Eve (11/12). The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very adequate - with all the amenities you need for a short city break. The staff were also very polite and helpful. The best thing about this stay is when we got back to our room on New Years Eve a complimentary bottle of Champagne had been left in our room! :-) I spent sometime in this hotel and it was great! The staff are friendly . The room is very clean. The location is perfect, the breakfast is simple, but very good! You can stay there, its ok!!! I stayed in this hotel for two nights, three days. the location was central and easily walkable by Metro (which in Barcelona is excellent) from the airport you can take a shuttle which is cheap and maybe have to walk half a block and you're there. the front desk was nice he held our bags until check in so we could walk through the city before check-in. the rooms are clean and furnished, beds, TV's. the bathroom had towels, keep in mind this is a budget hotel, not everything matched but that's not important for me. breakfast is included which is in the bar/cafe next door. when returning to Barcelona i will be staying there again for sure. Barcelona was the third stop after Madrid and Ibiza on our 2010 trip to Spain and France. We are 3 couples in our 20s from Bombay. Hotel Urquinaona scores very highly thanks to its great location and friendly service. It is a block away from the Plaza Catalunya hub and 3 blocks from the cultural smorgaboard that's Las Ramblas. It is also just above a metro station - Urquinaona - which is connected to two lines. Special mention for the service - the desk and the staff at the restaurant next door (where we had breakfast on all four days) - are really sweet and helpful. The rooms and shower are comfortable and clean... although most of them don't have a great view. But who needs a view in Barcelona - the most delighful and vibrant city I've been to in Europe so far. There is free internet on a computer in the common area on the first floor. Enough number of eateries, pubs, shopping places and grocery stores nearby. Room 203 on the inner with 3 beds. Nice and clean, tv, fridge, aircondition, good beds. Not big, no great view, silent. We tried 301 with balcony on the streetside but impossible to sleep on friday saturday when a club over the street was noisy till 6 aÂ´clock. No problem to change back to 203. Breakfast with small and big sandwiches with ham, salami, cheese, croissant, sweet pastries, excellent coffee, juice, fresh fruit, cornflakes and choco. I donÂ´t need more. Excellent restaurant. Very helpful staff. Very priceworth. Very close to where all things happen at Placa Catalunya. The hotel reception staff were very pleasant however this did not extend to the bar/restaurant. The breakfast was extremeley poor and dumped on the end of the bar, the breakfast area was shabby whilst the restaurant at the rear of the hotel was empty. The bar waiter in the evening had a terrible attitude and refused to serve anyone after 11.30pm as he had better things to do and literally stood over a table of 4 who had spent the whole evening at this establishment until they finished their dinks and left. Our room was at the rear of the hotel and had no view apart from some brickwork, the room was dark and airless, the trains on the metro could be heard constantly. We normally stay in 3 or 4 star hotels but as we had a busy schedule and would be out of the hotel most of the time we thought things would not be too bad. They were and we soon moved on to another hotel. Myself and my family stayed for 3 nights. We had one or two problems during our stay and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful. The rooms were nice with flat screen tv(we listened to the radio rather than watch the tv). Two of our rooms had a lovely balcony as well. The real treat was the bathrooms which had a fantastic shower. All in all this hotel is in a good location, it's in a quiet area but within minutes of the Rambla and all the night life. The breakfast in the attached restaurant is also lovely and served til 11.30am. I'd highly recommend this hotel for a break in Barcelona. Fabulous location, walking to everything plus the Metro at your doorstep. Great value, even at height of season. Lovely room with balcony, modern bath and great shower, fridge, safe, breakfast included, free internet and computer in the lounge area. Desk staff were very helpful and could answer any question. Added plus of an excellent restaurant attached. A great boutique hotel, highly recommended. As I stayed in this hotel for my vacation with all my family, I would say that it' s such a comfortable hotel for many things. Because this hotel just renovated and it's mordern and very clean, In the room, it has safety box and flat screen television that usually the small hotel haven't offer this kinds of thing. Moreover, the restuarant in the hotel is very good and u can eat the real Spanish taste. The hotel is very close to the center area which u could go every attractive place or shopping area. I haven't got any problem about children during i'm stayed in this hotel, all staff is very kind. I could say this hotel is perfect to choose to stayed and i'm surely to come back to stay this hotel again. Hotel Urguinaona web site didn't look too promising and thus it was very very pleasant surprise. The staff was very nice, friendly and personal. Breakfast was good quality and relaxed and the room itself was really clean and stylish. I stayed at 501 (top floor) and I had really huge terrace in my room. Wow! The room itself is not that roomy but very ok for e.g. business travellers or people like me -- spending 4-5 days in Barcelona. It is located just a block from Plaza Catalynua (this is where airport bus will drop you). It is walking distance from Rambla, old town etc. The hotel is next to a park and rather quiet. I paid 59 euros per night and it definitely was worth the money. I booked this hotel for 12 girls on a hen weekend and wanted somewhere cheap & cheerful. I checked trip advisor prior to booking & thought It's not exactly modern or very well presented but its central! However..... We arrived and the whole place had just had a complete overhaul. It was bright, funky & modern. We had double & triple rooms booked and all were immaculate, beds made & towels changed daily, flat screen on the wall, electronic safe, extra blankets, air con and we were all presented with a rose on arrival! Breakfast was cereal, pastry O.J & coffee & fresh fruit. We used the bar attatched which was reasonable howver not the restaurant but the menu looked good & also well priced. The location is superb, less than a minuite to Urquinaona metro stop & 3 blocks walk to Placa Catalunya. The staff were friendly & welcoming. Ignore all old photos & check out the ones dated April 2010. Highly recomended if you want clean, central and cheap.",,,
jaardi,232606,"I visited Vancouver again this past Christmas (2011) and had the opportunity to stay at The Loden - and again, I was impressed. The front desk staff are helpful, friendly and efficient. It's on a bit of a sidestreet, though very conveniently located, so it's quite quiet. The rooms are very comfortable - the king-size bed with nice down pillows and a wonderful duvet. I was in a corner room and had windows on 2 sides - peek-a-boo views of the harbour and North Shore. The bathroom is a thing of beauty; full-size bath and separate shower and toilet. I love the Molton Brown amenities - if you've never tried their Warming Eucalyptus shower gel, you have no idea what you're missing! :-) I believe they've made some changes to the restaurant - though I'd not eaten there before. Breakfast was included in my rate, so I ate there each morning. The buffet is set up across the bar and seems to have everything you'd want (in a continental style - toast, pastries, juice and coffee and I think they were doing some sort of wrap for a hot breakfast). I enjoyed staying at the Loden and look forward to staying there again! This is the second time that I've stayed at the Loden. I love this hotel - it's small and on a quiet street, but close to everything in Vancouver. The staff is consistently friendly and professional. The room is large and luxurious, the bathroom is great - my only minor peeve is that the faucet and sink are designed so that there tends to be water all over the counter! But it sure looks good! Parking (other than the valet - which I didn't take advantage of) is always a challenge in downtown Vancouver. This hotel is very centrally located - I arrived by train at the Hauptbahnhof, which is only 2 stops away from Hackescher Markt S-bahn station and from there it's a short walk to the hotel. I was a little troubled when I saw the trams stopped in front of the hotel, but even though my room faced that street, it wasn't terribly noisy. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby and the Hackescher Hoefe shopping complex is just on the corner. Close to everything in Berlin. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast waitress was also very friendly. Breakfast was plentiful and varied. Nice hotel - I'll be back.","This hotel could hardly be bettered. Superb condition, friendly and helpful staff, excellent breakfast, ideal location This hotel is very close to the S-Bahn station, and easy to get to. It is also very close to the museum island, so this hotel is a very good place if you want to spend lots of time there. The room was not large by any means, but since I was travelling alone on business, it was more than enough. A huge plus was free wireless Internet. Some of the reviews were complaining about noise at night, but I had no problem. The elevator was unconventional, since you need to press the floor that you want to go to outside of the elevator. I only had breakfast once at the hotel because of the cost performance. If you are hungry, I would recommend it, but since I do not eat that much in the morning, it was overpriced for me.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast waitress was also very friendly. Breakfast was plentiful and varied. Nice hotel - I'll be back. We stayed for four nights in this hotel, which was conveniently located for the main museums and for Berlin's excellent transport system. Our room was quiet, comfortable and well equipped. The buffet breakfast was very good and plentiful. The reception staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful. Hotel is located just 2 minutes walk from the Hackescher Markt S-Bahn station which makes the location perfect. I came for business and had meeting in different areas in Berlin so I just used the S-Bahn which is really efficient and fast. The fact that the hotel is located so close to the station saved me a lot of time and money. The staff in the hotel is very friendly and helpful. Room was good, very clean and comfortable. Internet connection was fast and reliable. There is no A/C in the room and it was bit hot even though it was cold outside. Maybe staying in the hotel during summer might be too hot. Breakfast was excellent with rich varieties of food and this includes also very good staff in the dining room that will take care of you. My wife and I, and another couple stayed for three nights. The Executive Rooms were very good and deserved the four-star marking, as did the breakfast. The staff were excellent and could not do enough to help. The location is very convenient with a five-minute walk to Museum Island or Charlotten Plaz and two minutes from the S-Bahn Station. An ideal and, relatively speaking, affordable hotel. There is no wireless in rooms - only in bar. The breakfast looked like it would have been good, but I did not eat any because there were flies crawling on the meat and cheese, and the eggs were well undercooked. The room was too hot (I was given a fan, but there is no AC). Aside from that, the room was simple and fine and the location is great. But considering everything, this place is seriously overpriced.",,,
blondeangel722003,100584,"Not too far from the airport, but not close to downtown. You have to take the train or a cab to reach downtown. It was a decent price for the room. Clean and semi-quiet.

Right next to the Space Needle so that was awesome. I booked this hotel as it was my only option left the day of arrival. It is right next to the Space Needle and we did walk from the hotel down to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. When checking into the hotel, the front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful. Every staff member that I encountered was in a great mood and smiling. The room was not the best that I've seen and definately not the worse. There were two beds, a fridge and I think a microwave, although I can't remember for sure. The beds were comfortable. The room was a bit noisy with traffic, but I was able to sleep. The bathroom was small. The whole room could use a paint job and some new furnishings. They do offer a continental breakfast but I didn't get to check it out. I paid $114 for the night which I can't complain about. Would I stay there again? Possibly. Would I recommed it to you? If you're not too picky, then give it a chance. My boyfriend and I referred to this place as ""our dump"" after checking out. The man who took my reservation over the phone was rude, and short when I was asking questions. When we arrived to check in he was worse. I was disappointed when we got into our room, but it was to late. We had to ask for light bulbs for the desk lamp, and ashtrays. No ice, the machine was out of order, and the complementary breakfast was over at 9 am, which we missed. The worst part was that the housekeeper used so much bleach in the bathroom, that my skirt got bleached out when i leaned against the basin of the sink. plus the floor was slippery. I have been in many hotels but this hotel is worst place to stay....the staff was too rude...and the whole room was smelling .....even in bathroom they didnt have shop and when we asked about shop the guy told somebody has stolen the shop..... My husband and I had to travel to Seattle for a doc appt and a procedure. We checked in on Dec 7th 2010 and had already paid for the room on hotels.com. When we arrived the lady at the desk said that they were going to charge us for parking $7 a day. Then we get to our room and the keys don't work so my husband had to go downstairs to get another key and when he came back up we were now in a diffrant room. We walked in and OMG. There were holes in the bathroom door. Stains on the carpet. The bed looked broke in half. The heater was hard to get goig because the knobs were broke off and you couldn't tell if it was on cool or heat. We had been up since 4am and said screw it we are tired, The traffic was just insance. The noise made is so hard to sleep and the volum on the tv was not great. You could barley hear what they were saying on TV. The staff was the only thing good about our stay there. The lady that checked us in was able to give us good directions to where we needed to go. The swimming pool and spa were not great to look at and that was our view...they both had green water in them filled with alge. We recommend not staying there. Motel 6 is much better. dirty carpet, broken towel rods, broken curtain pulls, no TP or Kleenex, peeiing paint, sketchy continental bfst, noisy, reservations not as requested, phone not working, remote not working, lights burnt out etc. etc.,no fitted sheets,slept on bare mattress most of night The hotel is really terrible. There were no towels when we walked into the room. After a few calls asking for towels, the receptionist (or the owner) even asked me to go down and grab the towels myself. Finnally I got my towels which were not fully dried yet, the person said the towels will be dry later. What could I say! I asked for a morning call so I wouldn't miss the train, however, they did not give me a morning call at all. I paid when i checked in, but they almost charged me again when i was ready to check out. In a word, Lousy! We came up to Seattle for a show at The Funhouse, and this hotel was perfect. It is two blocks away from the venue (and the space needle) and by far the cheapest hotel in the area. There's plenty of free parking, cable, a pool, free wifi (though a little spotty) and all the employees were helpful. The rooms are on the smaller side, but not too crowded for four people. It was clean, and we all felt safe. I would definitly stay here again. 1st off I called several weeks in advance for the reservation and price with room, pet fee, and taxes got a total of $144.36. Wife called a week later to double check the rate and was given the exact same rate. We arrived and went to check in the young man charged us the exact rate we were told WITH pet as well. Then the haji old man Indian came running after us asking for more pet fee. When I said we have 2 quotes at this price and your employee charged us the same price as quoted, he stated (in terrible broken engrish) ""no no, that can't be the rooms start at $149 so no way you owe me more"" (rooms are $109!) Being we had drove from Portland for a concert and all the rooms were booked nearby I reluctantly HAD to pay another $25 Then we got to our chithole of a room with the overwhelming stench of mothballs and carpet fresh trying to cover whatever god awful oder was there before. I could hardly breath and had to go get a fan and put in the window to air the room out! Dont' waste you time or money on this dump and chitty managment! We stayed here only one night, only, thankfully, for new years eve (we were partying in downtown to ring in the new year and my friends from the area live in a far away suburb and it wouldn't be cost effective to get a taxi). What garbage. I know this place is cheap compared to other hotels in the area, but boy, I didn't know how cheap. Honestly - you are better off staying in a hostel if you had to choose. Or maybe sleeping in your car until you are sober enough to drive. The staff were okay...but the quality of the hotel...my god...sleeping in a sleeping bag at the bottom of the space needle would have been better. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. I would not have showered in the bathroom - using the toliet was bad enough. When my friends found this cheap accomodation, I thought to myself, ""oh, it's just one night, how bad can it be"". I should have saved that money for the car ride home! I chose this place because it was close to the space needle, looked clean online and offered a continental breakfast, plus parking. I placed the reservation for a non smoking room with 2 beds since I was with my 2 young children. When I got there they had my reservation all wrong! The told me they were doing me a favor and would give me the last room they had with 2 beds and was non smoking. The parking was supposed to be free but I was charged for it. When I finally got checked in, they did get me a room with 2 beds but it was smoking, actually the whole place besides the lobby smelled like smoke. The carpeted floor was sticky, the clock didn't work and there was mildew in the bathroom. We were only going to be there for about 7 hours and I didn't want to try to find a place at 10:00 pm. When people started coming in the early morning they made so much noise they woke us up, you could here EVERYTHING GOING ON. In the morning the ""continental"" breakfast consisted of mini muffins, mini bagels w/ creme cheese and orange juice. That was it. No butter, no jam nothing else. They wanted their plastic knives back to reuse. If you go to this place, make sure you are up to date on all of your shots, you might need it!",,,
Danny L,120766,"Tried to check out from 8.45 PM the evening before I had to leave because of an early meeting. Unfortunately it proved impossible to get a hold of any staff before 8am the next day (an hour after I should have checked out). I tried calling the after hour phone they had listed on their door for such circumstances, but no answer even though I called about 5 times. When I finally got check out it turned out that they couldn't accept any creditcards even though there card machines and logos from the major credit card companies on the reception desk. That meant that I had to go out and locate an ATM. When I returned with the cash I found out that they weren't able to provide me with a receipt, I had to wait to 10 o'clock to get that, since I already ran late they promised to email me the receipt at 10am (not sure why 10am was the receipt time), but of course, I have not received any receipt. If it wasn't for the fact that they had my passport locked up I would have left right away leaving the issue of an un-payed bill to the incompetent staff. Besides that I have had construction work right outside my window that they didn't inform about, the shower was ""fixed"" with duct tape, the wi-fi works maxium 15 minutes before it dies out (tried to post this while in my room, but internet didn't work for 40 minutes) remote control doesn't work and the only place for my carry on bag was on the floor, next to the bed. The room in general is dirty and worn down. Like others have mentioned, the hotel has a great location, but that doesn't justify the prize for this hotel which is not a hotel, it's dirty hostel that charges 4 star price. very nice hotel and free full breakfast friendly staff price is usually abit high but keep checking they usually drop if u book close to ur date i stay here everytime i visit orlando. very nice hotel and free full breakfast friendly staff price is usually abit high but keep checking they usually drop if u book close to ur date i stay here everytime i visit orlando. I have to say that my stay over this past weekend was a true pleasure. First off Christine could not have been any friendly or more accommodating. She made me feel at home after a very tough trip in and that was only compounded by the fact that the room was clean and spacious, the free breakfast was excellent, and the value could not have been any better. I will absolutely stay here again and am very grateful for how wonderful things were during my stay. not bad for the price the hotel is old but it is clean the rooms and beds are clean the breakfast is a joke but other than that would stay here aginb for the races just a short 2.5 mile walk to the speedway. just take it as it is a economy stay hotel and you will be happy there is alot worse out there trust me.","I have to say that my stay over this past weekend was a true pleasure.

I will absolutely stay here again and am very grateful for how wonderful things were during my stay. Hotel was somewhat dirty and rooms very dated. Elevator was broken most of time and breakfast was most limited have seen in quite a while. Nothing nearby in walking distance as hotel sits in warehouse area. Airport is close by. Would not stay again really needs some upgrading. Great location to get to all parts of city for insurance claims. Had smaller room which left much to be desired for office space, but otherwise GREAT staff, great COFFEE. If you can afford to upgrade get the bigger room. This room was packaged with a flight at a combined great value. It's near the airport. Lovely lobby, new carpet. I was expecting a regular hotel room, and was pleasantly surprised with the kitchenette (stove, full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishes, glasses, etc.) Separate sitting room outside bedroom with table for either eating or working. Carpet and paint looks pretty new. Two TV's. Furniture a little scuffed, but not objectionable for a two-star. Matress very firm. Linens and towels basic. Kitchen and bathroom fixtures pretty worn and dated, if that type of thing matters to you. Front desk staff was prompt, helpful and polite, even printing out my Boarding Pass for me. Card key reader to outer door was broken, so had to walk around to the lobby in very, very cold weather. Main disappointment was the breakfast - maybe I've been spoiled by other chains, but the breakfast room was so large and newly done, I thought surely the food would be comparable. Otis Spunkmeyer packaged muffins, some oranges and apples were the total items. Plus side was a good choice of coffee and creamers, available all day. I wish I had allowed time to go out for breakfast. I wouldn't mind staying here again for a few days, particularly at this price, but wouldn't go out of my way, either. The other guests were very nice and polite. Free parking. Printer available. The hotel was such a nice place to stay. The rooms were clean and updated. All the staff were very courteous and well trained. I would stay here again and recommend it to others. Illinois Traveler I had to stay in Indianapolis for 6 weeks before transfering out with my job. I needed a place with a kitchen and thought this would be a great place to stay and the price was right. Besides the really nice lobby, the room I was in was an absolute dump. Old. Smelled old, the bed was hard, pillows sucked....carpet was old and dirty. Needless to say I checked out the following morning and I will never go back. I actually steer clear from all other Extended Stays now due to this experience. Holiday Inns are a lot nicer than this place! My son found this hotel when searching for an apartment to rent for a summer internship. No apartments to be found who were willing to sign such a short-term lease. The weekly rate was very reasonable for an efficiency with a queen-size bed, so he booked a second room - 1 bedroom King for his parents for two nights, so we could help him settle in. For the price, I anticipated that the hotel would be rather worn and perhaps ""scary"", but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby area was clean and well-lit. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with suggestions for where to eat, buy groceries, etc. The breakfast was light- packaged muffins, whole fruit, coffee and juice- but good quality. The rooms were clean, but furniture and carpet were worn- not surprising at this price point. The other guests seemed to include a church youth group (very polite), many temporary workers who went to bed early and left early in the morning, and some families on vacation. Although the walls are not particularly well-insulated, the other guests were very quiet, so noise was not a problem. The bed was very comfortable; mattress seemed new, and linens were clean. Pool was clean and pleasant. Fitness room small, but with good equipment- treadmill, stair climber. Guest laundry on-site. For about half the price of the newer extended stay hotels, I would say it is an excellent value. Nice to have the extra room and the ability to fix snacks or a light lunch or dinner in the kitchenette. I booked a room several months in advance at this property for the Indy 500 weedend. First problem upon arrival was that the desk clerk tried to overcharge. Fortunately I had a reservation printout showing the agreed upon rate. The deal-breaker problem was that the room was swealtering hot with broken AC - unlivable on this 95 degree day - and no other rooms were available. Things went downhill fast when the teenaged solo deskclerk contacted property manager, Michelle Mouser, by phone and allowed me to speak to her. After whining to me about her current physical ailments, Ms. Mouser volunteered her overwhelmed desk clerk to find alternative accomodations for us. The result was a smoking room with one bed. Thank you very little. After making literally dozens of phone calls my son and I were finally able to secure a room at the Hilton Garden Inn, paying almost triple what I had agreed to pay for the Extended Stay Deluxe accomodations, but at least we had livable conditions and were able to enjoy the 500. BTW, I also had tix to the night before the 500 races at IRP and we couldn't go due to having to the mess created by Extended Stay Deluxe. The Extended Stay property manager, Ms. Michelle Mouser, demonstrated her complete incompetance in handling this situation and Rachel, the pathetic child she left in charge of the hotel on arguably the busiest weekend of the year, appeared incapable of managing her own Facebook page, nevermind an entire hotel. Mr. Jeff Orme, presumably Area or District manager, you and your staff owe my son and I a tremendous apology, and you sir, have a big problem with the staff at this establishment. May I assure you, I will never consider visiting another Extended Stay property in the future, and I hope this review will steer others potential customers away from your dump. We chose this hotel because it was the closest to downtown Indianapolis that we could get during Final Four weekend. I also liked the idea that it was a suite with kitchenette. Because this is an extended stay property, there is limited staff on hand. There is no daily housekeeping service, but you can exchange towels at the front desk if necessary. The property is in an industrial area, so there is nothing within walking distance except a Waffle House, a gas station/convenience store and a Schlotsky's deli. There is a continental breakfast of sorts, mostly coffee juice, fresh fruit and some pre-packaged muffins. They call it a ""gourmet coffee bar"". Nice for a snack to get started. Overall impression of the room was that although it was clean, it is time for an upgrade to the entire room. The kitchenette has a refrigerator, two burner cooktop, dishwasher, mini microwave, and coffee maker. The dishes are old and need to be replaced, especially the cups. They were plastic and chipped from wear. The living area had a couch and one leather recliner. The couch upholstery and the carpet were both stained and worn which really made the entire room look old. The closet is just a niche in the wall- no enclosure. The bathroom is only big enough for the toilet and shower, so the sink and vanity are in the sleeping area. It was clean, but the grout and fixtures need a good scrubbing. On the plus side, the shower was very strong, the towels were newer and the tub area seemed to be recently renovated. We had two doubles which made the sleeping area very crowded. You could only get in on one side of each bed because one side was up against the wall, which made it very difficult to make the beds, even just to pull up the comforter. The sheets came off the edge of the bed every time I rolled over because the elastic was worn, but the pillows and sheets were clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable. Overall it was comfortable and suited our needs, but I would not want to stay here for more than a weekend. This hotel was an awesome value! The staff was courteous and friendly. The room was clean and well appointed for hotel at this price point. The only real noise was from the airport nearby but it wasn't too bothersome. We will definitely stay here again when we are in this area.",,,
John X,2515770,"Newly renovated. Rooms are modern. Kitchen and bath had been updated with granite. My gripe: I know check in is 3pm, but I have never been refused checkin anywhere because it wasn't 3pm on the dot. Most hotels will be accommodating and give you a room or if it's a very busy hotel they will ask you to check back in an hour. NOT this place. It was 12:30 and the woman at the desk didn't even look at the computer. She just said no and to come back after 3. Understand that this is not exactly a booming hotel. It's in a business park and I can assure you there was a room available on a Thursday afternoon. +an excellent hotel!The photos show the reality.The room was fantastic,big,clean,with nice view.The room has refrigerator,safe box,hair dryer.The neighborhood is quite,with lot of parks and you feel safe to walk even at midnight.Don't miss to see the Rabla de Pomplenou. The metro station is 2 minutes away and you can reach the city center(Jaume I) in ten minutes or Passeig de Cracia at 15 minutes. Hot water and very good service.Good price for value. - The bed was very hard for me. Newly renovated. Rooms are modern. Kitchen and bath had been updated with granite.

I am in town for 4 nights, and this is night one. I already booked another hotel for the other 3 immediately after checkin; have to stay tonight because I am locked in for one night already. I don't feel safe here at all. The clientel that I have seen since checkin reminds me more of a motel 6. The only reason I gave a ranking of two, is you get what you pay for. Budget price, well... The room seems relatively clean, but outdated, and there is no maid service during your stay. The office closes at 10, and you'll need to call the attendant if checking in or have any need after that. The attendant was very friendly though. It has a motel feel for sure. Personally I would rather feel safe and have a comfortable stay somewhere else, with better ammendeties. I had a meeting, and stayed at Homestead Studio in San Diego/ Mission Valley. The room is clean, and remodeled (and somehow it's still smell fresh paint.) Night attendant was friendly though I checked in after midnight. The hotel is close main freeways, shopping, but very quiet. Good value for a short trip in San Diego. Newly renovated. Rooms are modern. Kitchen and bath had been updated with granite.

Nancy L,549441,"We had a fantastic stay here over the long Halloween weekend. The two double beds were super comfortable and we had two big windows overlooking the streets. We were also lucky enough to have a small sitting area right outside our room which made our space a lot bigger and more comfortable. The staff was wonderful and we really appreciated the friendliness of the housekeeping employees who took care of us to no end. They took pictures of us in our costumes and really gave us a great feeling about the people of New Orleans. The lobby staff were wonderful as well. Everyone was very helpful and seemed sincerely interested in making this trip the best possible. The lobby was gorgeous and had a really nice model of the city which was a cool way of getting orientated. The only complaint we had was that the windows did not open which made the room a little stuffy. Also, it was fabulous weather and we would have liked to have some fresh air in the room. My mother and I stayed at this hotel in September. It was still very hot in Italy and the AC worked nicely. Our room was actually quite spacious for Rome hotels (I have been too many) and it was clean. Internet was great and skype worked well and it was free. Breakfast was good with more than a croissant for choice. Really liked Guiseppe who organized transport, a great restaurant (only Italians ate there except us). Staff were very friendly. As long as you stay away from the expensive restaurants on Via Veneto its a nice location. Its a hoot to walk by Harry's Bar anyway. We did pick up the bus tour for my mom down a few blocks and that worked out as she had not been to Rome. I have to go Rome again this yr and plan to rebook at Hotel Golden and its genuine, clean, reasonable, good wifi and very very helpful front desk staff. I came from Philly to LA to run the marathon this past weekend so it was important to stay somewhere inexpensive that could guarantee a stress-free and restful couple of nights prior to the race. This place did the job. Be forewarned, you will get the bare minimum here (like no bedside lamps!). Everything is outdated, the WiFi is temperamental, and you will be hard pressed to get a smile from the staff. However, none of those factors made the stay here bad. At the end of the day I had a clean, comfortable bed and a spot-on 4 AM wake up call. For under $70/night what more could I have asked for? We always choose this hotel when staying in Indianapolis. It is close to great shopping, lots of dining options, and a very comfortable place to stay. We have never had a problem with one of our stays and I highly recommend TownePlace Suites in Indianapolis/Keystone. We were very pleased with all aspects of this trip. A young man named Aaron was especially nice and helpful. Great breakfast! Hot cobbler and ice cream every night. Nov 14th - 18th. Would stay here again!!!! Great location, beautiful unit, unbelievable view. We were in room 442 and would recommend it highly. This is our third trip, the first two being about 20 years ago. It's even better than I remembered. Love the outdoor grills and eating area. Loved the cabana with TV's to watch the Presidents Cup with other golf fans. Staff was great. Everyone always knew our names. We had family staying next door at the Westin, but most of the time they hung out at the Alii. Such a convenient location. I can't say enough....it was heaven!!!! I have stayed at almost every Hilton property in Chicago, The staff at Homewood are the best. The hotel is clean and takes care of all guests as family. Staff are professional and positive. You can't put a price on service. This funky old hotel is well located downtown for walking and for riding the light rail. We took the light rail from the airport to the end of the line (Westlake) and then walked 3 blocks to the hotel. Our room was a bit cut up with the tub in one room and the toilet and sink in another tiny room. I think there are other rooms with a standard layout, and I would ask for that. The price of $120 was good, and I would stay here again. This funky old hotel is well located downtown for walking and for riding the light rail.

We were away most of the times. However, I forgot my mobile phone at the hotel when I checked out. Later, I called the hotel and a hotel employee named ""Zia"" was very helpful and kind enough to agree to send me my mobile phone back to where I live (Idaho). Waiting for the phone now. Out of gratefulness, I am giving a 4 score. :) I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and enjoyed it. The hotel staff is helpfully and nice with the guests. The rooms are spacious and clean, the hotel is changing the carpet, the refrigerator was spacious and there are a desk. The hotel provides free internet access. I am in Los Angeles for business and I received that I expect for the price. The breakfast is basic, It contain: a cup of coffee, bread, cornflakes with milk and glass of juice is it enough for me. Good luck visiting Los Angeles, haaaÂ¡Â¡Â¡ the Hotel Location is very good and of course is on budget. So Ive been travelling all over the world and i'm pretty laid back....i also dont normally write reviews as i dont mind a bit of dirt or if something is not perfect but we checked in to this motel and i always ask for a room upstars as there are less insects...anyway i was sat on the bed when a huge cocroach ran out from under the bed....i was a bit grossed out but decided to try catch it..... until i pulled the cover back off the bed and found loads of little lice looking things crawling all over the sheets....I have stayed in some awful places in vietnam and never seen anything this bad, so i went down and said at the desk that i was willing to stay there if they could move me to another room which they refused to do and they also refused to give me a refund so we had to leave and pay for another room in another motel! DO not go here Nice Hotel. The room was clean. Have the metro only 15-20 min walking. The staff was always very nice and helpful. Just have a poor breakfast. Excelent price! We stayed at the hotel in May. We ware looking for the cheap hotel close to Hollywood and comparing 4 or 5 hotels around the area this came the best for the price .The rooms ware big, the bathroom was clean, and the bedroom floor was not perfect but acceptable. The stuff at the desk was very nice as we have a problem with a delivery. They allowed us to use the telephone for free as we needed to call FedEx to sort out the problem. We choose a quiet room with a city view and were really nice in the evenings. The location is good if you have a car .The hotel offers a free parking. The breakfast is basic, donuts and coffee, serial and milk, juice.Has small swimming pool we did not use. It is good for a short stay .I just could advice the management to put some more effort into cleaning the rooms and the whole place. I had my doubts about staying here after reading a couple of negative comments and the fact that it is one of the cheapest hotels in LA. I was very happy with the place as it was clean, quiet and well located to downtown LA, Hollywood and the freeways. The surrounding area is mainly residential so not a lot of options for restraunts, clubs, etc but only a very short drive to the busier areas. You get what you pay for and I was very satisfied with this hotel. If you're just looking for somewhere to sleep then you really should consider this hotel. We stayed at this hotel and enjoyed it. The hotel staff is professional and helpful to guests. The rooms are spacious and clean, the refrigerator was spacious and had a counter on top. There was a table with two chairs and a desk. The hotel is above the street and the rooms were quiet. We will stay there again. But the neighbourhood was a little rough. We had a car. I would not recommend anyone to walk around in any bigger circles alone in that area. Good room. Ice machine on the outside. Free internet, free breakfast (not that good). very nice clean rooms nice pool comfy beds enjoyed my stay. Dont stay here if you expect at least some level of common courtesy from the desk/admin staff, working wireless internet (at any speed), a room that doesn't fall apart (faucet falling off, walls peeling and other generic disrepair etc) and a breakfast promise that delivers cornflakes with warm milk in a foam bowl at best.....what a way to end an otherwise brilliant holiday..... Dont waste your money coming to this place. It is very very low grade. You should not make the mistake i ve made and booked with money up front with no agreement for a refund. The room I have been provided is dirty with broken tiles on the floor.Shower parts coming off the wall. The room has a mould smell that could not be removed from the noisey AC. I cannot tell you how unhappy I am now that I have spent my money. The mananger is not helpful at all. The whole site needs knocking down and starting again. It is delapatated beyound repair. The tv has the worse reception I have ever seen and I have travelled all over the world. This place was not the worse place I've ever stayed at, but its really close! The beds were comfy and the water was hot and they had a swimming pool, but thats where the good ends. Our bathroom had tons of mildew, there was trash underneath both of the beds, cigarette burns everywhere, people carved on every surface there was(beds, mirrio, entertainment center) our phone didn't work to call out, but the front desk could call us. No radio/alarm/clock radio of any sort. no directory, hotel info or bible in the room. we stayed 3days and 2nights and never had our room serviced. had to hunt down the laundry person to get more towels. They said they had free wi-fi but we never used it because the guy at the desk wouldn't give us the password over the phone. I wouldnt ever consider them again. I am wondering if I should start a new career as a hotel inspector?? you know just like they have food inspectors...because this one needs to be inspected and disinfected and rejected....never again will we be back but I can assure you if there's a person in my life that I don't care for, I would DEFINATELY reccommend this place!!! We went into the motel at 11:30am thinking we may be able to get our room early....since there was only around 5 cars in the parking lot and our son had to use the restroom badly. The guy at the front desk said no we couldn't, than we asked if we could use his bathroom and he again said no. We said okay we'll come back. I said theres no rats here is there (i'd read there was in the reviews) and he said yes, we are in LA. What? Are you kidding. the room was okay....comforter was stained...garbage under the bed! As for breakfast it was corn flakes or a donut. Hubby is diabetic so he didn't get to eat. Would not stay again but if you don't care about non-friendly service and garbage under the bed than this is the place for you.",,,

We would definitely stay there again. This hotel is the oldest place on the planet. The apartments are horrible and completely out dated. There is no customer service and you need a form for absolutely everything. The wifi is practically non-existent. Stay in the Hampton Inn down the street. It's worth the walk.

We waited until the last minute to book our hotel and found that availability was extremely limited and hotels were grossly over-priced. The Four Ambassadors provided us with a clean (albeit rustic) room that was large enough for our entire party at a very competitive rate. The room was clean, spacious, and charming. The view was beautiful, the grounds were well kept, and the hotel employees were friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends who were traveling to the Miami area. In all sincerity, the only downside I can share is the lack of an ice machine.",,,
randywood1981,205866,"Fantastic hotel with very little to complain about. Pro: The room was very well appointed. Room was very clean, room service cleaned rooms very well. Bed was firm, not hard. Bedding material was very nice. Shower pressure was great. Breakfast has a great selection. Quick walk to the subway system. Great views of the city if you get a high floor room. Cons: The room itself was too cold! Unless we turned off the air, the room got too cold even on the highest setting. If we turned it off the room was too hot. Called to see if they could fix it, but they said they couldn't. Seems over air-conditioning is a problem throughout Singapore. There was a line up for the buffet breakfast the first morning we were there, and not a short one, we were in line about 20 minutes. Next day was only 5 mins, but still the first time I've ever had to line up to have breakfast. Pool should be heated. It was 32C the day we went, and even at 3pm it was too cold to step into. But the staff at the pool is very helpful and attentive. Free wifi is very slow. Rooms weren't the biggest, but was ample and very clean. Bed was very comfy and the shower was fantastic. Breakfast was really good, could have used some more hot foods though, like toast or eggs. Lots of yogurts, cereals, jams, pastries and hot beverages. Fresh fruits as well. Location was just fine by us, every thing was close by thanks to the station being right there. Nothing was more than 20 minutes away except for Versailles. Our room faced the street and noise was never an issue being on the 5th floor, the other side of the hotel faces the train station though, not sure how much noise came through to those rooms. Staff were not the friendliest, but they weren't unfriendly. I would definitely stay again. Loved loved loved this place. Everything was very very clean. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. The bed was huge and very very comfortable. The rain shower was thoroughly enjoyable. Free movies, free adult movies, free Wifi and ridiculously cheap calling rates from the room phone was a first to have combined in one hotel. Location was so easy, the number 5 tram comes right outside and you're downtown in 10 minutes, at the red light district in 15. 10 minute ride from the hotel to the airport using Zuid station. The only complaint one could have is that the rooms are on the smaller side, but my girlfriend and I had no problem with this as we spent most of our time in the room on the large king size, incredibly comfortable bed. Also, make sure you're comfortable with whomever you're staying with. The shower doors are see through and the frosted glass around the toilet does not hide much and is not...how do I say this...soundproof. This place was so cool with it's very trendy design, it's location so great, it's price unbeatable for the quality you're getting, those complaints made no difference whatsoever. Loved it here, would definitely stay again. Definitely deserves it high ranking. Not sure why this place gets even one bad review. We stayed in one of the newer rooms, which are fantastic. The bed is large and comfortable, the room is large and comfortable as well as well appointed. The LCD Tv was great, though the movie and Wifi package was a bit pricey. The shower was one of the best I've had at a hotel. Very clean, and spacious. The buffet breakfast was very satisfying and the bar food was pretty good too, loved the pizza for 6.50 euros. The hotel is about a 15 to 20 minute ride from the major attractions. It was also very easy to reach from the airport. The buses run frequently and honestly, we never once paid to ride the bus or the train from the airport since no one checks. It is cheap to ride the bus though, only 1 euro, we just didn't have change all the time. The train from the airport is now 8 euro each way, and is a short ride and no one checked, so save your money and act like you didn't know if caught. We loved our stay in this modern hotel in a very unmodern city. It is being changed to a Holiday Inn, so prices will probably go up. Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Take public transport to get here. The shuttle is expensive, 40 euro for two, and a taxi to the airport is about 34 euro. It took literally 30 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel by train then bus. And there's no cheaper than free. There aren't many restaurants within walking distance, but the hotel does offer a free shuttle to some local restaurants, but we were so full from dinner on the way back to the hotel we never used this service.","me and my girlfriend were searching flight to rome about ages.. when we finally found this hotel online we thought its great.. after reading some review on other sight we secound thought but we decided to go on it. we didnt regret it at all! from the start when we arrived the hotel the staff was realy plesent and realy helpfull. the room was big and beauttifull and realy comftrable. the hotel is realy far from the city. BUT outside the hotel like 5 m away there is a buss stop that take u all the way to the city or the metro basicly everywhere u want to go!! we have been 8 days at this hotel and i can say it was great! i recommend this hotel to every1! Not sure why this place gets even one bad review. We stayed in one of the newer rooms, which are fantastic. The bed is large and comfortable, the room is large and comfortable as well as well appointed. The LCD Tv was great, though the movie and Wifi package was a bit pricey. The shower was one of the best I've had at a hotel. Very clean, and spacious. The buffet breakfast was very satisfying and the bar food was pretty good too, loved the pizza for 6.50 euros.

We spent 4 days on this hotel good: very nice design inside, nice people (they don't speak englihs very well), nice room, Very nice! bad: internet is not free and is very expensive, we asked for kingsize bed and we get two separate beds with the promise that we will be moved to another room with kingsize bed (but we didn't, they forgot), condisioning not working all the time, very thin walls. We were able to hear the neighbor making live with his partner, or the cars on the street trough the glass of the windows. For a country as Italy, is a good hotel. we went in march 2009. visited all the places in rome and stayed for 1 week. it was best of my trips",,,
Sitta,206987,"The hotel is just across the street (well, it is a big street!) from Atocha railway station (and airport bus). The breakfast is excellent with fresh and dried fruit, a bowl of natural youghurt, selection of loose leaf teas etc etc. Our room was small and hadn't much of a view (to say the least) but was dead quiet and well equipped. The air conditon worked and was not noisy. My only real critique is that the bed were a bit too soft. Staff spoke English. The location is good - except for access by taxi, maybe beacuse of road work going on. The staff were very nice and seemed honestly to care about us. The room was nice, but rather small and without windows. Breakfast was perfectly OK and the breakfast room nice. The surroundings are very inetresting. Good place!","I stayed one night at the NH Sur. I had previously stayed for 4 nights in the Puerto del Sol area and wanted something in a less chaotic area for one night between my Barcelona flight and my flight back to the US. The hotel was fine for one night but there is no way I would stay there for any longer than that. I was in a single room with no view (and thus, no light); the bedding included a very faded blue blanket and an equally faded upholstered headboard. The room was very, very dark as were the institutional-like hallways. My room felt very worn and unwelcoming. Overall, this hotel was very uncomfortable for me and I was glad I was only there for one night. At less than $80 a night, you get what you pay for, I suppose. The upside includes excellent access to the Metro as well as the train station where you can catch the airport shuttle. As others have said, the great advantage of this fairly small hotel is its position. One can see it from the airport express bus as it pulls into Atocha Station. You then just cross the road at the traffic-lights. I received a warm and friendly welcome at reception and was able to check in slightly early. The room was clean and warm - nights at this time of year (February) in Madrid are very cold. Our only criticism was the noise of the lift (not too bad but still annoying) every night and early morning. It was very near our room. Maybe it would be a good idea to ask for a room that is not too near the lift. The road in front of the hotel is very busy indeed. So, it is worth asking for a quiet room not overlooking the street. The breakfast was fantastic, especially the fresh orange juice. The choice of teas was excellent. There is no hot food, although we were more than happy with the cold meats and hard-boiled eggs. Again, there was a wide range of breads available, which one could toast. It was disappointing that the free wifi is only for 30 mins a day in the lobby. However, it was good that there is a free safe available at reception. Returning to the location of this hotel...it was an easy walk to many attractions/restaurants. Or, if you prefer, there is a metro stop almost outside the hotel. We enjoyed a visit (free on Sundays) to the small museum next-door to the hotel. All-in-all, I would recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again on my next visit to Madrid. We were overnighting between train and air connections. The hotel is reasonably priced and very convenient to the Atocha train station (across the intersection). It is also an easy walk with bags to get a bus or the Metro to the airport. The biggest negative for us was wireless. There is no wireless in the room and limited free wireless in the lobby. The hotel is just across the street (well, it is a big street!) from Atocha railway station (and airport bus). The breakfast is excellent with fresh and dried fruit, a bowl of natural youghurt, selection of loose leaf teas etc etc. Our room was small and hadn't much of a view (to say the least) but was dead quiet and well equipped. The air conditon worked and was not noisy. My only real critique is that the bed were a bit too soft. Staff spoke English. The hotel is across the street from Atocha station, so a good base for exploring Madrid and catching trains to other cities...The rooms are very small - with a double bed (I'm using the American version of a double here - so smaller than a queen, but larger than a twin. The problem was no air conditioning. It was very hot in the rooms, and the AC was broken and/or not cut on yet, which apparently is common in European countries. The only way I could sleep was to sleep naked with a wet towel on top of me. I wouldn't recommend staying here in warm weather. My wife and I were on our way from a week in Sevilla to our flights from Barajas and decided to spend a day and night in Madrid to break the trip. We arrived on the AVE from Sevilla at the Atocha station, took the escalator to the upper level, and the elevator to the street and were about 50 feet from the hotel entrance. We dropped our bags at the hotel and had the day for touring rather than schlepping luggage. Since the hotel is minutes from the Prado, Royal Botanical Garden, and Retiro Park, there is plenty to do nearby. The next morning the same elevator took us to Atocha station where we caught the Cercania then the Metro to Barajas. Couldn't have been easier. For an extended stay in Madrid, I would make a different choice, but if you want access to Atocha there is no better option.",,,
AdeleL885,529991,"This hotel is a 10 minute walk from Termini Stazione. It's a pretty easy walk to, easy to find. The receptionists were both brilliant. The man working during the day offered excellent advice, a good map, as well as instructions on which bus to take from near the hotel (as well as the helpful information that bus drivers don't sell tickets, you need to get them from a Tabacci Shop). No question was too silly for either of the receptionists, they happily answered them as best they could. The lady serving breakfast was lovely, she didn't speak much English, but asked the receptionist to translate for me/her. The breakfast itself was continental and lovely!! Would stay here again! This hotel was a bit tricky to find, but it was due more to the fact I can't read maps very well! The reception is in a different building to where I stayed, but honestly, that caused no problems, there was a phone in the room that could be used to contact reception if there were problems. The room was clean and well maintained, it was a bit small, but it was a single. The breakfast was a satisfactory continental breakfast (with a tasty cappucino). The location is briliant, it's one of the first casse's off the Grand Canale next Piazza San Marco. Talking to other holiday makers (during tours and since leaving there), I've discovered I was very spoilt with the position. The staff are friendly and helpful and the young man on reception even carried my suitcase up the stairs (one flight) without me even asking!!! I will definitely stay there again.","This hotel is a 10 minute walk from Termini Stazione. It's a pretty easy walk to, easy to find. The receptionists were both brilliant.

Unfortunately I cannot remember on his name. (wearing glasses, middle age). Only two things: the bath room. Its very small, seems like they bought from the camping, the TV was the same age like me (30), and only one channel was working properly. I am planing to go back to Rome this spring, and my first choice will be this hotel definitely. i will totally agree with this guy's comment ==> [i would like people to know that he did exacly same things to me.. he was polite at start and for some reason he become a beast shouting ""its MY house, and if i want i kick u out"".. to be honest the best thing of this hotel is the location, nothing BUT nothing else, so i would recommend u to try avoid this hotel.. exept if there is not other solution and u ARE alone, and not couple cuz rooms are aweful.. am 70 kilos and the room seemed so tiny that i could NOT move.. also he made me pay at check in, and not forget to mention that my girl was sitting out of hotel waiting me to pack my things while he started shouting to her and made her go inside and sit at ""living room"" i was ready to call police, but at the end i didnt just because i didnt want troubles at last time, and am not italian.. else i would go for lawsuit..] ****This hotel may be within walking distance to Termini but that's all it has in its favour. The manager started out nice enough but then went Jekyll for no reason and turned into a beast yelling that 'this is MY house and whatever I say goes"". The rooms couldn't be smaller if they tried, the bathroom was mouldy and smelled awful, the shower is more like an upright coffin than anything else, the toilet wouldn't flush, there was no airconditioning and the one small fan didn't work, the internet didn't work and the bed squeaked like it would break if you rolled over (and I'm a small person). That's enough, wouldn't you say? I wouldn't go back if they offered me free accommodation. **** I travelled to Rome for the Italy v Scotland 6 Nations game in 2010, and stayed at the Hotel Harmony for 2 nights. The Hotel was on the small and quirky side, off the beaten track, but only 2 blocks from a metro stop, and about 15 minutes walk from the Main Roma Termini Rail Station. The Service at the Hotel was good, although I didn't have a lot of call to turn to them. Our room was clean and linen changed every day, The staff was very helpful, sure the breakfast was limited but it was full of fresh pastries and coffee was served.

Shops, transport links and a good selection of restaurants within easy walking distance. Restaurant Grappola across the road is very, very good - but not cheap. Rooms were clean and airy (We had a double and a single). Breakfast was a very basic Continental Breakfast, simple but provided a good start to the day. Toilet and bathroom cramped, but works well. We were Booked for two weeks, but stayed for a third (Thanks to an Iclandic Volcano) Staff proved very flexible. Their Internet connection did not work for me - but I have a neolithic machine.. Facilities simple, used the rooftop terrasse to some advantage. Situated in a nice part of the town - British Embassy garden across the Road. On a hill so cooler than town centre For a 2 Star Hotel provided very good value, would go back again.",,,
Kathleen_1418,183072,"The beds were nice, but the rest of the room was average. There's a week wifi signal in the lobby and the internet cafe, otherwise they charge $13 a day for wired internet in the room. $20 per stay to use the small fitness center, which doesn't have enough room or enough machines. The pool is free, but there's no hot tub. The cheapest breakfast in the bistro was $16 for 2 eggs, 1 meat, potatoes, and toast. Premade Sandwiches are $9.50. Parking is $35 a day. The conference facilities are spread over 4 floors, with escalators to get between floors. We stayed in room 103, below grade, but since I hoped to be able to sleep in the lack of light was welcome. It was listed as a king bed, but is really 2 twins pushed together with king size sheets, OK, but not my favourite solution. The room is smaller than most hotel rooms, but it had all the space we needed, the bathroom was an average size with nice amenities. The building itself was lovely, lots of wood paneling, decorative flowers, and a small shelf of books that could be read. Being an old house, stairs and some narrow corridors exist. I'd stay again! The subway was a distant rumble, quieter than many hotel rooms I've stayed in near busy roads or large fans.","Stayed at the hotel for one night in a deluxe room. The room was nothing special, in need of an updating for sure. The lady at the front desk was rude and unhelpful. When we asked her where to park our vehicle and if there was any underground parking in the vicinity, she just gave us a flat no. We had park outside and either pay $20 or wake up at 6am to put more money into the parking machine. The washroom had a half-used roll of toilet paper and the water in the shower came out as a trickle, even turned on full-blast. The room we had was beside a staircase and you could constantly hear people walking up and down the stairs as well as hear people walking around in the rooms above. Check-out was at 11am, and when I called the front desk at 10am to ask for a later check-out, no one answered. I kept calling until finally, someone picked up at 10:50am only to tell me that yes, late check-out is available, but the fee was $25. Even for an extra 30-60 minutes! There are much cheaper hotels that always give you a late check-out if there is no one else checking in. And on the day that we were checking out, I'm sure there wasn't a stream of people waiting to check in to this hotel. Just giving us the proper customer service was all that was needed, but that was neglected. We will never return to this hotel, and will advise friends to avoid it as well. Great location, good value, rooms a little bit tired, but clean and hey, you're only there to sleep! Breakfast could be improved but was OK. Would we stay there again, probably.

The subway was a distant rumble, quieter than many hotel rooms I've stayed in near busy roads or large fans. Madison Manor Boutique Hotel is located near public transit, its primary asset. The room was OK. The bathroom was tiny and suitable only for a very short person. Breakfast was dreadful: cold, tasteless bagels, and such. I could hear the rumble of the Metro every few minutes. There are better choices and values. Have been here once only but was recommended by many people and friends. The hotel/B&B is located into a huge victorian house. So size and confort is a bit of the old times, but details and atmosphere is very nice. The location is also great, near Bloor/Spadina and all Toronto's amenities and public transit. Only sligthly negative sides are: the limited breakfast (but there is plenty of choice in the area) and some noise in the weekend (but you wanted to stay in downtown...). Also, be ready to deal with some stairs without elevator. Overall, I think it is very difficult to get a similar accomodation in an equivalent location, for the price they ask. This was a good place for a one-night stay for my husband and I while out with friends. The room we had faced the busy dive bar the Madison is known for, and it was somewhat loud up until 1 a.m. I drowned it out with the TV, though, so it was fine. Clean, plush rooms and reasonably sized bathrooms. Keep in mind that it's a walk-up, so getting to the room provided a bit of extra exercise; may not be suitable for older or disabled patrons. I recently spent three weeks at this hotel with five colleagues for business. Although there are some positives, such as a clean room and reasonable rates, the negatives greatly outweigh them. Initially, the lack of an actual reception/office was offputting because we had to track down a bartender from the upstairs pub to check us in. Over the next few weeks, several of my colleague's electronic room keys stopped working (one had to get eight replacements), and each time it was past office hours and the bartender had to be found. No apology or solution was ever offered. In addition there is a continental breakfast included in the stay that is no more than stale bagels, oily muffins, and cold hard-boiled eggs. Breakfast is in the main floor of the pub, and several mornings by the time I made it to breakfast there was no food left and many of the tables were dirty and littered with used plateware. Lastly, after a few days of asking reception to call us a cab, we were told that ""Y'know you can call it yourself. There's a phonebook in your room."" After that helpful tip, the phone at reception was no longer answered when we called. Overall a very disappointing and frusterating experience. We reserved in January and requested a room that was quiet. They gave us a room that was facing the street and above the main entrance. The noises and voices we heard most of the night were so bad that we might as well have all been in the same room. We will not be returning. Just to add a little regarding people who have pointed out a noise concern: Ask for a basement room on the north side--you'll be fine. There was a large party next door for New Years Eve (cheapest NYE in Toronto BTW), Sweetie and I had a great/reasonably quiet night's sleep. Location is really convenient. Room was warm, clean, attractive. Bed was comfy, and we enjoyed the breakfast. Excellent deal for Toronto. We'll stay there again. Has a great time. Stayed in Suite that had a gas fireplace, lots of natural light. The place was very clean and quiet (North East side of building), the neightbour hood is somehwat historic and eccentric. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was what would be expected for this price range. Parking was convenient and the hotel is close to the subway and streetcar lines. A great experience and would definately stay there again and recommend it to others. Wonderful renovated Victorian-Style Boutique-Hotel with about 20 rooms, all are lovely and cute. Very friendly staff: While she showed as soom rooms, the Deluxe room (which we preferred) was booked online, so we got the Suite for the same price. Located at the north end of the downtown area next to some good places to eat or buy something on Bloor Street and just a few minutes to the subway. Royal Ontaria Museum (ROM is also just a few steps away. Heard no noise. Breakfast is average. About the room? We got the suite and it was a suite :-) Lovely restored Victorian, no elevator. Noise from the bars next door (part of the complex) and the street late at night made getting a good night's sleep a real struggle. Great if you're in Toronto for the night life; terrible if you're there for a family vacation, retreat or on business.",,,

I felt that for the amount we payed, this hotel exceeded our expectations, and I would definitely stay there again. Its not the ritz, and aspects of it are dated, but to be honest, if you want a really high class hotel, then pay more! Worthless! According to the images seem to be a nice hotel and good two-star hotels, but none of it was true. We got a small room where we had about 45 inches between bed and wall. The room was about 2 meters wide and 3.5 meters long. We had the hotel staff under a newly renovated room. Sure, new furniture, maybe, but then it was not fresh. The TV had poor reception, it was pencil stretch remain on the walls from where they had been feeling, the view can call the view when you can look out on a cement wall? Carpet was not clean, but it was full of hair, dust and crumbs on it. When I complained I was not taken seriously, but was told that it was new so it was impossible that it could be dirty. The toilet was not fresh, the ring was not cleaned over, it was almost an end in the sink and soap in the shower was over. They made Ã¢â¬â¹Ã¢â¬â¹up and folded the towels every day with never cleaned the toilet bowl really well but just poured in the detergent. We had no security locks on the door but we closed it with a simple key, which is not felt so safe. The whole room smelled of paint. Breakfast was not exactly an English breakfast. Dry bread, juice, yoghurt and cereals. Hotel corridors were mangy and the paint had started to come off the walls, mold on the ceiling and smelled old and stuffy. It should not be called Kings Hotel anymore intsead Hobo's Hotel. I love the location the hotel is located in but the hotel was worse than the worst! Beware of the hotel and room nine!! Internet says Ã¢â¬ï¿½...extensive refurbishment of the hotel which offers 27 tastefully decorated guest rooms...Ã¢â¬ï¿½. Right! Look at the pictures and see for yourself Ã¢â¬â maybe we were assigned the 28th room, which had not been refurbished yet? Internet further says Ã¢â¬ï¿½...our friendly staff are fluent...Ã¢â¬ï¿½. Maybe I have a different perception of Ã¢â¬ï¿½friendlyÃ¢â¬ï¿½. Not a single smile from even one person of the staff Ã¢â¬â and I certainly understand that. I could never enjoy working a place like that! Further: Ã¢â¬ï¿½...Breakfast is full continental and on request we can provide English Breakfast...Ã¢â¬ï¿½ Like someone else wrote: Ã¢â¬ï¿½...toast or criossant...Ã¢â¬ï¿½. Well Ã¢â¬â we also had the choice of corn flakes...WOW. And the room was dirty. Run your finger over the shelf or the closet and it is filled with dirt! Walk down the stairs, and you would get the same result there. I mentioned stairs...because thats all there is. And they don't advertise that lack of a lift/elevator. We stayed for one night, and checked out as soon as possible the next morning Ã¢â¬â and was even charged for 2 nights. I didn't even bother to complain about that Ã¢â¬â I just wanted to get the hell out of there! My biggest mistake (apart from the hotel reservation) was to not read these reviews...I certainly learned my lesson! Stay far away from this hotel!!! We liked the location, convenient for tube, buses and Hyde Park and about ten minutes easy walk from Paddington Station.The hotel rooms as far as we know the whole lower ground floor and some rooms appeared to have been recently redecorated to a good standard and we had two rooms (one of them not redecorated but still with good standard). i had stayed in this hotel in june 2010, nothing was refurbished before, it looks like they have redecorated now . The room was comfortable with a clean, tiled bathroom, and comfortable beds, . Continental breakfast in a large bright restaurant in the ground floor was excellent, no english breakfast The breakfast staff could possibly have been a little more enthusiastic but a very minor grumble but the manager had been very helpful and friendly. We were allowed to store our bags without charge on the last day until the departure of our train. All in all, a bargain, well worth the price and more i stayed in january 2011 the hotel is in a lovely location and opposite hydepark and 3 minutes walk from queensway tube station and 5 mints walk from bays water tube station station, close to the hotel you find any restaurents in queensway street i was reading the reviews of the hotel, the reviews was not that good about the stuff in the rooms and cleanliness but actually i had in my room new carpet, new duvet covers, new pillows, new tilled bath room etc.. looks like the rooms has been refurbished .the price was not bad i paid only ÃÂ£80 for a dbl bed, value for the money, and the staff is very helpful, and very friendly in simple value for the money in central london and the hotel location is very close to all the london tourist attractions and i will recomend this hotel all of my friends, An OAP On 4th floor no lift. Room not very clean. No plugs basin sink, shower control loose no slip mat.. Non English speaking staff. Breakfast toast or criossant do it your self. No health & safety . No Resturant or bar. Noisy no sleep, Needs closing be warned stay away. It did the job - two friends and I just needed to spend a short night while on a cultural trip in London. Squeaky floors. Beware of fire alarms - they can beep for no reason in the middle of the night! Filthy bathroom so we didn't have a shower. Basic breakfast with strange juice on offer, Better stay at a family B&B if you can! Read the reviews on Tripadvisor and thought to gve it chance... MISTAKE..It is just the filthiest, dirtiest hotel I have ever been to... smelled like cigarette all over,,, the pillows had other people`s hair!!!! the rug was SOO DIRTY!! Any other review you read saying somehting good from this horrible hotel, please DONT TRUST... IT MUS BE THE OWNER WRITTING! PLease dont be conned like I was and dont spend a penny in this horrible spot! this hotel is well worth avoiding if u are planning a trip to london. broken beds , leaks , dirty carpets & decor from the 70s. . breakfast wasnt great either............ SAY NO MORE !!!! we stayed in room 35, 79 stairs up with no lift. room hadn't seen a hoover for a long time, curtains and skirting boards were thick with dust, big cracks on tiles in bathroom and bedroom, tv picture was rubbish, no satalite tv as advertised, wardrobe was manky, no plug in wash hand basin, curtain in bathroom didn't fit, bedside cabinets were full of empty cans and bottles, when we told reception they looked suprised and would deal with it, next day no change( probably still there). 2 for 1 offers in reception were a year out of date, as we found out at ripleys believe it or not. wont be back. Only good thing about this hotel is location, it's close to tube stations & local bus stops. Easy access to Hyde Park & Oxford Street. Well.....where do i start with the bad points......................Everything in room dirty & i mean EVERYTHING!!! Room far too hot, no air con, toilet small & dirty, locks on door insecure, no plug in bathroom for sink or bath, staff did not understand English, restraunt looked scabby and bottle of Cobra was ÃÂ£5 and can of Coke from a multipack was ÃÂ£1.50 served in dirty glass. Overall i would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Noisy, with a room that had not been cleaned properly and linen that looked unwashed on the bed. I did not even go and see what the food would be like... Kings hotel is a very good option for those who are travelling to London. It has an excellent location, is really near the Queensway Station (which is in the central station). You can go by foot to Hyde Park and Harolds, if you have disposition to walk! We stayed in a quadruple room and we have no complaints...The breakfast is basically some croissants with jelly, some toasts with butter and orange juice or coffe. Wasn't too bothered where we stayed as it was a lad weekend. Won't have that same attitude again after staying in this disgustin shell of a place. Water needs to run for 15 minutes before it gets hot, staff ignorant, room filthy and to top it all off there was a giant Cockroach crawling in the room on the second night. Yes it's cheap, but would recommend buying a tent and staying in Hyde Park across the road.",,,
astiarjan,308378,"i stayed at Concorde hotel, Singapore for 3 nights (Nov 25 - 28 Nov 2011) for a family trip. The deluxe room is very spacious and bathroom is clean, too. Location is good, I could get around orchard road area at anytime I want to. there is a bus stop point in front of the hotel. But I have to remind those who hasn't stayed here before, thet the lobby is on 3rd Floor of the building, First 2 floors is food court and shops. Dont be surprised on 2nd floor there are some pubs and karaoke pubs which are a bit crowded during weekends. Luckily the noise isn't an issue. overall, the hotel worth the money we spent during our trip to Singapore. Will definitely recommend this hotel This is my second stay at this hotel...it was on Feb 1-2, 2012. I was staying in standard room and it is very small room. Cleanliness is OK, location is OK, you can go to Bugis Junction and nearby MRT station is Bugis. Accessibility is good and worth the money spent.","This hotel is in a great central location - bus across the street and MRT within easy walk. Walk to Bugis markets and pretty much everything else. Small rooms but clean amd cheap and friendly staff. Great buffet breakfast!!! I was concerned about this being an older hotel. The rooms were small but clean. Bed was comfortable enough. What made it for me was the pleasant service. I had a very early flight and they even prepared a sandwich and a bottle of fruit juice to take with me and helped me hail a taxi. Not luxurious but felt welcome. value for money. This is my second stay at this hotel...it was on Feb 1-2, 2012. I was staying in standard room and it is very small room. Cleanliness is OK, location is OK, you can go to Bugis Junction and nearby MRT station is Bugis. Accessibility is good and worth the money spent. The rooms are out of date and have a musty smell (carpets). We booked it for a layover in April for $80pn (5 people/2 rooms). When we get there the price jumped to $80pp and they called it a ""Festive Season Surcharge"". As it was Xmas we had no choice. The food, and the restaurant was well below standard. At least some of the staff were nice. Please go somewhere else, you've been warned! Hotel is ok, clean and comfortable with very helpful staff, important when in a strange city. Very safe area, (although I suspect most of Singapore is), lots of people out walking in the evenings. Good selection of shops, restaurants nearby. If only there for a day or two, as we were, best to book a city tour which stops at places of interest for photos, as it's too far to walk to most of them. My partner and I stayed here for a few nights whilst we were in Singapore. Great location. Very close to the Bugis St Markets, and Bugis MRT station.Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Quite costly for the small room on a noisy street but there was more good than bad. Always clean and a nice place to rest your head at night. I went to Singapore on a business tour and was booked at Summer View Hotel. The great thing about this hotel is its location. The well known Bugis Street is just about 5 minutes walk! Little India is nearby and so are the other techy stores. It is a bit pricey but this is Singapore! Hotels here are so expensive! But the room I got had windows. That is the best part of it coz some hotels here don't have windows. The room is also clean. And yes, there's a bathtub too. The food.... well, it's just average.... not much to choose from... and it does get boring as the days pass by coz the menu doesn't change. The staff, well what can I say... friendly and unbelievable service! I maybe be biased a bit coz I had surprises thrown on me during my stay. :-) The concierge guy, an old man ( I forgot his name) was super kind and helpful! Check-in and check-out is a breeze! Special thanks to Mel (front desk staff) for making my stay at Summer View a sweet and memorable one! Small room, pretty grotty and outdated, fine if it was cheap but it wasn`t, not when the Ibis across the street is the same money and a million times better. That said the staff were great and the place was clean, too clean in fact, it reeked of disinfectant. Breakfast was OK, good location and bearable for one night, the porter was a lazy so and so and might as well have not been there. To be fair they were very flexible and friendly, I just feel they charged too much for the level of quality. The hotel was clean and efficient and the room although small was comfortable. The aircon worked okay and the breakfasts were good. Booked 5 rooms at this hotel for our group. The staff was very helpful during our entire stay. The rooms though were quite on the small side. All our rooms on the 3rd floor didn't have any window so it was quite scary thinking what could have happened in case there was a fire. I have never stayed in a windowless hotel before. Some of the tvs in the rooms were a small 14 inches so it was an effort to watch shows. Breakfast was basic and the same throughout our 3-day stay. Wi-fi is also quite expensive inside the hotel but there is an internet shop beside it that charges SGD1 for an hour. Good thing, taxis stop in front of the hotel so it was convenient. The hotel is also walking distance to the metro, Bugis and many other tourist places. But for an addtional price, I'd probably stay at Ibis Hotel right across this hotel. My husband and i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and were very disappointed with it.Our room was a twin, the portable TV was to the side of the beds so had to be turned to be viewed but as it was so small you couldnt read the writing or see the picture clearly.The air con couldnt be adjusted you either had it freezing or turned it off....we did both throughout the night..the bathroom was squishy..the toilet behind the door that didnt always flush well.The bath was so high i fell out the first night because i couldnt reach the ground..There was only 1 extra blanket for 2 beds..The breakfast included was below standard serving cold scrambled eggs watered down orange juice and only 1 choice of spreads.The lift had no air con and was very stuffy.We had cleaners knocking on our door at 8.30 to clean...bit much when shops dont open till 11 and you want to lie in and relax On a positive note the location was very good being close electronics complex..Bugis Junction..Little India and a short drive to Chinatown. The bell hops were very helpful and very polite. Would i stay there again? Only if i was desperate. Our stay in the hotel was arranged by Singapore Airlines. We reached at 5 in the morning. and the hotel gave us one room for six people since the package was supposed to be started from next day. they arranged the other room at 12. the rooms were very small but clean. The breakfast room was also small with fewer items. The location of the hotel is not good. In the evening you will find nothing outside the hotel. This hotel was near to local food courts, great for the budget traveller, who likes to eat locally. It was also close to some nice restaurants if you wanted to go a bit more up market. It was in walking distance to the MRT, Orchid Road and a bus stop was across the road. The rooms where old but clean, BUT be aware not all rooms are the same size, some of them seemed quite small. We noticed this as we walked pass rooms that where being cleaned. The negative on this hotel was the restaurant that breakfast was served in, it was too small to cope with the numbers and it was hard to find a table to sit at, in the end we took ours back to the room to eat it, which was not ideal. HoochDarwin We have been in Singapore in March the second time. And we choose this hotel because is situated on the excellent location. The price for Singapore in quite low ....and for this reason you can not expect an perfect hotel.....you will get include in the price a breakfast too. The rooms are not so big but if you need a hotel only to sleep is ok. When I will visit Singapore again I will chose this hotel again because the location is perfect.....10min walk to the MRT, 1min walk to food market, 2min walk to Buggis market , 20min walk to Clarke Quay..... Let's say low price for a good location.",,,

No vacancy during my 5 day stay.","We traveled to San Diego on vacation with two adults and a toddler (18 month old). We were looking for something on the beach near Mission Bay or Pacific Beach but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. We stayed in Diamond Head for about 3 nights. For our price we had a suite that included a kitchen, living room, and separate bedroom. I'd say the pros are the price and the location. For the price the room is very big and we loved the separate living room and bedroom so that when the baby went to sleep we could still be out in the living room with the lights on and such. Also, the hotel was very family friend and provided a pack-n-play type crib which was already set up when we checked in. The location is just amazing. You are steps from the beach and boardwalk and walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops. We did not have any problem with parking and though we didn't use our car much, when we did we never had too much problem finding a space right in front of the hotel. The biggest downside is that the rooms are a little dated and just not that fresh feeling. I wouldn't say it was horrible or unclear necessarily, but the couch in the living room has seen better days and when we checked in I found pieces of peanuts on the carpet. Also the bathroom is fine but small and the room we were in the toilet seat lid was permanently open since the counter top was sitting on top of the lid. Not a huge deal but with an active and curious toddler it was one more thing to remember. The bed was fine but a little saggy in the middle. I'd say overall the strengths are the price and location. The rooms are clean and functional and a nice place to launch your vacation. We: 2 families with adult children We were friendly received by the front desk staff. Here we got in the morning also coffee and muffins for breakfast. Groundfloor Room: Beautifully decorated rooms with a nice kitchen and dining table. The kitchen is equipped with two cooking ranges and several pots and pans. There is a fridge and a big Microwave, plates, cuttleries, a toaster and a coffe maker, etc. The adjacent living room has a sofabed. The bedroom is also stylish decorated. It has 2 large windows facing public walk paths and therefore we couldn't open the shutters. Only one bedside light was working, their was no plug for the second light! The bath room is nice however the tub has a few rusty stains... But the only real downside: Very expensive WiFi, which frequently disconnects and asks for registration over and over again.

The room has all you need, we had a queen bed, kitchenette with eat in area and bathroom with a large closet. Everything was in good condition except for the carpet, I think that should probably be replaced in the next year or so just to give the place a nice new look. Our only complaint was the walls are very thin, you can hear people beside, outside and right on top of you, when booking I would ask for the quietest room, maybe on the top floor? The front desk was great, they let us check-in early and check-out late and were very helpful about it. The location is great, you only need to walk a minute to get to Pacific Beach, a walk down the boardwalk will take you Mission Beach, a bunch of restaurants and a fun fair. I really liked the hotel itself. I have stayed there at least three times before and have been satisfied. HOWEVER, they lied to me twice about the price of the stay. I called to add a one nights stay and was told it would not cost anything extra because I had Triple AAA. When I got there they said that person was NEW but didn't even suggest a compromise for the extra nights stay. THEN I had to check out early and apparently the same NEW person ran my credit card for one amount minus the one nights stay which I thought was their compromise. I was not told there would be an extra charge on my credit card for that night. When I got home they charged the extra amount. I think this is very POOR customer service. Diamond Head Inn was a nice surprise for the money. Right on the beach (boardwalk), clean, relatively quiet, and close to a lot of restaurants. Parking is a problem, and like another reviewer the gal in the office moved her car so we could park by the building. No free internet, and no computer to use in the office. Continental breakfast is just ""stand up"" or ""take-out"" coffee and muffins. Good stay, great time!!!! We were upgraded to an oceanfront room which I definitely recommend highly. The location is great although parking could be an issue. However, the young lady at the hotel desk found us parking and even moved her own car so we could park. The rooms are ok...your typical run of the mill accommodations. they do have full kitchens which is nice. This hotel was beyond our expectations! We travelled with our two kids and booked a suite. The staff was very helpful and kind. The beach is right there. Our room had a kitchenette which was convenient for making breakfast for the family. The beach is gorgeous and the weather was great!! This hotel is very close to restaurants and shops. I am definitely coming back here again when I come to San Diego!! i was very impressed by the great location of the hotel.The front desk people are very kind&eager to please.The rooms are very clean&up to date.The hotel is located a few feet away from the boardwalk so you don't need to wear your shoes to get to the beach.I definitely enjoyed my stay&I will be back many times. I stayed ten days at this hotel and enjoyed every one of them. The room is clean, updated, spacious, and very convenient with a kitchen included. It is not a glamorous hotel, but it is unexpectedly nice for the price. Parking is limited, but I only had to park a block away three times in ten days. If you want a clean, safe, quiet, friendly hotel right on the beach, this place can't be beat. The hotel staff is friendly and efficient, which added to my enjoyment. This will be my first choice to stay next time I am in San Diego and I will be sure to bring the family. This is the best little Inn I have ever stayed in. Me and my wife had so much fun staying here so close to the beach, clubs and an endless supply of places to eat. I plan on coming back to the PB often and will most likely always stay here. When I arrived there was absolutely nowhere to park. I was told by the registration desk person that there are only four parking spaces for the hotel, and the rest is first come first served. She invited me to park at the sister facility several blocks away and haul my luggage back across town. I drove around until a parking place came open. The room was very nice but there was no view at all. Right across the very small hall (?) a couple of young women were staying and they were in and out, talking on the phone outside and pounding on doors and slamming doors all night long - until 4:30 a.m. Called the front desk to see if anybody could get them to quiet down and nobody answered the phone. I liked the location and the room but the rest of it was not worth the $149 I paid for it.",,,
J J,73743,"This hotel is located very near to St Marks, we received a detailed email from the hotel with clear directions on how to find it so it was very easy. The room was great and detailed with Venetian style, rooms were clean and bathroom was very nice (albeit a bit difficult to get in and out of the shower/bath due to a strange layout) Breakfast was good, simple with pastries, coffee, bread. The staff were very friendly and helpful - lovely stay. Have stayed at this location several times in the past during Phoenix Bike Week......NEVER AGAIN! Property had turned into a dump....broken dryers and washing machines piled in back side of property, rooms were NOT CLEAN.....knew the sheets in our room were previously slept on w/out being changed. Dirty carpet, no refrigerator, no microwave ......had to ask for a refrigerator to be delivered and was asked ""why, do you need one?"". Toilets not cleaned, no light in bathroom....had to call to have that replaced also. Electrical plugs did not work. Watched maid ""cleaning"" (I use the word lightly) rooms the day we checked out, never saw dirty sheets come out of rooms and the vaccum NEVER came off her cart. Two nights cost us $184.......when we checked out, we advised of conditions.....they didn't care and didn't want to hear it.........$184 for two night in HELL! After reading such good reviews on this hotel, I booked it and was expecting perhaps more than I should. Very good location, modern tasteful decor and nice and clean. Big drawback is (actually this I subsequently found out, as one always do, this has been mentioned by other reviews) the room is not sound proof at all. I could clearly hear my next door neighbors having a great time laughing and chatting in the middle of the night. As a result, we have to constantly remind ourselves to speak in whisper. Next drawback is the hot water in the bath room is not that hot sometimes (sometimes it's okay). We tried to get hotel staff to fix it but they seem to think it's hot enough! Air-condition cannot go past 23 degrees, which for us was a bit cold because my hubby wasn't feeling too well and we ended up having to turn it off completely from time to time. Lastly, there's no free bottled water. We got to the hotel about 8 pm after driving all day. We were just going to find a place to park ourselves, but we were so tired we chose the valet service. They were a little slow getting it off of the street, but that wasn't a big deal. Our room was nice, had a great view, and was very clean. We called the front desk for some extra towels the second day and housekeeping had them up to our room very quickly. The hotel was in walking distance of many things we wanted to see. I'm not really understanding some of the reviews I've read about the small rooms. We had a deluxe queen room and it was just fine. The only thing that I wished was different was it would be nice to have another mirror in the room. There was just one in the bathroom over the sink and when two women share a room, that's just not enough. :) I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again. The Service was excellent here and very accommodating - however I am not a difficult person; I can only imagine the awful behavior the staff here must encounter. The clientel is a bit much, and the thought the spaces are well planned and finished - I resented being manipulated by Phillipe Stark design form lobby to room. The pool deck is nice but very cramped with stangers sharing a chair with no space between. The guest room was like a Gucci showroom - all bronzed mirrors and grey carpet - lovely and over the top luxury. The shower is a porno shower completely clad in mirror and well rather fun... If you engage with the staff they will be very kind and polite. Worth cashing in all my travel points to stay for free. Drinks are crazy expensive.","Have stayed at this location several times in the past during Phoenix Bike Week......NEVER AGAIN!

Carpet was FILTHY, hadn't been vacuumed, the light in the bathroom was burnt out. When they replaced the light, that is when I noticed the toilet hadn't been cleaned properly. The shower didn't just drip, it RAN all night, and you couldn't shut it off. However, the only part of renovation that hit this room, was the bathroom, and they didn't even finish it properly.(gaskets to stop the leaking) The bedspread was nasty and dirty. The bed was very uncomfortable-hard as a rock. There was no iron, and just as well, because the cover on the board was disgusting. Trying to find a plug in the room was treasure hunt. When I did find one,I worried that it might cause a fire if the plug was used.The response from the front desk with a complaint was practically none existent. We had stayed in this hotel several years ago and had a wonderful experience. NEVER again. I recommend the fire marshal go check this place out. Aside from the bad side of town where this hotel is located, the obnoxiously rude staff, the offensive odor of manure in the hallways, the difficulty of opening an obviously non-serviceable door to our room, dirty carpets, sticky fingerprints on phones, remotes for two TV's nowhere in sight (not to mention the staff's unwillingness to remedy the problem), dirty bathtub, broken screen door to the balcony, missing vents on outdated AC/heater unit, missing smoke detectors, hair on pillow cases, stiff mattresses, constant scent of ashtrays in room...where am I going with this? I haven't found anything positive to say about this family suite and I've only been here one hour. Maybe I'll go to sleep, wake up & discover this has all been a terrible dream...wishful thinking. I can only hope that they make up for this terrible experience with a wonderful continental breakfast. Please don't make the same mistake I made...listen to the reviews, save your money, and go elsewhere. If I can keep one person from going through the torture my family has endured, I will have not gone through this horrendous experience in vain. Don,t know her name,but the heavy set gal,at front desk,was the rudest person,ive met so far.room was dirty,the door to my room didnt lock right,you could just push door,and it would open.,i worried about getting robbed all night!and i itched all night,bedbuggs is right!never again,nightmare. Don't listen to anything these other people are saying... this hotel is great. It provides free WI-FI and free breakfast, which was descent. The service was good and efficient. Every time I called for room service from""Door to Door"" catering, I got my request very fast and I never had any trouble with the employees. The atmosphere of the room is comfortable and clean. The pool area is peaceful and the pool was perfect. It is a nice location and I felt safe. My night sleep was relaxing and I didn't hear any outside noises. I highly recomend this hotel to anyone and everyone!!!! The day staff was not as nice as the night staff. The free breakfast was nice, but stopped serving at 9 and they have eggs, but no meat, which I found odd. It appears that there are some people that must live on the property because I walked by a room one evening that had a flat screen tv in it and a sofa and the guy stood outside the room smoking and watching tv through the window. We got a good weekly rate, but we were staying with our two children and they gave us a very tiny room. The desk chair would block everyone's way to the bathroom. We were in a non smoking room, but our blankets had cigarette holes, and my husband laid down on the floor to find one of our daughters toys and found an old bracelet and a tupperware dish under the dresser. Housekeeping was very efficient and had to work around the playpen we had to buy because the hotel did not have one as advertised. We offered to let them have the one we bought for a discount, but they did not bite, so we donated it. All in all, it was not the worst place I have ever stayed, but I probably won't stay there again. It is obvious that they had redone the bathrooms. They were pretty nice. Front desk staff was on the verge of unfriendly at check in (night staff was very nice). Room was not cleaned properly (dirty plastic spoons on floor). Towels provided were old and uncomfortable. They were also very small - barely bigger than a kitchen towel. It was nearly impossible to get the key card to work to open room door. The breakfast was a joke - eggs were almost raw, waffle maker was dirty, juice was watered down and when I asked for water to drink I was told there was none available! The pool was clean but a lot of the poolside chairs were broken. Water was over chlorinated and very cold It is a run down large, old motel with poor service and everything smells, looks and is cheap. Would be worth no more than U$30-35.00 a day. For this rate go for Comfort Inn Scottsdale which is way under-priced compared to this motel. The reviews on this hotel are right on the money. We didn't see any homeless sleeping on the walks but I did see high security at the walmart right behind the hotel. It was to late to back out. Had I gonr to walmart first I would not of stayed. If you have kids I would avoid all together. This was the first place that I have ever stayed that I was concerned for the safety of myself and everyone else that was in our travel party. First of all DO NOT trust the pictures that you see on their website. The rooms may have the same headboards and set up, but they do not resemble anything close to what they show! Our Alarm clock was unplugged because it kept falling out of the broken socket, showed no time, yet still went off at 7am every morning. The good news about the alarm clock was that I was already up from a combination of different disturbances every night!!!! Whether it be some hoodlum screaming at the top of his lungs to some other hoodlum or some child screaming, or someone blasting their car stereo so loud that I thought I had head phones on. All of that would start at about sun down and go to about 4am. Ohh and the laundry... Hopefully, you don't have to do any because it is always full and I almost got assaulted because I moved some guys stuff out of the washer that had been their all day. I am pretty sure that a lot of the people staying at this hotel actually live there. For all of the activity I did not really see or hear any police... maybe they have given up on that area.",,,
neil r,2061363,"Having read other reviews, I feared the hotel would be dirty. It was not. The room was clean and looked reasonable, but the mattress had seen better days -or at least if it hadn't, it had no right to be a mattress. It dipped in the middle and I spent the night clinging to the side. Also, the hotel appears to be built pretty well on the runway of the airport. Convenient, but terrifying when planes come past the window. They're so close, you feel it's 'Hotel 9 11'. Not restful. The staff were pleasant and helpful, and at ÃÂ£79 a night it was the cheapest I could find in london - which is an absurd state of affairs in itself. Not the worst experience by any stretch, but check the mattress first. the reason I booked this hotel was because I was told by there staff both the toll free main line and there cleaning staff that it was clothing optional well they let you go nude till someone prud complains it is not right that the non nudist wins if people dont like it why do they go to a hotlel like this and key west is a place for open minded people but as allways there are people who spend there time telling others how to live I say stay home and dont try to tell me to beleve the way you do The Silk House is a tall, late eighteenth century building at the end of a street of little terrace houses. It's quite a distance from Hackney Central, but very well placed for Homerton overland rail station - just two minutes walk, and that will take you into central London. The bad points first: The decor is desperately in need of work. It's a listed building, and apparently it's difficultt o get permission to do anything with it - but think flaking woodchip walls, dreadful thin velvet-like flock carpets and very tatty fixtures. Some of the walls seem to be paper thin. You can hear noise through many of them, and the place seems absurdly hot as you mount the stairs. ok so that all sounds awful. However, I had two really good nights sleep. the building itself was an extremely elegant one in its dday, and the original georgian spiral stair case and some original features remain. My room was on the top floor (there is a lift) and was large if sparcely furnished. My bed, however, was comfortable, spotlessly clean and had a good, thick duvet. Bathrooms are shared, and somewhat remeniscent of 60s boarding houses, but there is at least a proper bath and the room was of excellent proportions. The service manager at reception (which is open 24 hours) is extremely friendly. He knows the limitation of the place, but it was only around Â£35 a night and in london, that's extremely good value. Also, there is free wi fi. To conclude. If you're not bothered about luxury, and you don't mind the smell of cooking which inexplicably (as no one is cooking here) pervades the staircase as you mount, this is quite a find for its convenience and space. If they ever do it up properly, it would be really good, but then it would probably go up in price too.","The Silk House is a tall, late eighteenth century building at the end of a street of little terrace houses.

I had booked in to a place called 'The Silkhouse' yet this name was nowhere to be found. The building is dingy and tired. Staff were welcoming but old fashioned key to door which you have to use to lock yourself in to the room was a bad start... things got worse... no curtains on windows in room and the bed and linen appeared 'faded' (I am being generous. T.V. not working and no bedside light... just rather dirty overhead light. Showerroom was recently and very badly painted (Masking tape still in evidence) The shower didi not fit into the brachet and more worrying the extractor fan did not work, (I heard someone spray air freshener right outside bedroom door) All in all a dreadful place and not worth 50 pounds sterling - more a third rate hostel - avoid at all costs! About 400m from the nearest tube down a long terraced road, this hotel is more of a hostel for migrant workers and travelling students. Facilities are shared and my room had a window with bars and the window itself was held shut with a brick. Noise between rooms travelled easily and the whole place is generally run down. Would be a good business venture to do it up for the Olympics! yhe only good thing is pretty good location and the price for London, the rest is .... dirty mouldy old shared bathrooms ... old fashioned dusty rooms. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Next time better to spend more money than stay in the room you want to run away from, sad but real! We wanted a hotel for a short one night stay in london close to the o2 arena for a gig we were attending. Firstly we were very concerned about the area the hotel was in and would not recommend it for that! Next of all the hotel was nothing like the photos we saw online- it was a very nice building,however so run down and very very basic. We were taken to our room and greeted with a blast of cold air as the windows were wide open, we had no promised en-suite bathroom, instead a damp, dirty communal bath and toilet and the wardrobe doors were all hanging off their hinges. The room and hotel design were all very outdated. But on a more positive note the bed was clean and comfortable, we had a nice tv, the staff were very kind and friendly and at least it was close to the tube station! A bargain price but very un desirable, deffinatly not a luxurious stay!! Glad we were only there for one night!",,,
GMBAIG,309914,"Very good place and near to bus station, metro train and the famous Mustafa centre. South asian will enjoying to live at this place all local foods of south asian are available and a Masjid for the Muslims for prayer. As far as Hotel, it is good, nice and clean with restaurant. So, it is worth to stay here with this budget. Excellent hotel perhaps appartment to stay with family, every thing is available within your room (to eat, to cook, to wash, to iron & etc.). near to bur dubai shopping area (mina bazar or adjacent market) and metro station. if you want to stay in bur dubai area then it is excellent place.","clean and budget hotel just in the Little India area .famous Mustafa market is just 5 minutes.Metro rail station is 10 minutes walk.Hop on hop off tour buses and bus station is very near just at mustafa market.Cheap indian food is available in the area.Nice to stay here.Tea/coffe maker in the room Very good place and near to bus station, metro train and the famous Mustafa centre. South asian will enjoying to live at this place all local foods of south asian are available and a Masjid for the Muslims for prayer. As far as Hotel, it is good, nice and clean with restaurant. So, it is worth to stay here with this budget. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Its a budget hotel in Little India part of Singapore. Its greatest strength is that it is walking distance from Mustafa Shopping Centre from where most of the shopping is done. Also it is very close to roadside Indian restaurants which are again budget category. So Indian food is abundantly available. There is Indian restaurant in the hotel itself. The location is bit untidy but very well connected to all parts of Singapore. There is a famous Indian temple also at some distance. Taxi is available at the gate of the hotel very easily. Rooms are comfortable and service is good. They provide all the facilities in the room like fridge, kettle, clothing iron etc. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and specially to Indian travelers. Stay here for 3 nights last week of Dec 2011. Staff is good and rooms are also quite compared to what ppl say in trip advisor. Room service was also upto the mark. And location is little india is also excellent. So worth staying in this hotel if u wanna stay in little india. Bathroom are also clean n neat. Rooms are not so spacious but still good enough. They also provide locker in every rooms. stayed here for 3 nights, its a decent hotel, chinese run, rooms although small are value in this expensive city. there is good connectivity, the buses are 20 feet away and the little india and fare mrt are a short walk. excellent location i beleive. there is good food and shopping available close by and the small lanes and alleys are open till late. good expereince. This hotel worked out cheapest and most handy for public transport in Singapore where most hotels are so expensive. We are used to Indian standards, so the rooms were fine, aircon, hot water, comfy beds, little sound proofing, poor finish and a friendly lizard on the window. Lovely cafes at the front to get breakfast and great indian meals, including plenty veggie options. Handy to Farrer Park MRT. I was glad I booked this one, as the area has a really nice feel to it and it did everything we wanted it to do. Hotel was quite cheap in heart of Little India right next to the temple. Its quite close to the MRT station and almost could say in the heart of the city. There are other better budget hotels too but most of them would fall in the red light district so this would be a little better option. Around the hotel there are lot of cheap food joints where they serve you Indian food. But those are cheap joints for good quality Indian Food prefer to go to Boat Quay. Rooms are surprisingly big with big wondow overlooking city and bathrooms are pretty big too again with big size windows Basically it is a 2 star hotel but compared to what I paid and going by its location which is next to Little India and Mustafa Center, I must say it is the best bet Cons: Rooms are very noisy as the hotel is next to Seragoon Road with vehicles plying 24 hours. Carpets of the hotel are very old. There are many eateries at stone throw away from the hotel. Not ideal for remance A very basic hotel in the city center near to the famous shopping Mustaffa shopping mall and SIM LIM square walking distance to the underground metro.The hotel has two restaurants serving good Indian food . This hotel located in heart of little india.Location is awesome.But the service is not upto the mark.For me the TV wasnt working properly when i asked them for repair it took a long for them to respond.AC was not working.When i got some call from my local friends when im not in my room they didnt care about informing me.Later i found when i call them. 1. Convenient location 2. Value for money 3. Well designed rooms 4. Adequate amenities/facilities We are from Australia and we chose this hotel because of cost factors. I think we were the only Anglo Saxon people in the hotel. Singapore is very expensive and this was one of the cheapest places plus we wanted the location of not being in the centre of the Western section of Singapore. We stayed there for 7 nights. Well, we certainly got culture. We loved that aspect of it observing the Indian people and eating the food and being part of the atmosphere. The hotel itself was quite grubby but adequate. The beds were comfortable and felt clean (just the carpet ) and the shower was good and basically we left the hotel at 8 in the morning and didn't return until 8 or 9 in the evenings just to sleep so it served its purpose. Cheap shopping and lots of good food. Close to Little India train station which we used every day. Tried the buses but they weren't as efficient. Staff were friendly to us but didn't give out accurate information. So do your own research and don't rely on their information cos invariably they were wrong. We nearly missed the Night SÃ¤fari due to their inaccurate information. Air conditioning worked well except for the lack of free wifi. They charged you $5 for 2 hours which was ridiculously high. Or $1 for half and hour on their computers downstairs. My teenage son and daughter were okay with this hotel. If you want a cheap place to stay in a good location and you don't plan to spend too much time there; just simply sleep then it is fine. It served us well for what we wanted. The hotelâs main plus point is its location. It is situated in Little India area near Mustafa market. The Ferrer Park MRT station is also just a few minutes walk from here. Hotel does not have its own restaurant. But, Indian food is available in nearby restaurants. Overall it is a hotel for the tourists with economy budget and also for the Indians who starve for Indian food. Hotel is situated in good location on main road in Little India, you can go by foot to colonial district its about 20 mins walk or you can take a cab.Breakfast is in the reastaurant next the hotel, food si Good and tasty. Rooms are small and basic. For the price i was satisfied. For one max. two nights its ideal. I regret staying in this hotel. rooms were filthy. service poor. the only good thing about this hotel is its location. located next to Mustafa and MRT station it can be considered for Indian travellers. but a big NO otherwise. breakfast was included but wasn't worth giving a shot. all in all avoid it if you can. the Park on Kitchner road nearby is rather a good option but you'll have to loosen your purse strings. one of the mpst cost effective hotel in little india. its very close to Mustafa. The room in whichi stayed was very spacious. they have an internet cafe but you have to pay for using it. I didnt tried the food there but there was many good options near by. Had just been to Singapore and stayed 4 nights in Hotel Broadway. This is a good hotel for Indians, given the fact that it is 3-4 minutes walk from mustafa and this hotel is right in the middle of little india. MRT(Farrer-Park) is just 3-4 minutes walk and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel. Delhi Restraunt and Amber restraunt at the ground floor of this hotel provides good north indian food, and there are tonnes of other indian food options in the vicinity(anand bhaban, komalas and shakuntala's to name a few). Given all these plus points in terms of location, the hotel rooms are a shade untidy, the carpet needs cleaning, the bathrooms are small, and the reception is not not overly helpful(they will just respond to what you ask and not more). But who cares, if you are in singapore for vaccation this is a good hotel to spend your nights, go shopping in mustafa and do sighseeing during the day. I would recommend this to ""budget conscious Indian traveller"" For about 100 SGD, the rooms were some ancient caves, small windows, old funritures, TV channels all hazy & blurred. The staff at reception were some disinterested characters & very rude. Only good thing is it is bang opposite to Mohd Mustafa the shopping centre & some Indian Restaurants Location is good splly for indians but very unfriendly staff splly the chinese ones at reception during day. Rooms are small.. I paid for an extra bed and it was just a foldable one with different blankets than normal beds. When I asked for normal blanket I was told extra bed can only have those netted blankets. Like its written in Singapore constitution. Some lights were not working and one electrical socket was also not working. CRT TV with less channels and poor reception - doesn't matter tho' u wont go to Singapore to watch TV. No free Wifi in room.. have to pay to use pc in the hotel $1 for 30 mins. Better use the cafe outside $1.5 for an hour which stays open 24 hrs. If compared to other budget hotels I guess this works out tho. Clean, pleasant and well located both for the colourful Little India district and the city centre, the Broadway Hotel was a perfect bolt hole for our stay in Singapore. The friendly and helpful staff made our stay very comfortable. With decent sized rooms that won't break bank, the Broadway is the ideal budget hotel. HIghly recommended. This hotel is best for budget travelers as this gives best of connectivity of MRT mustafa sim lim bugis etc etc.. great hotel at gr8 price.",,,
podettski,260685,"Stayed here for a week. Staff couldn't be nicer. Got a big room which was cleaned daily. As it was September nothing else in the hotel was open including pool at weekends. Restaurant was also closed. There was free wi-fi in the lobby but wi-fi is chargeable in your room. The hotel is not in town but is a 15 min walk to the train station and main area. I didn't see a nicer hotel in Mataro and you are a 15 min walk from the biggest beach in the town. It is in a quiet area so got a good sleep. Stayed here for 5 nights. The rooms were clean and well equiped (iron, phone, tv, hairdryer, safe). The location is really great, good subway options and shopping nearby. The doubles are small, so 3 in a room is too tight. For the price its a good option, to stay in such a great location, as space in NY is always at a premium. Staff couldn't be more helpful and the rooms were serviced daily. Aircon was cold but hard to regulate. Wi-fi just introduced. Stayed here for 5 nights. The rooms were clean and well equiped (iron, phone, tv, hairdryer, safe).

Wi-fi just introduced.","friendly staff, nice hotel room, very good beds, private parking garage, very good breakfastbuffet, near the centre, near the railway station, I stayed at the hotel several times during the last 4 years, for work reasons. It is located some 40 from Barcelona, by car. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the rooms are a good size. Good buffet breakfast, but limited evening meals in the bar. Even so they were individually well cooked. Staff is friendly and donÂ´t worry about parking your car because there is places available on the streets nearby. Avoid, during the summer, the duplex rooms on the fourth floor, they are too hot. My wife and I stayed at the hotel for three nights in October 2011. It is located some 10 mins from the train station with regular trains into the centre of Barcelona. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the rooms are a good size. Good buffet breakfast, but limited evening meals in the bar. Even so they were individually well cooked. Staff were very friendly and helpful with ideas for our two days in Barcelona and when we reported a problem with the battery for the safe it was changed whilst we ate our breakfast. In house garage at a reasonable cost with free street parking. Stayed here for a week. Staff couldn't be nicer. Got a big room which was cleaned daily.

Last train is at 00h15 from Place Catalunya if you want to come back this way. I would recommend something closer. Also the staff was unfriendly and not helpful, this may not seem important now but it can make a difference when you get there and have a bunch of questions to ask them about where to go or find a good restaurant, etc... Arrived at this hotel after ten hour drive from paris on a sunday tired and hungry delighted to find that despite no mention on hotel website there is no food or dri nk available at the weekend not even a cup of coffee or a beer only chap in hotel on reception offered to phone pizza place we agreed big mistake absolutely disgusting. Sewage smell in upstairs corridors shame really because the room was ok and the breakfast the following morning was ok unfortunately this couldnt make up for the total lack of service on arrival the previous night it says hotel over the door for goodness sake This hotel is a good location for people who are in Mataro on business travel. Located right in the centre you can reach the hotel very quickly by car coming of the near by dual carriage way. A walk to the beach is only about 10 minutes away and therefore very pleasant if you intend to get a cold beer at one of the numerous restaurants and bars by the sea side. THe hotel also has a small pool and a gym which allows you to keep fit during your travels. I enjoyed my short stay. THanks Located on a commuter rail line this spot offers the joys of a smaller town with easy rail access to Barcelona. 40 minutes travel; 6 Euros return. Many restaurants; clean beaches and a chance to laze about with the locals in the plazas. Staff fluent in English Excellent hotel, service just wonderful; staff couldn't do enough to help us. About 45 minutes in train from centre of Barcelona; just 3 Euros return, excellent value.",,,
eriu31,649764,"First off, you will be landing in a shady looking neighborhood. There is no obvious way to reach the hotel unless you drive against traffic or use the bus lane. I booked a king bed room through hotels.com. When I arrived, two hours after check-in time, it was not ready. I sat around in the lobby for a bit. When I got it, I was surprised to find I got a two full beds room. I called front desk about it, to no avail. Since I had booked online, I had no claim. The girl at the front desk asked me to bring a copy of my reservation so she could read it to me. Surely enough, this was an additional humilliation I did not want, so I sucked it up and asked for nothing else. If you are staying here, know there is no parking for your car, no hot water in your faucet, no coffemaker; and although there is a microwave and a small fridge you will not find mugs, plates or even a spoon, so bring your own. There are a lot of nice places to eat within walking distance. Be careful if walking around late, there is quite a few unoccupied buildings around the block. I stayed for just a night. The hotel is clean and free of offensive odors. There is a night watchman although the hotel seems to be in a a nice neighborhood; that made me feel safe. I came in late for check in, and the watchman was nice to help me find a parking spot near the lobby's entrance. As for the frontdesk clerk, he was merely laconic.There were snack vending machines right next to the elevator. The room was better than expected. My room had a wonderful view of the coast and a little balcony. Coffemaker, coffee, fridge, mugs, glasses were clean as was the bathroom. I cannot say the same for the beds, as one of them looked like it had not been changed into clean sheets, it smelled a little too; the other bed was fine. A nice amenity I must mention is the complimentary breakfast which includes food for all tastes. I was very comfortable over all.","I stayed for just a night.

A nice amenity I must mention is the complimentary breakfast which includes food for all tastes. I was very comfortable over all. This hotel was a good choice simply because there is very little in the way of accommodation in the area. Beds were comfortable and the room was spacious, included a small desk, vanity with chair, and good lighting. Our room had two regular sized or full sized beds. I am uncertain if there are rooms with queen or king size beds available. Also Included in the room were a microwave and mini-fridge. The breakfast was self serve and satisfactory for us. The previous evening snacks, beer, and wine were available gratis from 17:00 to 19:00. They offer a modest US$5 senior discount but you need to ask. Good proximity to the Arecibo Observatory and the Rio Camuy Caves. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We travel to Puerto Rico pretty regularly, and normally stay closer to Old San Juan/metropolitan area, but we were going to a wedding in Camuy, and it was just more convenient to be close by the nights before and of the event. It was a fantastic hotel for the price - we had a fridge (NOT a minibar, an actual regular little fridge), which was great to have some cold beer available in the room for downtime and getting ready. There was also a microwave which was super handy when we wanted a light midnight snack of popcorn the night before the wedding :) The desk staff we encountered were all very friendly, super helpful and spoke both Spanish and English fluently and happily. Folks who wrote negative comments in their reviews regarding the fast food joints and the graffitied adjacent building...sounds like either a bit snobbish or just not too familiar with the island. When you're on a main strip, the abundance of fast food places is everywhere, and once you skip a few blocks down to the beach, you never even know they are there. Our room had an ocean view, and I personally thought the graffitied building off to the right added a bit of character. Bottom line, for the great service, comfort, cleanliness and convenience of the room and the very reasonable price, I'd definitely stay here again if I needed to be in this vicinity of the island. On a past trip we visited the caverns with our at the time 3 year old daughter, and I definitely would have grabbed a night in this hotel for convenience sake rather than trooping back and forth in one day in the car with a little kid. We stayed here in December for two nights. We selected it for proximity to the caves and the observatory. The hotel is located on a frontage road behind a Burger King and other fast food places. Although there is a nice view of the sea from the back, there is also a graffiti-scarred building which mars the scene. It is in a tacky area. The rooms are okay and so is the breakfast. However, the main problem with this hotel is the fourth restaurant/banquet hall which is frequently used for parties. If you are any of the floors on that side of the hotel, you will not be able to sleep a wink. We saw a guy in the elevator bringing up mega speakers that afternoon. From 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., the music was so loud that our walls shook. Earplugs do not work here! We were on the third floor and party hearty revellers were even in the stairwell and down the halls, adding to the noise. The hotel's priorities are clearly with renting out their banquet hall rather than to their overnight guests. The next morning when we asked to speak to the manager, the unsympathetic and curt receptionist said, ""Why do you want to speak to the manager? she already knows about it."" The staff at this hotel is rigid and the customer service is poor. I stayed at this hotel because it was close to my family. Overall the experience was good, though there was one male receptionist who seemed to not care much about the guests. Only one drink and ice machine in the whole hotel. We lost money in the machine and when my son told the guy we wanted drinks, he told my son burger king is open 24 hours. Not good service at all. Our TV was broken and the same guy told my fiance we could change rooms. REally? I was gonna change rooms at 11pm wit my 6 yr old daughter sleeping already. The rest of the staff was great thought. Angie was there the next day and we told her about what happened the night before. She apologized, gave us complimentary drinks for all of us and got our TV fixed. I would recommend this hotel but hopefully that male receptionist is not there when you go. The hotel is very quiet which I loved because you don't have the hustle and bustle of alot of people all day. We had the pool to ourselves every day. My daughter loved it. I would go back there again. We booked this hotel when exploring the north side of the island. Check in was quick and staff were very friendly. We were impressed with the size of our room. We recommend you get a room with an ocean view. It was beautiful to see the sunset sitting on the balcony. There were huge waves on the beach which you can see from the room. Everything was neatly placed and clean. This location is a good option if you're travelling to Arecibo, Aguadilla, Rincon or any other nearby municipality. The hotel has easy access to Route 2. There are a few restaurants in the area, although the hotel also has one. WOW what a pleasant surprise this place was. Arrived a bit early, they tried to accommodate us earlier but we decided to head out to the Observatory in Arecibo. Must go and see. We had some items needed to be kept frozen they took care of it while we went scouting the towns. Spacious room, great friendly staff, great shower, excellent restaurant please try the lamb great mojitos and pina coladas. The view if you just look straight the beach waves will capture you totally. This is a place we would definitely come back to and recommend to our friends. I stayed at Hotel Rosa del Mar with my sister for 2 nights in April, the location of the hotel is close to Arecibo, located in Hatillo. We stayed here to be at closer proxmity to family members. This hotel itself was clean, very nice staff. They had a restaurant, but my sister and I did not have the opportunity to use it, although one of the nights there was a Boxing event and they gave us passes to go up and enjoy drinks and to watch the fight. That night there was a lot of activity, people having a good time. Close to the hotel there is a Burger King and other fast food places. If one wants to see San Juan they better have a car, it's a good hour drive AT LEAST. As almost all hotels in PR are expensive during the high season, I had to limit my expectations for the price. This place was at least par for the course. The bar/restaurant at the top seemed to be pretty happening; and you get nice views of the ocean (if facing that way).",,,

It seems to be in the middle of the city (a bit to the right of the center) and it's a wonderful location as many train stops to tourist attractions are only three or four away. There were four types of transportation (I'm lying. There were five, but I never looked for a bike): Tram, S-Bahn (train), U-Bahn (subway), and Bus. It's a perfect place for backpackers and the young. The elderly may have issues (they had lots of bunk beds. I'm not sure if they had other things. It's possible). The utilities were great. The staff were all smiles. They spoke German, English (quite well), and I'm not sure what else. Ask them about anything. There are things to do in the lobby (a seating area to chat with friends, a pool table, a bar, computer terminals that you could use for a small fee, etc). About the rooms. There were bunk beds (I didn't know this until I got there. I'm afraid of the top bunk). I don't remember seeing a speck of dust. I believe that, during my stay, I forgot what dust was. Everything was so clean that I could possibly eat off of whatever. Prices. I got a room for less than 100â¬ (really!) for three nights. That includes the room, the keycard (for the room), breakfast (which was wonderful) and tax. What that doesn't include is the 2â¬ laundry fee. I'm definitely recommending this hostel to others. Oh! Bring your own towel and toiletries. A great hostel for young people. I'd say it is definitely not suited for elder gentlemen and ladies, since it can get quiet noisy at night. But for younger couples, friends out travelling and college buddies - it is the place to stay at.

Toilets and shower rooms are also very tidy and comfortable. All in all, it's a great hostel, and the prices don't bite.:) Best regards from the Russians from Sweden ;)) Just stayed at Industriepalast, mid feb. Found the place to be very nice, the rooms aren't fancy but everything was very clean, and the bathroom/shower where excellent. The double bed was actually two single mattresses in a double bed frame, but it was very comfortable. The room also had a TV and a small wardrobe. I had read some Trip Advisor reviews that said the staff were very rude. I found the exact opposite. All the staff were very nice and extremely helpful. This hotel is also a hostel, with dorm rooms - i imagine the staff get a lot of requests from drunk groups and are probably rude to them(??). I found the hotel excellently located for getting around, particularly the east-side. It's situated right next to an S-Bahn and a U-Bahn, there's also a tram stop right outside. I'm planning on going back to Berlin - amazing city! - and will definitely stay at the Industriepalast again. Very nice and friendly place. Helpful and informative staff. Lot's of privacy, lovely clean minimalist rooms. No frills, just the basics. Right next to Warschauer Station with lots of transport choices; Metro, S-bahn and trams, O2 World, river Spree, East side gallery and Kreuzberg just across the bridge. Can highly recommed this place for a affordable, relaxed and easy stay in Berlin. I stayed in this hostel/hotel for 4 nights.Although my room (a double) was clean and comfortable,the service was terrible.The staff at reception were unfriendly and unhelpful-even a bit fascist.The last straw in terms of how low the standard I found there, was having a bottle of mineral water taken from my room!?To add to the overall atmosphere-The room overlooked the recycling dump for Friedrichshain (as do half the rooms in the hotel).I will never return there.. This is a pretty good hostel for 10 EUR a night, It was very clean, the bed were comfortable. The only real problems are the hidden costs, namely bedding which costs 2 EUR (not unreasonable but annoying) and that the internet isn't free and wouldn't function correctly in our room. Also the showers are the type where you push a button and it turns it's self off after a period of time, great for saving water but rather annoying when washing your hair/self. The locations pretty good, you can walk to bars in Kruzberg and there is an U-Bahn and an S-Bahn up the road, plus a tram. Also, breakfast costs 5 EUR which for Berlin is expensive, go to a bakery instead. I checked out this - brand new - operation for the first time last week. It was a breath of fresh air. I'd highly recommend it for any business traveler out there who may be looking for something new and different. None of the stuffiness of the old (especially west-) Berlin business classics. Helpful, no-nonsense staff, clean, brand-new rooms and good location (great link over to Kreuzberg and towards Ku'damm on the U1). Room rates are excellent. I'll certainly be back having seen almost every other business hotel in Berlin. Try it if you're fed up with the competition! If you're on holiday and need somewhere clean, decent and central with a different twist, don't miss it.",,,
Mark F,263964,"We spent Christmas and New Year in San Francisco and chose the Omni for our place to stay. From the moment we arrived (before we got out of the taxi) we were made incredibly welcome by Daryl the doorman. Our experience at check in was really personal and we were given our Select Guest beverage vouchers for our morning drink. My daughter was really pleased to see a Birthday cake in our room when we opened the door. This was arranged by the hotel and no charge made. The room was very clean an plenty of room for the three of us. The room service was always on time, and one time when it wasn't we were given some muffins as an apology! The maid service could not have been better either. The bar was cosy and friendly and like the restaurant a little pricy but quality food and drink. There is not one thing I can genuinely say I could remotely think about in a negative way. All the staff were a pleasure to speak to, the service was always excellent and the decor of the hotel was very seasonal. The Christmas tree and decorations and Christmas music in the lobby were welcoming and cosy. Frequent warm apple cider, apples and ginger cookies were a welcome treat each evening. We were made welcome and felt part of the family during our stay away from home over Christmas. I stay in many hotels in the UK as part of my work and I can honestly say that the Omni has been the most pleasurable hotel stay I have ever experienced. This may sound over the top but it's true. I would certainly use this hotel again if in San Francisco. I stayed here with two of my friends for three days. It has a really good location close to the Dam, and also it's quite cheap. The staff is also very friendly and good English-speaker, but these are all positive things about this Hostel. The rooms are overcrowded and not very clean, you have sleep with 5-7 people in a really small mixed room. Security is also very poor, there is no safety locker, you have to keep your belongings in your room, where people go in and out every time. Therefore it was not surprising, when during our sleep somebody has robbed us. If you have chosen this Hostel, You would mind your belongings, and stay in the Hostel as little as you can. All in all, I do not reccomend this Hostel. I have to admit to being seduced by the name of this hotel but I ound it quite misleading. My room was in the basement so natural light was poor at all times of the day. There was no air conditioning nor extractor fan in the bathroom, so the room was a bit of a sauna. If I opened the window it was very noisy. There was a fan supplied but it made such a racket that I had to switch it off during the night and so ended up trying to sleep while drenched in sweat. I don't know how it got a 4* rating and I wouldn't touch it again. I stayed at Candlewood Suites Phoenix for a total of 67 nights in early 2012 in a comfortable and spacious 1-bedroom suite. The property has lots of extras to make your stay great, from the no-cost laundry and business center, to the swimming pool and spa and BBQ area, to the small gym and on-site shopette. The rooms are spotless, well-designed, and comfy, and the staff genuinely does everything they can to assist their guests. Candlewood felt like home my entire stay.

The rooms are spotless, well-designed, and comfy, and the staff genuinely does everything they can to assist their guests. Candlewood felt like home my entire stay. We booked a quick mid-week preseason getaway to Ocean City in May, 2012. We stayed in room 809, which was a very large, spotless, king bed room with kitchenette and balcony overlooking the pool, boardwalk, and with direct views of the ocean. The room was comfortable and had nice touches, including good TV channels, an in-room safe, and nice toiletries. The bathroom was small but recently re-tiled, and the kitchenette had a 4-burner stove, full-size fridge, dishwasher, and settings for six. We loved sleeping with the sliding glass door open, listening to the waves crashing on the sand all night. Friendly staff. Hot tub and in-door pool. Fitness center. Free coffee. Some might say the hotel is older, but we saw it more as retro. Try a drink at the boardwalk-side cafe during happy hour. This is a well-maintained property, which is what I come to expect from Hilton. Nicely renovated rooms and the complex is great. The staff are very helpful and friendly. This hotel is located next to one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been too. We visited the Blu Aqua thanks to a Groupon offer introducing the hotel. We loved everything about the hotel (except the fact that the couch in our suite was very uncomfortable). We had a park view suite and enjoyed stepping out onto the balcony for some fresh air. The design of the rooms was quite unique, but very functional as well. The large flat screen TV's and free wi-fi were great additions as well. Aside from the magnificent room, however, the best part of our visit may have been the service. We spoke to the doorman, Bob, on several occasions and received many great tips and recomendations on nearby eateries and activities. The whole staff was very pleasant and attentive throughout our stay. The wall length firplace in the lobby is a site to see, along with the ""candle lit"" tables in the Filini Lounge. The workout area looked amazing, although we didn't have to to try it out. The parking cost is a bit high at $53/night, but not really out of line with Chicago standards. Our only other complaint, albeit a minor one, was with the minibar/fridge. We were warned by both the desk clerk and bellman that the items were actually on some type of timer. If an item was removed and later put back a charge would still show up on the bill. We were told it was easy enough to have them taken back off, but not really a hassle I wanted to go through at checkout. We had been hoping to chill some wine in the fridge, but didn't know how many items we would displace in the process! Overall though, the hotel was quite amazing and definitely a place we will return to in the future. This is a former private club that was has kept its historic charm, but is now a modern hotel in downtown Seattle. Convenient to light rail to the airport, sports venues and commercial district. Property is clean and well maintained. The problem is a lack of attention to detail. The gym equipment is limited and had the same maintenance issues as they did the last time I stayed here months ago. So, don't expect a fully equipped fitness center, but they will give you a pass to a nearby gym if you want to go out in the typical Seattle weather. Bill was incorrect (and another guest was complaining about the same issue), and the room's internet connection was improperly installed and apparently had been that way for quite some time. If management raises its game this could be an outstanding property, but unitil then it's a very good choice, but not up to Hilton's standards. Took my wife to the RBI for a few days of relaxing and golf for her birthday......What a treat! Everything (and I mean everything) about the stay was beyond excellent! The staff couldn't do enough for us, the golf course was challenging but fun, the food was outstanding, our premium room overlooking the 18th hole was perfect. We had planned to go to town for some meals and things, but never left the resort! We plan to visit regularly in the future. Thank you RBI for making our stay wonderful! Nice property downtown near city hall. Checked in mid afternoon needing a snack and self serve food area had lots of choices and made it easy (no waiting for room service). Staff was friendly and efficient. Liked the modern room with ease of use for business traveler looking to work. Good price point for larger room and good facilities. Right at the start of the Gaslamp district, this is an old character hotel with lots of charm. We stayed on the 5th floor where the carpets were a little dirty but the room was quite nice. There were lots of sirens which I suppose you would get at any downtown hotel. Took my wife to the RBI for a few days of relaxing and golf for her birthday......What a treat!

Easy to find, 5-10 min walk from the train station. Lovely helpful staff. Stayed in room 103 on the first floor ( thank god the stairs are steep! But to be expected in this type of building!) 4 bed private room. Lovely and clean - especially the bathroom! Beds were comfortable too. No sign of any mice but then we took notice of the signs and didn't take food into out room. Great location for access to Dam square/ red light district and other central locations. Always felt safe. Thank you for a good stay! My rating of excellent is in relation to the price paid and general expectations. It's a hostel. Don't expect the world but good value base for seeing the city! I stayed here with two of my friends for three days. It has a really good location close to the Dam, and also it's quite cheap.

Therefore it was not surprising, when during our sleep somebody has robbed us. If you have chosen this Hostel, You would mind your belongings, and stay in the Hostel as little as you can. All in all, I do not reccomend this Hostel. stayed here with three friends, after gettting of the train we headed down the road with friends looking for a cheap hotel for the week, as we had not booked in advance, everywhere was full we were getting a bit worried and bored, then we found this place 30 euros a nite, stairs very steep but thats just the way the buildings are roundhere, very clean with comfy beds, one of the first things he said was smoke as much as you want just open the window ! would return ! When we arrived there was a mix up with our card and apparently we had not paid for the hotel beforehand which we thought we had, the man on reception was not very helpful of empathetic even through my friend who had done the booking was very visibly upset about the mix up. After we got that sorted we eventually got up to the room, everyone is complaining about the stairs but they were fine, nothing worse than other hotels I have stayed at in Holland. The room was tiny, I am not sure how they managed to fit three bunk beds in the room but it was far too crowded for 6 people and was a bit of a challenge, we couldnt all stand up and once and it was a bit like playing musical chairs. The beds were comfy enough and the bedding was clean etc. The best thing about this hotel is the location, its good as a place just to crash but don't book here if you are planning on spending much time in your room or you are off for a romantic break! location was excellent. Close to everything!!!! helpful staff, Windows lookind on gothic Niewe Kerk! lockers and safe on the reception and Kitchen for free use on the ground floor. Free fast WI-FI! Supermarket neraby,i would recommend to stay there. My daughter and several friends on a semester abroad in London stayed at the Mevlana for a long weekend. I assume their stay was fine but my comment has to do with the kind compassion demonstrated by the management. Checking out in a rush, my daughter left her cell phone in the room. When she arrived in London, she phoned the Mevlana and spoke to the manager who went to her room, located her phone and promised to mail it to her. We were dubious to say the least. After a few kind, comforting emails back and forth from the manager, my daughter was reunited today with her cell phone, which of course contains her entire life (phone numbers, photos, calendar, etc.). The manager refused to be reimbursed for the overnight mail postage. The kindness displayed by the Mevlana restored my daughter's faith in humanity, and I believe deserves our strong recommendation. This is a great place for visiting students to stay. Thank you Mevlana! Im a guy staying in this hotel, and the first 2 days i' ve been quiet good. Well, I complain cause the chinese workers who are working here they try to make me pay every day more and more.... whatever.... What I complain about is that you are allowed to smoke, but is also you responsability to take care with the fire alarm. So if you are going to smoke better disconnect the fire alarm, otherwise the chinesse workers they will shout you and they will misstheat you like it hapenned to me.... And the last thing but also important is that the say every where they have free wifi in the hotel. THATS A LIE. It does not work and they don't give solutions. Arrived here after a fracas with Hotel Princess and it was satisfactory for our 3 day stay, Toilets/showers were not cleaned in 4 days so we took it in turns to clean it ourself, beds were never made/changed while we were there but 6 guy coming home drunk/stoned everynight didnt really care what state the bed was in to be honest. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with anything you asked them directions,sights,fresh towels etc. After reading a few reviews on here which say the rooms smell, we did at points in our stay all believe we could smell urine/feces but didnt know if this was because of our sobriety or we were just being silly, also noted on the site people complaining of rodents, i never once saw any mice/rats but i did have an encounter with their cat which is obviously used as a detterent. all in all i would recommend this hotel for its friendly staff and for being close to all main tourist attractions 3/5!! 1. We were constantly asking for the bill/invoice but just got promised every day (""next day"") so at the end we have not got any invoice...of course it might be better for the hostel management to avoid paying tax after our stay...That is why the case is going to be reported to different Dutch authorities and Police and the preliminary report has been signed by 6 visitors. 2. There were couple of rats in 2 of our rooms and the only thing that the Chinese hostel manager was willing to do was that ""his cat could check it""...No comment, he was absolutely serious...These Chinese owners' behavior was very far from European norms... 3. The toilet was incredible dirty every day (we spent 4 nights in the hostel). 4. The internet did not work on our floor, the Chinese was telling lies that he would check and repair it but never happened, of course... 5. The stairs were very narrow. 6. Basically everyone could easily get in to the hotel since you just have to ring the bell but no real face controll with identifying the person. 7. The location was good. 8. Some of us moved to another, nice hotel situated 200metres from this crappy one (because of the rats in the rooms) but the hostel manager was not willing to pay any compensation back...That is why the case is going to be reported to different Dutch authorities and the preliminary report has been signed by 6 visitors. If you are a rodent fan then you definately need to stay here. WE arrived to find the room incredibly cramped with three sets of bunk beds pushed close together. The room was smaller than a pool table. On the second night of our stay we heard rustling coming from the corner of the room. We discovered a mouse upon futher investigation. After we looked around to check our stuff another mouse ran out of the bags. this place is a rundown dump that should be shut down. I don't think that im being petty when i ask to change rooms because of a mouse. i think it's my right to move rooms and not be split up when there is mice around. absolute disgrace! What a disappointment! Reception is in a bar dominated by a pool table, stairs are near vertical and grubby, room is just bigger than the bed. This is student accommodation and if you get student prices, it is OK. We took one look and departed after agreeing a refund for our 3 day visit. Despite pushing from booking.com they subsequently denied this and kept the money. We found an excellent 3 star hotel in the same street at the same price. The bathroom alone was bigger than our bedroom in the Mevlana. We chose this based on the Michelin Guide. They should stick to tyres & food if this is their standard. This place is a fire hazard and unsafe. They crowd 3 bunk beds into a room that cannot handle it. The rooms are cramped and not all of them contain lockers or lockers that fit a backpack! The showers smell and there is only one shower and toilet per floor (for approx. 18 persons). The location is handy, but that is about it. You complain about something and it goes unnoticed. For example, we had a guy staying in our dorm who brought a friend home - where there were only supposed to be 6 of us in our dorm, but then there were 7 and the 7th ""stoner"" snored and slept on the floor. There is no control over who is accessing the building as the reception is in another building. You can't open the windows for fresh air as the bunk beds are cramped up against the windows. They do not have a restaurant or kitchen to use. The stairs are also an issue - the whole place smells and gets hotter as you go up the stairs. The floors in each room are also slanted, on an angle. The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything that is going on in each room. They do have free wi-fi - but it is continuously broken and does not work well at all. This place is a rip-off. Stay away. It is close to the best part of Amsterdam. The rooms are small, but the staff is friendly.",,,

Hotel is at a great location and is value for money. There are several restaurants close by with convenience shops and public transport available. On site parking is available for free and the hotel has well serviced rooms with good amenities including cable tv and wifi internet. Good, clean and comfortable motel/hotel if on a budget and would prefer to spend your money of site seeing rather than expensive accommodations while in LA. Was looking for a good affordable place to stay during our trip in LA. About 20 minutes drive to the town area. The neighbourhood is rather quiet at night, not really safe to walk around but we drove, so not that bad. The staff were OK. The room was clean, fully air-conditioned. Most importantly, the toilets are clean. Everything in the room was fine. Initially, the impression I had for Inns were rather run down, but America's Value Inn at North Alvarado Street turns out to be a different perspective. Walked down the street along the main road about 5 minutes, you can find lots of Mexican food, Subway, Starbucks. Most importantly, for a place like this, the prices are really affordable if you are on a budget trip to LA. We recently stayed at this hotel to avoid the drive home (approx 40 miles away) after a concert and night on the town. The hotel staff was very accomodating and welcoming and the room was actually better than expected. We were able to walk to the Staples center and LA Live and then around downtown as well. If you need a place to stay in downtown and want a clean room that's affordable I would highly recommend this hotel. We felt so comfortable we've decided to stay at this hotel everytime we plan a night out in the city. The story of our stay: 1. We find the place online. $62? Great. And it looks like it's right by Silverlake and the freeway. Perfect. 2. We arrive. Turns out it's not quite in Silverlake. A little closer to Shadesville. Coming inside, we're greeted by the lovely and inviting Plexiglas window to protect the desk clerk. Good for him. Where's ours? 3. We begin to sense a vague creepiness that we just can't pinpoint. I'm not normally picky about hotels. When I'm on vacation I come to the hotel to sleep and shower; all I ask is that it be quiet and clean. And it seemed to be ok. The room looked fine at first - decent size, clean-ish bathroom, functioning internet, normal motel amenities. But something just felt ""off"" here. 4. We notice that there is something alive in the wall. Some kind of insect or rodent noise coming from *inside* the wall between the main room and the bathroom. It didn't sound like a cricket or cicada but it wasn't a pipe or heater noise either. My girlfriend begins to freak out. 5. The brown thing. We find an approx. 1 inch roundish clump of a brown unidentified substance on the floor next to the bed. It looks somewhere between a dessicated poo and a clump of coffee grounds. There is no coffee maker in the room. I can't prove that it was poo, but it sure wasn't pleasant. 6. We decide we're leaving. It's 11:30 the same night we arrived and we abandon ship for a normal motel in actual Silverlake. This is the first time in my life I've ever done this. As if to confirm we made the right choice, we notice a sign in the stairwell stating that ""products used or sold on these premises contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer."" I don't know if this is a common thing, but it was the first time I'd noticed that sign anywhere. 7. On a positive note, the night clerk was very pleasant when we checked out. 8. My girlfriend's cell phone - in her purse - mysteriously called mine as we were driving away. I wonder what Ghost Hunters would turn up at this place. Not recommended.",,,
SpitzieAussie,1460617,"Our stay at the 'Antiche Figure' for two nights was fantastic. The hotel was beautiful and the service was fantastic. We had the deluxe room that has a small balcony and over looks the grand canal, which was great. We actually drove to Venice after initially going to get the train and found that the hotel is within easy walking distance for both. The only possible downside for some people is therefore that you are on the opposite side to the main area around 'San Marco' square. This to us was actually a good thing as it was nice to be away from that whole area at night and around a 30min walk through the streets. You probably see a lot more anyway and may take a lot longer if you are traveling with your wife like me as the shops are never ending. Breakfast was included in our stay at the hotel and was lovely to eat outside as you watched Venice life walk and float by. All amenities mentioned in the brochures for the hotel are there and most importantly work well. Overall, the hotel itself is fantastic and the staff can't do enough for you. You usually don't even have to ask for something as they are always asking you if there is anything you need or if they can help in any way. The hotel has good management and are a credit to them and the hotel. We had a fantastic stay and can't recommend the 'Antiche Figure' enough. Our stay at the Fountain House appears to mirror those of a number of other reviews I have read. We were traveling with two young children (8yrs & 4yrs) and therefore the location being so close to the park and also the tube station was great. The size was good and the bathroom and kitchen quite new. The carpet had a number of burns where someone had dropped an iron while doing their clothes, some curtains & blinds were broken and the couch had a lot of stains. This was not in itself terouble as we understand that you expect some of these things in an apartment used by numerous different people, but we did come back one day to find that the covers on the couch and cushions had been removed and replaced by sheets. I am guessing to have them cleaned, but they were gone for nearly three days and no one said a word to us. A lady did actually come in to check on the broken curtains and noticed that the couch covers were missing and said she would check into it. We never heard back and therefore I can't say the service was very good at all, but the cleaning was done once while we were there for 5 nights and was done very well. As our experience appears to mirror those of others who have placed reviews on 'Trip Advisor', I don't think anything is changing very quickly and therefore cannot recommend this apartment as I have previously done with others.","I stayed with my husband and my daughter in a 2 bedroom standard apartment and my sister and family in one of their 3 bedroom superior apartments. Our standard apartment was nice and very warm and comfortable, nice kitchen, new carpets and new curtains which was a relief because of the review we had read on tripadvisor Kitchen was nice, they have a daily housekeeping service, we loved the location, Hyde Park is just across the street and metro station and bus services outside the door. We thought it was very good value for money, lift was small but we didnât mind, my sisters superior 3 bedroom Apartment had all refurbished very nice furniture and directly looking in to Hyde Park and the Lake. We liked our apartments and had a very good time staying there. We will go back for sure! During our stay in London, we had reserved a 3 bedroom apartment overlooking Hyde parrk. On the downside, the lift was not very big but this was not a major problem as the apartment itself was very nice and comfortable with facilites of a good standard. Our apartment was on the second floor, overlooking Hyde Park with a fantastic view of the Park and the lake. The master bedroom had an en-suite and there was a separate shower rooom as well as a good sized kitchen which was well equipped and clean. The service also included a maid who used to arrive daily to clean up. The apartment was situated in a convenient location as there was access to bus routes and the underground just opposite the building. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in this apartment considering we had read some negative reviews. However, it was a nice apartment and we really enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be staying here again next time we visit. I have recommended it to all my family and friends who are planning to visit London. The appartment was very clean, staff freindly and very close to Hydpark and underground. I would recommed this appatment for family or group of friends either for holiday or for business.I would definitely stay there again. Over priced, stank of smoke, poor level of cleanliness, extremely bad customer service. When we arrived, the staff didn't even get off their chairs to greet us or show us the 2 bedroom apartment we rented. the elevator was broken. Our apartment stank so badly of smoke that my 8 year old cried and didn't ""feel safe"". There was no hair dryer, the sink drain and remote control were broken, there was a body hair on our sheets. When we complained, the head cleaner was defensive (though they did address some of the problems).The following day, the cleaners were confrontational--we just wanted to relax and could have done without the drama. The location is convenient, though loud. Our stay at the Fountain House appears to mirror those of a number of other reviews I have read.

This apartment is not a bad value for the price, relative to other London hotels/apartments. The location is very convenient (literally across the street from Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate tube stop). The kitchen and bath are nicely updated. However, the carpet and the couches were in VERY poor condition. The couches are literally threadbare. Very disappointing considering that we were told this was a refurbished apartment. The service was acceptable, if you keep in mind that this is a service apartment, not a hotel. For example, we had plumbing problems on the weekend that could not be attended to until Monday. The housecleaning staff was very nice and cooperative with our schedule. We are a family of 4, from Mumbai, India and stayed in the pent house apartment at the Fountain House, It was a grand place and V clean, the staff were very good and provided all the services with a smile. If we go back to london, we will stay here only. The room has V good view of the garden and the place has the best location possible, in the main city and yet away from the noise, Enjoyed my stay here, one of the best apartments I have stayed in.",,,
Clare T,531936,"First time in Singapore and what a place to stay. We stayed in Singapore for the Formula 1 weekend and watched the Friday practice from the infinity pool on the 57th floor. Wow, take your breath away, it was awesome. The pool is not crowded, clean and you can have drinks sat on a bed next to the pool, where there are plenty of free sunbeds. The staff were extremely polite and attentive and the food was excellent. The lifts are somewhat confusing, you need your room card to go up and you have to switch lifts at the 22nd floor to go to the 57th floor. We paid the extra to be club guests and we had priority check in and out, entry to the casino (where you can smoke) and a quiet place to sit and unwind. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. Although the hotel was expensive, we probably stayed on the most expensive weekend of the year. There is the mall attached to the hotel which is vast and full of designer labels, you can browse or buy and if you fancy a ride in a gondola, just grab one in the mall. It was one of those once in a lifetime experiences that is unmissable. We will definately stay again. I used the holiday inn express for an overnight stay in Feb 2012 the reception area was very clean and tidy and the staff were welcoming. The bar is a tiny part of the reception area and does not seat many people. My room was on the third floor and was very noisy I did not get much sleep you can hear the water running down the pipes whenever someone else flushes their toilet or uses the shower etc. The fuse kept going in the room so the TV and hairdryer did not work. Breakfast was served from 7.30 - 10.30am so we went down at 9.30am the breakfast room is a tiny room that does not hold many people this was filled so we had to wait and then clear a table ourselves in order to sit down! then we found out that they was not hot breakfast left neither were there any dishes left to use! we ended up eating somewhere else. Most of the cleaners were on their mobile phones whenever your saw them they did quickly try to put them away so we would not notice!! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and most definitely would not stay again!! This boutique style hotel, is in a brilliant location! You can walk to everything and public transport/taxi rank on your doorstep. The room was well appointed, with tasteful furnishing and very comfortable bed. The staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. We travelled on to Sorrento and on our return, they allowed us to leave our luggage at hotel for a few hours while we had a few hours in Rome before catching a late flight home. Highly recommended!","This is one of the best locations in Rome for sightseeing -- the 64/40 busses stop here making it an easy trip to the Vatican and the train station, very close walk to the Pantheon and Piazza Navona. The hotel itself was good -- especially b/c the staff was so nice and friendly. The place has a chintzy look to it though. My room was close to the reception and I needed earplugs at night. It's a good place to stay but ask for a quiet room. This boutique style hotel, is in a brilliant location! You can walk to everything and public transport/taxi rank on your doorstep.

We travelled on to Sorrento and on our return, they allowed us to leave our luggage at hotel for a few hours while we had a few hours in Rome before catching a late flight home. Highly recommended! We stayed here for 4 days in eary June 2011. What a find. Right in the middle of everything so that you can walk to where you want to go. The staff were obliging and went out of their way to get us to where we needed to be for tours etc. Food was great, bed was comfortable room very elegant. Would recommend to others. In the city for a business trip with a little sightseeing, the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. Public Transport (which i didn't need) is right out door, yet the room was really quiet and I slept great. If you arrive by cab have them drop you off on the Corso and walk the maybe 5 meters to the hotel (right in front of the tram stop). The room (number 5) was a decent size with a big bed, sofa (which could be an additional bed) plus a small desk and chair. The shower could easily fit two as well. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was decent (generous by the Italian standard of a cup of coffee). Only downside for a business trip, there is no wlan. The front area has a terminal with free internet available though plus a small section with tour guides in multiple languages. You know what, this hotel really impressed me a lot. I cannot believe that I found such a modern, classy, and elegant hotel like this in Rome. Whether you are with your friends or family, Residenza Hotel will still be the best place to stay in Rome, Italy. Hopefully, when I come back in Rome, I will be able to stay there again. This is the best ever! I really loved my stay in Residenza Argentina. I just cannot think of bad things to say about this hotel because for me, it is just so perfect. During my stay here, the staff accommodated and treated me warmly. My expectations in a hotel was indeed surpassed by Residenza Argentina. Try to stay here some time! I had so many business trips in Rome but I must admit that this is the first time that I've stayed in a hotel like this. I can't help but blame myself because I did not stay here before. I will always consider to stay again in Hotel Residenza on my next business trips. I recommend this hotel! Actually, it's my first time to go to Rome. I think I am just one of the happy tourists who do not just love Rome but also Residenza Hotel. The hotel is just so perfect for me. Even my family loves it. I really can't believe that this kind of modern hotel can be found in Rome. Oh, I almost forgot.. their services are also superb. I just loved my stay there.. Next time I go to Rome, I will stay to this hotel again. Promise! Residenza Hotel is one of the hotels where I stayed during my business trips. It's actually the latest and the best hotel for me so far. I cannot see any flaw in this hotel. Everything is just so perfect. The staff in the hotel really assure that you will have a great and comfortable sleep. The design of the hotel is just so elegant, classy, and modern. I almost forgot that the scenery outside is historical. :) I love to spend my extra time to travel to some places around the world. Since I love exploring different countries, I've stayed to many hotels already. However, I can say that Residenza Argentina is really exceptional. Facilities and equipments are really superb and the hotel staff assure that their customers are safe and feeling comfortable. I've had a great sleep and I enjoyed taking pictures there too. I feel lucky to find such a lovable hotel. 100% recommended! If you are planning to go to Rome, here is a tip for you. Do not look for any other hotels there, just go straight to Residenza Hotel. Service is really superb. Hotel style is awesome. My stay is really memorable and comfortable. I really recommend this! I think Rome is a very great vacation destination. I made a good choice in picking Residenza Argentina! I was kinda surprised when I entered inside because their facilities really look modern. I stayed in a comfy and modern hotel that is located at a very historical place. I treasure all my travel experiences in Rome as well in Residenza Argentina! Stayed here for 4 nights for our first time in Rome. It's not a hotel, more a B & B which is on the 3 floor of an apartment building. Like all the other reviews it's hard to find. We found the airport transfer brilliant. We booked the transfer by email to the hotel - â¬50 was well worth it between the 3 of us, the same price as getting the train in from the airport. Can't imagine trying to struggle around the streets of Rome with luggage. The hotel is in such a central location with bus & tram stops right outside. You can walk to everything. After a day walking around the vatican your feet will be very happy to hop on a bus right back to outside the hotel. To catch the bus for the vatican you go across the road to outside the bookshop on the left. We didn't find the noise at night bad, to be honest if you are sightseeing around Rome, you'll be too tired to hear anything. Found the staff very helpful/friendly. There were 2 staff, one on the day shift and one on the night shift. Breakfast was good, no hot food just cereals, fruits, breads, cheeses, etc and really good coffee. There are lots of places to eat right near by - really like the pizza place nearest the traffic lights on the left. Has more than pizza and has lots of authenic food. This ""residenza"" is actually a luxury design b&b in an large apartment in Rome. It's really difficult to find, although it's on a large square, but when you finally get in it, it's really beautiful and the service is great. Considering that you are in a big european capital (look at the prices in ""real hotels""), it has a very good value. The rooms looks really like a 4-star hotel! We had #3 and had nothing to complain about. The only bad point is that the rooms are a little noisy (you hear the tramway passing and people yelling from the street) but apart from that, everything was perfect! The situation is very good also, within walking distance from piazza navona and the ghetto, where you can eat the famous ""carcioffi"". I warmly recommend this place if you don't mind the little noise and the fact it's a very small, hard to find hotel. I've opened an account just to write a review for this place. A 6 bedroom hotel hidden away in a courtyard in a central location, this did exactly what we needed for a 6 nations rugby weekend. By basics I mean - decent sized room, network cabling for laptops in room, *extremely* clean (rooms returned to spotless every day), great bathrooms, lots of towels, great continental breakfast, brilliant brilliant service at a fantastic price. It's clear that there is real pride in the quality of service here. We will be back in two years time. This is an excellently-placed hotel for exploring Rome - we walked everywhere from here. It's just round the corner from the Pantheon. The rooms are lovely, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The entrance is a little strange (access via a shared courtyard and intercom) and we almost walked past it at first. Breakfast was a little bit limited, and the central location results in a bit of street noise at night, however we would consider staying here again as the location is brilliant and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Nice hotel in great location, walking distance of everything. Great staff, clean modern rooms, good value. Entrance won't be what you are used to as you approach via intercom and courtyard but not a problem as on call 24 hours a day and they stress that too. Also they sent us an email prior to arrive explaining where it is which really helped, very easy to find though as next to the theatre. Breakfast a bit basic but nice and a good way to start the day. We stayed five nights at this hotel. The hotel was very clean and there was an elevator (which was great since it was on the 4th floor). There was also a safe in the room and a private bath. The location was excellent and with 2 blocks of the train station. The staff weren't super friendly, but were nice enough. We got what we expected for the price in the dowtown rome. The location cannot be better !! The staff is extremely helpful and there is a ""family"" feeling !! Breakfast can be improved considering the total cost. The rooms are nice although the strong element of that residence is the location and the service of the staff.",,,
ronbonbfhon,1007145,"This place was very typical for a domestic US hotel, with a little latin flavor. The room was very spacious and comfortable, with a coffee maker and a safe. It has a nice hard wired internet access in the room, as well as WIFI, and computers in the lobby. Everywhere in the hotel was nice, and clean, and all the staff was pleasant and/or professional. I did not eat in the restaurant, too expensive. They have a small casino with a few table games (lost a fast 50 on craps, left). They casino will sell you a drink for a decent price. There is a nice little coffee bar in the lobby, a little pricey of course. My only real complaint is the price, $125 for a single room, allegedly holiday rate. They may try to get you to pay for parking, be sure to question that. There is a big pool area, kids will love it. If you want a cheaper room, EL Faro is right next door, with typical motel type rooms for $75. El faro actually has a nice tiki bar with decent food also. (The some ownership at both hotels) This review is for the hotel by the airport. It is directly behind the Marriot. I paid $75 bucks a night, the room was okay, everything rather dated but clean and functional. Coffee maker, basic amenities provided, spacious room and bath. The tiki bar is nice and the food there was pretty good. This hotel is basically two old buildings which used to be officers quarters at an old air force base. A/c worked fine. I will probably stay here again because the option is to pay $125 per night at the Marriot. There are no other places to stay nearby except La Cima, which had poor reviews (I did not visit there). Everything I read in previous reviews is true. I stayed in a single room 2 nights for $53 per night. This was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever had. It is an old building, with some modest upgrades. The WIFI worked good sometimes, other times no. There was a TV but don't think I used it. My room was on street side and was noisy, but the a/c unit muffled the street noise okay when left in the ""low cool"" position. No elevator, very small breakfast provided in the small breakfast room. Nice parking lot in the rear, but I didn't use it, they have security camera on the street in front also. Everyone super nice at the hotel. The town is very cute. Everyone should stay a few days at the Colonial, for a change.","Everything I read in previous reviews is true.

Everyone super nice at the hotel. The town is very cute. Everyone should stay a few days at the Colonial, for a change. We paid $70 for a double room. Nothing particuarly exciting about it, but was the best value for money anywhere near (we were driving from Ponce). Room was clean and had cable tv, also had a fridge. Approx 5-6 car parking spaces round back, so felt safe leaving the car there. This hotel was reccomended to me by a co-worker. I was only staying for one night and i am not a very demanding person and for the price I paid which was about 70$ plus taxes, I did not expect much. I arrived during the night and the front desk clerk was really nice, his name started with an A, I am soo bad with names!. But only one problem, I had booked two rooms (i went with my boyfriend and my sister with her husband) and neither of them had hot water. I was a little bit mad since that is the least you should expect from a hotel, it sucks showering with cold water during the night! I went to the front desk and told him about our problem and he said that we should not worry, that when we arrive from going out the water would be boiling.... To my surprise, when I decided to take a shower the next day during the morning, we still did not have any hot water. At that moment I was very pissed and at the moment of ckeck out the guy that was in the front desk, which is an elder man with glasses, I explained to him the situation and asked him if there was anything we could do, he just said no and was very rude, and was talking to me as if I was lying, I felt really bad and he groaned like if he was saying ""oh whatever"". Bad experience. Within easy walking distance of the Plaza and the heart of the city, this hotel provided me with a room that was quiet and clean. The hotel service was always available without being intrusive, including maid service to keep the room fresh and clean while I was out during the day and a watchful desk manager to see me in the front door in the evening for an added sense of security. There is also a gated parking facility for visitors. Even with all this, the hotel maintains its historic feel and gave me a real sense of being able to stay at a unique place. If you're traveling on a budget in Puerto Rico, this is a good choice. Large, clean rooms. One block from the lovely main square in Mayaguez. This hotel used to be a convent for the nearby church. The biggest disadvantage we found was that the rooms (we stayed in 2 different rooms) did not have windows, so there was no opportunity to get natural light into the room. The hotel offers free continental breakfast, but it just consists of cereal, toast, small muffins and juice/coffee/milk. Instead, take a 2-block walk to find the Ricomini bakery which is recommended in some travel books. Stayed 3 nights here while in Mayaguez to see the Caribbean Series baseball games. Hotel is adequate and inexpensive. Rooms are very clean, with a small television (high on the wall). Beds are on the ""very firm"" side, and because the hotel was full, showers during peak morning hours only reached ""lukewarm"". We had to ask for a hand towel and washcloth. Maids were extremely friendly; we didn't encounter the rude woman that an earlier reviewer noted. There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage up stairs, or request a ground floor room. We were in room 21, and oddly, there are shuttered windows in the room that open to the lobby. So several mornings we were awakened to people conversing in the lobby. Ask for a room that doesn't have that. Not the place to stay if you're used to resorts or high-end accommodations, but if you like ""unique"", you're comfortable in hostels, B & Bs, etc. , and you like to support local busineses, then you'll be happy here. There is secured parking out back and the front desk folks spoke English and were helpful. Within walking distance are a nice plaza with historical buildings and many unique restaurants. The Hotel Colonial is an inexpensive hotel, for the price ranges between 55 and 75. Now, the front desk service is divided by those who are polite and efficient and those who are not. That is, The morning front desk person (a middle age man) was very polite and helpful, but when his shift is over--everyone else lacks the qualities the morning person, except one young man with eye glasses--who was very nice and even offered me a refund for leaving the hotel before my initial stay. Now, the worse thing that the hotel has is the room service, specifically a middle age lady that constantly knocks your door to disturb your sleep to offer you towels. If you wake up and leave the hotel for the day after 9:00 am she would not clean the room--she did this twice when I stood there, for I expressed grievance the next morning to front-desk. This lady made the whole stay at this hotel my worse experience ever--I mean, one of the day's during my stay--she even handed ""clean"" towels and told me that because the room seem to be clean, she didn't have to clean it, and complimenting me for being neat. beware of this lady This hotel is a block from the town square where events are frequent, but otherwise a bit out of the way and the area is pretty run-down. Room small but clean, and wi-fi good. Parking in a secure but small area behind the hotel. Decent continental breakfast and friendly and helpful desk attendants (with limited English)",,,
ComeAndGoVietnam,596400,"Was in Berlin for ITB so rooms were at a premium. Luckily I found this little gem for under 90 euros per night. Located in the Charlottenburg district just off the Ku-Damm, it's a small family run place located off Mommsenstrasse around a small courtyard. On arrival the owner gave us a choice of 2 rooms and was very helpful in letting us know abut public transport info & the like. The room decor was somewhat old-fashioned but the room was quite spacious, the shower was hot & powerful, & the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast is a cold buffet with bread, ham, sausage, cheese, yogurt, fruit, juices and tea/coffee, and plenty of it. The only drawback to the hotel was the pillows - they are too small and you only get one. The local area is fantastic, with loads of shops, cafes, restaurants & bars. We spent a lot of time in House of 100 Beers, Harp Irish Pub and Klo Bar (a really weird toilet-themed bar). Metro station is around 5-10 mins' walk away. A taxi to Tegel airport takes around 15 mins and costs 15-20 euros depending on the route. And Messe Berlin is 5 mins away on the S-Bahn if you're there for an exhbition. Highly recommended, in short! Attending FITUR at the Feria de Madrid, near the airport, so booked this place as I don't want to travel too far to the show every day. The hotel is located in Barajas which, frankly, is a pretty rough part of Madrid. However, the hotel is only 10 minutes' walk from Barajas metro (not easy to find, but if you stop someone en route they will be able to direct you!), and is also 5 mins' walk from the bus 101 stop which also goes to the airport. Rooms are big with bathroom (bath/shower), TV, minibar and ADSL internet. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Buffet breakfast is worth the cost, continental isn't. Barajas itself is a pretty shabby place but there are some SUPERB restaurants near the hotel notably El Txoko de Anders (upmarket tapas/wine), La Caprichosa (good value Spanish food), and El Principal (rough & ready workers' bar with great set menus). The centre of the city is around 30-40 minutes away by metro, for only 1 euro (has to be the best value metro system in Europe). In short, if you're in Madrid purely for tourism you're better off in the centre of town, but if you need to be near the airport or the exhibition centre, this place is a real gem.","This is a pension in a nice Berlin district, well connected with the city center, via tube or walking. Our room was comfortable, for a very good price. Inernet wifi connection is free. The breakfast is paid separately, but we didn't try it, cause there are a lot of very nice cafeteria very near the pension. No credit card payment, only cash.

Playdays,229613,"This hotel was a real find. Like many hotels in Paris rooms were on the small side but perfectly adequate. The towels were changed every day and all the linen was beautifully clean. The bathroom seemed to have been recently refurbished and was of a very high standard. In my contact with the hotel prior to our arrival Arnaud, who is one of the receptionists, was of enormous help in recommending a decent restaurant for our first night and organising the shuttle to pick us up from CDG. Nothing was too much trouble for him. The hotel was one of the quietest I have ever stayed in both from the point of view of internal and external noise. It is on a busy street but we could hear nothing of the outside bustle. Wonderfully situated close to a large number of cafes and restaurants. We used La Liberte at the end of the street for breakfast and an occasional dinner and a lot of people watching. The Indiana bar at the other end was a good place to have a couple of beers at the end of the day as it is right by the metro exit and has happy hour from 5 - 7!!

Hi, I have stayed in this hotel in Sep 2010 with my partner. I booked it beacuse it was close to metro station (3 min walk). As it was my first time in Paris, I was not sure about the locations and hotel prices. This hotel has good location but the rooms are not upto the mark. The rooms were smelly, carpet was having lots of dust marks, bathroom was not having lock. Well, it is not worth for what they charge for. I would say Euro 20-30 per night is the ideal cost for the hotel like this. I would not reccomend this hotel to any couple but for single travllers, it is worth it. The location of hotel is good, it is near a 3 metro station, u can easy reach all place of interest. near the hotel u can fond a lot of nice restaurants. staff is very helpfully. we have also a breakfast and it was !perrfect! i can only recomend it (croissant are delicious). In the shower was enought place for 2 people. Room was cleaned every day (polishing, vacuuming, clean towels, saops, ...) . This hotel helped us for have a great christmas. Great location near metro stops. Lotes of things to do and see in the area. Lots of great litytle restaurants. Great location, very close to Edgar Quinet metro and easily accessed from airport via RER or direct bus to Montparnesse. Can walk to Seinne through left bank areas.Good restaurants nearby, fabulous street market (mainly food) but sometimes antiques. Hotel very clean and comfortable, excellent bed. Staff very friendly and obliging. 5 Euro continental breakfast good value, includes freshly squeezed juice. Full buffet brakfast also available. Go for it... a great little hotel I would like to have tea and coffee makig facities in the room ad the bar, drink area was not in keeping with the hotel, we were made very welcome and all the reception staff, as well as the breakfast staff were excelent, Thank You. This was the first time I'd stayed in Paris and I was a bit shocked when I saw the size of the standard room. I now realise that this is what it's like in Paris. However, on my own it was okay. Having two double windows that could be opened made the room more airy and they were soundproofed so noise wasn't too much of an issue. I had friends though who stayed in a room over the street and they said it was noisy. The room had everything I needed and it was clean and recently refurbished. The staff were very pleasant and spoke English and there were many, many eating places of various nationalities nearby and as well as a great little supermarket (Monoprix). Two metro stops nearby as well. When my husband joined me after a couple of days we upgraded to a room with a little extra space. All the staff at the desk can speak english and they were very friendly and helpful. It's a convenient spot for cafes and metro service. It was my first visit to Paris and pleasant experiance. Great location, loads of restaurants near by. Busy street but not noisy at night. Metro access great too. We all loved the beds - slept really well. Pleasant hotel, the elevator is larger than others hotels, there are many restaurantes around, metro is so close. Convenient to metro and Gare Montparnasse (for trains heading West and South-West). Cosy room, but big enough; well appointed (decent sized TV, free wireless internet, phone with Skype-type rates). Lots of bars, restaurants and shops in walking distance. Friendly, helpful staff. The air conditioning was wonderful and the room quality and cleanliness are excellent. The only negative was that the rooms are relatively noisy as they have thin walls and thin doors. Also, the free internet connection is a little unpredictable and slow. This hotel has recently been completely rennovated and each room with a theme based on a famours painter. Most of the rooms are quiet, the air conditioning works well. All rooms are I believe relatively small but very tastefully decorated and impeccably clean. I have never stayed in a better hotel in Paris for the money! We had decent stay at the Hotel Elysee Montparnasse. It is close to several underground stations and there are plenty of bars and restaurants near the hotel. The rooms were good value for money although the walls seemed pretty thin. Although the hotel is good value for money (especially for Paris) the area around the hotel is a bit dodgy and the breakfast is average at best. We might return in the future for a short trip. The room was great, very clean and lovely dÃ©cor (looked exactly how it was shown on the website). Breakfast is worth the 9 Euros (great variety and abundance). The area is fine, a few things to visit around the hotel but it's easy to just take a metro to the centre of Paris. room was little small but cleaned. nice location. staffs were very kind. we will stay again when i go in paris. I don't think this hotel ranks 3 stars or the price. Everything was dated and a little funky, room was tiny even by European standards. We stayed there based on TA ratings and because we needed hotel near the Gare Montparnasse (it is in easy walking distance), but would much prefer to be in the Latin quarter, St. Germain, or the Marais. The worst thing -- the very modern glass shower had no flashing or seal at the bottom - so every shower literally flooded the whole bathroom. The best thing -- market day on Saturday morning just down the street. Also -- the staff was very nice, helpful, and friendly. the location is excellent, less than 5 minutes' walk to the metro station (Edgar Quinet line 6) and 10 mins to Gare Montparnass, quite a few restaurants and bars near the hotel, the surrounding area is safe. Room size is small but well equipped, breadfast is good. the rooms were clean and new and the staff was helpful and understanding . the only thing i can find falt with is the scary clown painting in the elevator. it was near a lot of great resturants stayed for 1 night, location is nice if you do not mind some nightlife in the neighbourhood, nice restaurants nearby. Got a room to the back, which was nice and quiet. Each room decorated after a different painter - creates nice athmosphere. Breakfast in the basement, but much better than other Paris hotels. Free WiFi Overall very positive. Location was good for metro, hotel is a nice 3 star hotel, spotlessly clean with helpful staff. Rooms are small enough but for a short stay this is not really a problem. The hotel does not really have a bar as such and we did not eat in the hotel but there are plenty of cafe's and restaurants nearby! If on a budget this is a good hotel. The hotel is in a perfect neighborhood, full of cafes and restaurants, full of life, but very quiet inside the room. It is also located in just 3min. walk from nearest metro station. Room was VERY clean and had great decoration, but was small. Staff was very friendly. Overall a great good value hotel. A small room (the norm in Paris), but well decorated with ensuite and balcony. Very clean. Very good value for money. Wonderful staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return. Gail Muschamp",,,

HelenGomez,308397,"booked through an agent, this hotel was perfect for what we needed. Great location ( red light district is hardly noticed), only 10 mins from MRT statiion. Room was cozy but clean and had everything you needed including BBC News and a film channel! I would use again for 1-2 night stays in Singapore! Allowed us to store bags which was really useful and also reception staff helped answer questions. Free Wifi a big plus! Yes this is an older property and so maybe is a little tired around the edges but some of the reviews do not do it justice. OK the rooms are on the small size but you are slap bang in the middle of the CBD district of Sydney and so space is at a premium and I think for the price the rooms were reasonable. The bed was comfortable and the linen clean, the bathroom was kept immaculate (some of the towels were a bit thread bare but that happens in any hotel) and functional. Desk was useful as we had to work as well - could do with some shelves for clothes rather than the wardrobe. The room was pretty quiet (we were on floor 8) - didn't hear the lift or the street/traffic outside which I was greatly and pleasantly surprised by. Occasionally heard the other room next to us but only the door closing and I think I was on a smoking floor but that is our fault for not requesting a non-smoking floor. Location is great - 2 minute walk to Monorail, 5 mins to Town Square station so you are perfectly placed to see all the sights and get around. Con- The internet was pretty expensive for a day AUD18. We didn't have breakfast there as there are plenty of food places close by that offer better value. Staff were helpful and friendly. We didn't really need to use them so don't have any other comments. We work in hospitality and I think this is a well run hotel. I would stay here again when staying in Sydney. This hotel was perfect for what we wanted. Great location only ten minute walk from Orchard Road, Huge Rooms and Free Wired Internet. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and able to answer many questions that we had. The room was huge and extremely clean and well looked after. We had two double beds in our room which was great. The shower was a rain shower and very good and the bathroom was kept very clean. Free internet in a hotel is quite rare in singapore and this was a good point. We will definitely would recommend and stay here again.","The room is very spacious, with very good bathrooms, warm water, clean restrooms, free drinking water, large nice soft beds, big TV and accommodating staff =) Spacious! Close to orchard rd. bus still have to take taxi, or you can walk I guess. Amenities are the bare minimum, but hey if you're going to go shopping all day, all we need is a comfy clean bed, clean shower, hot water, and blockout blinds so we can sleep in until 9. Highly recommend this hotel! great bargain near Orchard rd. Stayed here for 10 nights over christmas for a family gathering and found the hotel more than adequate for our needs. Rooms large and clean with rainshower and usual amenities.Approx a 15 min easy walk to the beginning of Orchard Ave. Small shop on site had drinks and snacks and other essentials for purchase (very cheap). An asian style buffet breakfast was available for purchase which we didn't need to utilise so cannot comment on it. Reception staff were slow in communicating problem of phone which was never fixed, as we had 2 rooms on different floors made for constant lift usage. Free wifi was a bonus for contacting friends and other family over the festive season. Especially for the location and price would recommend hotel. This hotel was perfect for what we wanted.

Free internet in a hotel is quite rare in singapore and this was a good point. We will definitely would recommend and stay here again. Not far from Orchard road, just a few minutes walk. The rooms are really big and the balconies are also nice. Breakfast is very poor. There's a small kiosk where you can buy some other things to eat. Not an excellent place but it's ok if you're looking for something comfortable and cosy. This plave is far from the maddening crowd that fills Orchard Road and yet only a 10 min(really) only 10 mins walk from Orchard Towers. Rooms were big and comfortable for a family of 4. No food in the hotel but since it is 10 mins away from Orchard Road it was not a problem at all. Staff were friendly & helpful. Taxis readily available. When i first entered the hotel i thought the rooms will not be much good like that of a star hotels... But when i checked in i found the room is much spacious than the hotel where i previously stayed... And more over i had a Balcony and location is also prime near to Orchard road... The TV channels are not available as expected. And we have not had food here so no idea how the food is... I have to agree with Shuggy66 give it a miss we stay there just recently for 2 nights, November 2011 .I felt this hotel did not feel like a hotel, it was depressing the minute you went in, my heart just sank through the floor.Its a learning centre and when you check in you go thur these other doors which takes you to the foyer of the learning centre weird for a hotel its co-shared with them...When the lift opened on 11th floor the smell was awful like a smoking room but as you come out of the lift it says no smoking, our clothes were disgusting after two we we got home everything stank of smoke even the suitcase itself... The restaurant food looks like a school canteen not a restaurant. Don't be fooled by the web site and its pictures. I really dont know why aiswarya nitinkhedkar are talking about giving it 5 and 4 stars other than they must work there or be students would are staying there...Also its not just $200 a nite there are a few extra fees gst ansd another extra $44.00 a night on top of your Try somewhere else.. It was a pleasant stay and good experience with RELC international Hotel, Singapore. Support staff and cleanliness is very good. Also its value for money hotel. We were there for 4 nights and had a good time. Hotel has very good view and surrounding. Hotel staff will assist you for anything which you required starting from tour booking etc. I'm amazed that there are any good reviews here. I know it is at the low price end but shopping arround you can do much better. I only spent half an hour here, put bags in the room, went out and found another hotel, returned and checked out. I felt this hotel did not feel like a hotel, it was depressing the minute you went in, my heart just sank through the floor. When the lift opened on 17th floor the smell was awful like a pet hamster cage in need of cleaning out. The room had adjoining room doors which I never feel comfortable with. No room service either. As I checked out imediately I cannot comment further but those who mention the poor restaurant food don't mention that it looks like a school canteen not a restaurant. Don't be fooled by the web site and its pictures. This was an ok hotel. Room spacious and service was alright. Provided us our extra added bed quite quickly. However, room aircondition was inadequate, sometimes cooled up but most times did not. Considering the heat in Singapore, AC condition was a real dampener. All in all a pleasant stay at the RELC. The place functions as a language college but this didn't really affect my stay. As the other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms really are massive - which is a plus if this is what you are into. I was in an east facing room, with a balcony, which enabled me to watch the red singapore sunrises whilst sipping the complementary tea. Bed was comfy, clean, nothing super fancy, just nice. Facilities: Free wifi. The gym has a treadmill, weights, a stepper and a weights machine (level 8). There is a cafe on level 1 and also a restaurant on level 2. Some of the information in the room booklet is out of date - gym location for example. So be sure to check with the front desk to be sure. Neighbourhood: Not much immediately around the hotel. It is about a 10 minute walk into orchard road (but not central orchard rd), so you can catch a bus from there or keep walking to hit the Tangs/ION shopping centre junction (where scotts rd intersects with orchard). The hotel room clean and huge, frontliners superb...excellence...especially mr adam and khrisnan...unfortunately no room service available for 24 hrs.....everything elses two thumbs up... Very nice reception during daytime. The best receptionist we've ever met. He helped many people to look around Singapore as Singaporean do. Room is big and clean. I don't want to talk about a receptionist at night-time:( Next to the hotel had noisy construction during daytime. Helpful manager. Simple & tidy Newly renovated Unexpected large room (big enough for family w/ kids) Resonable price even during big event Formula 1 Location is fine & quiet, about 20mins to MRT, 12-15mins to Orchard Rd (the walk is quite enjoyable) would like to stay again if go to Singapore",,,
Anubis61,259983,"Nobody stays here by his own money i guess. if you are given one room for free by A.airline company - i guess this is the only channel of finding customers- due to some cancelled flight etc, try avoiding this hotel. one star can be given for clean towels and bed linens, however everything else is bad. small rooms, awful walls, not working air condition, sometimes available hot water, sometimes working lift, 3 channel tv with empty battery-remote control, disgusting food. Staff is not professional but i respect them. they have good will but low competence. Ä° have stayed for one night. Hotel is perfect in all aspects. room sizes. build quality, rooms facilities, staff, location. Nothing to say. if you can find an opportunity at a good price, this should be the first preference. Especially bathroom gets special points. May be one comment for the hotel management, breakfast for such a special hotel is a bit lean. richer options would be expected. also start of the breakfast as 07:00 is a bit late for early flight leaving guests.","Nobody stays here by his own money i guess. if you are given one room for free by A.airline company - i guess this is the only channel of finding customers- due to some cancelled flight etc, try avoiding this hotel. one star can be given for clean towels and bed linens, however everything else is bad. small rooms, awful walls, not working air condition, sometimes available hot water, sometimes working lift, 3 channel tv with empty battery-remote control, disgusting food. Staff is not professional but i respect them. they have good will but low competence. Alitalia put us here when flight delayed Worst hotel ever--carpet so dirty put bedspreads on floor so we did not have to walk on it This so called palace hotel is an horrible buiding 15 minutes far from the airport. Rooms are outdated, carpets ar dirty, lights are ugly. Service is not so bad but really this is not at all an hotel where to stay. it is neither a palace , nor near the airport and certainly not a four stars as it says. Also, the shuttle which is supposed to live the airport every 30 minutes only runs every hour in the evening. We referred to this hotel as the: ""Alitalia Airlines Hotel for Stranded American Passengers"". Alitalia Airlines screwed-up our flight home and had the 'decency'(?) to put us up in this joke of a hotel. Our shuttle was late and by the time we got to the hotel we were offered ""lunch"" which consisted of whatever was leftover on the 'buffet' table. On top of which, was cold. In fact, dinner was cold as well. The food is nothing more than 'conference' food. I lost my appetite. The room was worn and dirty. The carpeting is stained throughout the hotel. Good luck finding an alternate location for food as there are none nearby. I regretted staying here even if it was free. I could not wait to leave. I would never stay there by choice. The only people staying in this hotel with us were fellow Alitalia Airlines stranded passengers. I guess the hotel doesn't need to bother to remedy anything as long as the airlines keep sending them their stranded passengers. The rudest staff in Italy. They barked at me when I asked for assistance. Tried to gauge their guest during the Volcano Crisis. Throwing out families at midnight, to try to get an extra buck. I was a paying customer and got yelled at and things thrown at me. In a bad part of town, close to the airport, the food and restaurant staff were awful. If you know what is good for you stay far away from this hotel. Stranded in Rome due the ash cloud from Iceland. After a day hanging on the airport KLM offered us this hotel. Buses full with stranded passengers arrived, but only one person behind the desk. The next morning with the checking out, the same story. There was only one elevator working. In the room the only thing that was of a good quality was the bathroom. The staff was not very friendly or hospitable. This is a hotel where you do not go voluntarily. I have seen better rooms in a rancid crackhouse. Our flight was screwed bu Alitalia and this was there idea of accomodating my family. mid summer, no a/c, rancid food, dirty beds. I made everyone sleep in their clothes , showers were nasty and staff was worse. If it wasnt midnight when we arrived I would have paid to stay somewhere else. So if this is where u intend on staying wear a garbage bag on your body, and cover your head. For breakfast eat toothpaste and you will be safer. Enjoy!",,,
DorsetDaisy36,571965,"I stayed here in mid November with five other ladies. I have been to Venice many times before,I had initally booked for four of us but two others joined us and to get a rely from Mateo for another room was impossible! I resorted to snail mail with a stamp and that awoke him! When we arrived we found that two of us had to share a double bed! The beds were all very uncomfortable, but we managed. Towels were an issue, the toga type that blot you dry and if you wanted to have a clean one you had to pay! The breakfast was simple, good coffee but you cannot expect wonders for the price we paid. Venice is getting very very expensive so you have to take that into account. The great moment for me was when we were given a front door key to our own front door in the most beautiful city in the world! The position of this B&B is super just two minutes from Ca'Rezzonico wonderful! Please go and enjoy this B&B Mateo is very welcoming but remember this is a B&B do not expect five star treatment. I will certainly return I travelled to Amsterdam with three friends, we stayed at the Fita for four nights. We are all artists so the location of hotel was perfect. We enjoyed every moment at the Fita, we were treated like royalty! Pancakes for breakfast as well as strawberrys, cheese, warm rolls, scrambled eggs and bacon, pastries, the coffee was perfect. Coffee maker in the rooms as well as kettle and tea! Ice machine and ice buckets provided in the rooms so the G&T in the evening was a must! Bed and bedding comfortable, nice and warm, lots of hot water for a shower or bath, we will return!","I stayed here in mid November with five other ladies.

I will certainly return I was looking for a convenient place at a reasonable rate. At Ã¢âÂ¬80/night for a double at the end of November it was perfect. Good room, large modern bathroom, standard breakfast, in a quiet location. It is close to Academia or Zattere for waterbuses. Compared with other B&Bs we stayed at in Italy, this place was poor. Bed was very hard and uncomfortable - hips sore for several days. Breakfast was very poor - warmed up small commercial coissant and stale pre-packaged buns. Attendant stood and watched us eat! Towels were only ""linen"" and were not changed even after three days. You had to pay if you wanted clean ""towels"". Had to close window shutters due to mosquitoes and run AC, which was really only a fan. Caretaker removed air conditioning controls - had to demand to get back. Location on quiet canal was good. Owner is rarely present. Owner is simply trying to milk the place and operate on the cheap. We would NOT recommend this B&B to anyone. Mary & Rich Wright, Arnprior, On, Canada A group of 7 of us stayed at this lovely B&B after having it recommended by a colleague. Had no problems booking by email - Matteo replied promptly every time and was very accommodating when our numbers changed. He was also so helpful when the luggage of one of our party hadn't arrived - let us use his email and suggested places to buy clothing. He also made fabulous recommendations for dinner close by. We couldn't fault the accommodation or the beds! - we had 3 rooms between us - some rooms were a bit nicer and a bit bigger than others (didn't for one moment expect a view at this price) - the bathrooms were all nice and fairly recently renovated. Dorsoduro area is brilliant...SO much less touristy than being right near St Mark's Square or Rialto - and the Zattere area (nearby) is so much nicer than Riva degli Schiavoni We started here on a month long trip of Italy. There are pros and cons of this place: Pros: Great location (possibly the best), Good price, Very clean, very helpful owner Cons: The bed was as comfortable as the floor!, very small rooms with no views I would basically not come back due to the poor beds. They were so hard your arm would go numb if u slept on your side. However, the location is the BEST. My wife and I stayed here during our honeymoon some years ago. Though a bit spartan, the location and price seemed good, so when we decided to return for Carnevale we booked them again. From the outset there were some difficulties-- you can only make the reservation by phone, so this required an expensive call to Italy, and after I made the reservation I was warned that I would have to pay the bill (over 1000 Euros-- it was a long stay) in cash. I am not comfortable carrying 1000 Euros in cash, but I was willing to do it. I did notice that a more recent review said that Ca'Turelli did not honor his reservation, but I thought that since I had stayed here before it would be fine. Nevertheless, I was uneasy. The owner asked me to let him know what time of day I would be arriving a few days beforehand, since he is not there all the time. So, four days before my arrival I send him my flight information. At that point he writes back to say he has lost my reservation due to his computer failing at the end of 2009 and there is no longer availability for my dates. He does offer to put me up in an apartment, in a different section of the city, without breakfast, without photos of where I would be staying, for the same price. I looked to see what else was available and found, to my surprise, that four days before arriving in Venice for a major festival I could get a room at a four star hotel for a much cheaper price. That is what I did. Sure, things happen. But why didn't he have a backup of his reservations, presumably some of his most crucial business information? And of the small number of reviews of Ca'turelli I am now the _second_ person not to have his reservation honored. It seems like a pattern. I think I got lucky the first time I stayed here and unlucky the second time. If you make a reservation here you may have a good experience, but it's a gamble.",,,
GoesAroundTheWorld,234927,"The room that we had was big enough. It looked as a small apartment. There were a small functional kitchen with all necessary dishes. Near the hotel was a small supermarket with fresh seafood. The furniture looked quite old, but it creates a good atmosphere of early 90th. The room has a nice view from window. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was always tasty and fresh. I'd never eaten as much as we ate there ;) It was so delicious. The staff was really friendly. The hotel is located quite far from the center and the sea. It needs to go there by subway or bus. I can recommend this hotel for people who would have a car there or who doesn't mind to walk about 20 minutes to the center, otherwise it's better to find the hotel near the center. The hotel is located in Spandau area. It's near the subway (so it was good for us to get there). The hotel could be easy found by the foreign people. The room that we had was small but good and clean. It had not separated bathroom, but the shower was in the room. I like the breakfast that we had there. There were plenty of eat and everything was tasty. However the hotel doesn't have moder design, but nevertheless it has good look. It is a good deal for its money. So if I need to stay in Berlin in Spandau, perhaps I would choose this hotel again. The room that we had was quite big. It looked as a small apartment. It has small but functional kitchen with all necessary dishes. Near the hotel was a small supermarket with fresh seafood. That could be easily cooked in that kitchen. The furniture wasn't new. But the room has a nice view from window. The breakfast was always tasty and fresh. The staff was always friendly. The hotel is located quite far from the center and the sea. It needs to go there by subway or bus We booked this hotel by a special offer. And for this money the hotel was perfect. It's located in the center. All transport methods is near here. The breakfast was excellent! There were plenty of food and everything was tasty. The view from the window on the Alexandr Plaz is amazing . About the room. The room was not so perfect as the rest. It has out-dated furniture. But it was clean. It has a place for cooking, but there weren't any dishes to cook anything (it was available by additional money). Perhaps It has more modern room, but I didn't see it. This hotel is intended for people who are interested in the hotel location rather than in room.","We chose Hotel Benn as it has a good compromise in communication to both: Berlin SchÃ¶nefeld airport and our daily target: Messe (SÃ¼d). Altstadt Spandau (nearly the only part of Berlin with ""atmosphere"") has 2 stations. One is called Altstadt (the U-Bahn station is 3 minutes walk from Hotel Benn) -and the station of Spandau (U-Bahn, S-Bahn and the railway stops here), which is 5-6 minutes walk from the hotel. There is not much difference (in time) to come from the airport between the different railways: more or less 1 hour. The hotel is nicely maintained: clean rooms and helpful personnel. the breakfests are really great. The prices (like everywhere in Berlin) are overpriced - particularly during any important Fair. The hotel has 2 blocks: one is a charming wing (looks to be a mediavel builiding from the outside) -the other just the opposite: an appartment building from the forties (or so). We had expereiences with the second one: like most so called hotels in Berlin: the flats are converted to small individual rooms and sold as hotel. (Not quite a real hotel, though). I had the chance to stay on the 3rd floor - a real climb (particularly with luggages) through the narrow and squaky staircase... First time I stayed in a room, where the shower-cabin was inside the room. (The WC was separate). But once you get use to it - it can be OK. I have not seen the other rooms of the hotel, they could have been different. All in one: ** and a half. I stayed in hotel Benn for 3 nights with my daughter. De room was clean and the personal was very friendly. Public transport is realy nearby and welcome tickets are for sale in the hotel.The manager was very helpful for us, he did help us with finding the best route to our destanations in the city! My first room was on the top floor - no elevator... my luggage was brought down to a room on lower floor the next day! - The hosts are very helpful! I loved the breakfast buffet! - The hotel is in two different buildings, you'll have to cross the cobblestone street to go for breakfast if you're in the ""pale green"" building - I guess if you're so inclined you could jog for a few minutes before breakfast? - All in all I felt very comfortable, and I loved exploring Alt-Spandau. Even got to watch a wedding in the church nearby, on a perfect spring day! And an outdoor concert on the Marktplatz! - I'll go back to Hotel Benn anytime, and next time I'll bring my husband to show him around! This hotel is one of the friendliest hotels we have ever been in. Only having one day to explore Berlin we were hard pressed to see the top sights. The manager put together a cost effective wonderful plan using the local bus system that was fabuous. My sis and her husband had a very early before breakfast departure the following morning, 5:30am, and the manager had breakfast and coffee all prepared for them. This kind of service is rarely found. We would stay here ANYTIME and recommend this hotel to one and all! The hotel is located in Spandau area. It's near the subway (so it was good for us to get there).

It is a good deal for its money. So if I need to stay in Berlin in Spandau, perhaps I would choose this hotel again. We've stayed here only one night. It was on 1 January :) The hotel is far from the Berlin centre: it's situated Berlin's Spandau district. But it is very accessible via public transport: for example, altstadt spandau u-bahn is only a 5-minute walk away. I can't say that room was perfect, because it was just 3 star hotel. For one night - it was enough. There wasn't separately bathroom, the shower was in the room. The breakfast was good, but nothing special. In conclusion: it's usual 3 star hotel. But I am sure that I would not stay here again.",,,
Vasios,593823,"Stayed there as part fo a group of 15 people so I can't really comment on the value for money as I don't know what is their usual walk-in price. The hotel is a typicall 4 star average hotel. Nothing impressive, nothing really dissapointing. First room we were offered wasn't cleaned well and we asked for a change which was done in 5 minutes with no hassle. The hotel offers free sauna/turkish bath, I can't really comment on the quality of the facilities since I haven't been to many more but they seemed nice to me. Location is not great but there is a tram station just 30 meters from the hotel which can take you to Sultanahment (Blue Mosque, Agia Sofia etc) in 20 minutes. Our roum was very hot for no apparent reason (heat was off) so we had trouble to sleep. In my opinion you should choose this hotel only related to price, If you are offered a price less than 90Ã¢âÂ¬, it's a good deal. Stayed there in Nov 2011, we were welcomed very warmly by the reception staff who answered all our questions about location and local transportation very warmly. The rooms are obviously recently renovated and have a feeling of modern design. Yes, you should try to get a room in 8 or 9 floor as the view obvioulsy worths it. There is also a parking garage underground the hotel which is a separate bussiness and it costs 21â¬ per 24h. Pricey, but I guess this is paris. Only downside was the average and limited breakfast in my opinion. In any case i would say that the hotel is a safe choice in the area, and I would definately book it again if I revisit paris and want to stay in the same area.

They provide wonderful food, specially service. Waiters are perfect. They do their bests to make you comfortable! In Turkey people know how to serve!! I would highly recommend to stay at this wonderful Hotel! After a long time I came to Turkey, Istanbul. I stayed at Interistanbbul hotel for whole my trip duration. it was very nice and descent hotel. The receptionist was very nice and polite :) If I would go to istanbul, i will stay there again. Also, i recommend this hotel for those who are planning to stay in istanbul. i am glad i chose this hotel... Great hotel, close to new, very exciting Panorama 1453 Museum, and the walls of Old Constantinople walls. Highly recommended",,,
Tracy50_10,151699,"Small ,quaint and romantic. Clean King size room with sm table and chairs. The ocean was wonderful to go to sleep by. Great pool area. Kitchen was a plus, the pool on the roof gave you a big break from the heat of the day. Very helpful staff. We arrived in to Culebra picked up our rental car and made our way to the Bahia Marina Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted with a wonderful welcome drink and shown to our rooms. The views were beautiful. The rooms were all that we expected, clean plenty of room, Lg balcony over looking the pool with the swim up bar. We enjoyed eating in the hotel resturant. Food was excellent!!!! And we tried everything on the menu. BUT,The very best thing that we did was to go on the day trip with Captail Bill on his 33ft. sailboat. He took us to wonderful divespots, great beaches, and wonderful photo opps.His meal on the boat was as good as any resturants. We enjoyed it so much we did the trip again on Tuesday. This time he took us to the other side of the island for another wonderful day.

Epidemic,80246,"This was the worst place my wife and I have ever stayed. We were passing through SD for the night and decided to stay here because it was right off the highway. The room was musty and the bed was hard as a rock. I have stayed at Motel 6 in other cities before, but this place does not measure up to their other hotels or other budget hotels. Pay some extra money for somewhere else. This was the worst place my wife and I have ever stayed.

I have stayed at Motel 6 in other cities before, but this place does not measure up to their other hotels or other budget hotels. Pay some extra money for somewhere else. One of the worst Motel 6 I stayed in a long time. Avoid the tower. We got a room near the elevator and there was constant noise throughout the night. You could also see the bright light from the hallway trough the door so that it was never completely dark in the room. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were the thinnest I had ever seen. Also the room had only one bar of soap and no shampoo. Luckily we stayed there only one night and avoided the bedbugs and hookers mentioned in the other reviews. Please do yourself a favor and stay away. Seriously, everyone in here is bashing this Motel 6 when I've been here literally almost every single month for the past 2 years with no incident. I have never, however, gotten the tower, it's always the main building where the office is located. I stay 1-2 nights before having to drop off my boyfriend at the airport (reason why we're there every month). We have never experienced bedbugs, or anything horrible at all. We stay, sleep and feel refreshed the very next day, it definitely is a bummer when they don't have rooms, because we stay there so much that rooms have gone down to about 40 bucks a night. This is recommended for any type of stay, long or short. I actually try to stay at Motel 6 at other places I go. One thing they do not have however, is a hair dryer, so make sure that you bring your own hair dryer. We just spent 8 nights at this motel and it was an excellent choice. I had some fears prior to arriving at the motel regarding noise factor, comfort of the beds, cleanliness, etc., however, I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed on the 4th floor of the ""Tower"", which is a 4 story complex located behind the main building, and it was very quiet, clean, and comfortable. We had an excellent view to the west, and was able to see the nightly fireworks from Sea World. I would recommend this Motel 6 to my friends and advise them to request staying on the 4th floor of the ""Tower."" In addition, we had excellent customer service from the management at this motel regarding our reservation. Without going into detail, they were very accomodating in ensuring our stay was enjoyable, and I thank them for going out of their way in assisting us. With all of the negative comments left on this website, I thought it was appropriate to leave a positive one. Another excellent amenity was the close proximity to I-8 and our ability to get to the beaches and Sea World within minutes. Total thumbs up!",,,
nikolakisx,310792,"Hotel very noisy located on a main avenue and subject to constant car noise all night. Also front desk facilities during the weekend and daily after 6pm, non existent. Avoid if possible. This is definitely a 3 not 4 star hotel. Good accomodation and breaksfast, but hotel is in a very noisy location due to its proximity to tacsim square. Even rooms at the back overlooking bosphorus are noisy at nite.","The hotel is in a very center of Istanbul, just a few meters from Istiklal street and Taksim square. Many shopping opportunities near hotel and opposite are also few cheap restaurants with Turkish specialties. The breakfast was very good. The hotel can be recommended the most remarkable thing is the breakfast, it has lots of variety and the restaurant is very cozy and has a nice view, the rooms are small but clean and comfy, make sure to get a bosphorus view, the location is more than gr8 just a few steps from istiklal street *where the main night life exists and lots of shopping and also few steps from taksim square, staff is polite and helpful. we r planning on our nxt trip to stay there again very good breakfast with nice different varieties ,very good staff , excellent location close to all transportation facilities , room was clean but very small I was very pleased with this hotel. People there were very nice. Excellent indoor pool and Turkish bath. Located at Taksim Square, from where you can go anywhere. I recommend it! I spent a pleasant stay. For all of those writing all kind of comments and for those reading it and thinking - this is a dump, you are completely wrong. Marble hotel is in face exactly what you are paying for. It is neither a dump nor a deluxe resort. Firstly, i've stayed in Marble, Grandstar, Nippon, Grand Oztanik and few other hotels several times during last few years privately and business wise, so i know what i am talking about. Main thing that you have to keep in mind when booking Marble is - location. Probably the best in Istanbul. That is if you are interested in walking through city's artery Istiklal, do a little shopping, try some bars, see people and enjoy some nightlife. If you just want to only see culture & visit city attractions and after that rest in your hotel withour trying some restaurants, bars, nargile or other things Istanbul is famous for, go somewhere else. But keep in mind that there is literaly NOTHING to do after nighfall. Regarding Marble and good side of staying there, location is great with everything in just few steps from hotel (taxi, tobacco, good food, money exchange, bars, shops, restaurants, Istiklal street), view is nice (if you book Bosphorus view), breakfast is little bit ""stronger"" then before so it is fair enough, hotel even has parking free for guests (which is good in this part of the town). Some rooms do look little bit worn out, but for the price you are paying - come on. I've stayed in all kind of rooms there, and generally, hotel is ok. Some rooms facing Siraselviler Cadessi can be noisy due to Turkish need to horn & play loud music in their cars, specially during weekend. So, when booking it, ask for a room on upper floors of the hotel. If you are a normal person that needs a normal, clean room where you will spend few hours sleeping after wondering around the town whole day, then Marble is your choice. If you're looking for some place where you will enjoy your free time, relax in a big hotel lobby or whatever similar, then book some other hotel. I stayed there a week and went to my room only for sleeping. It is an acceptable moderate hotel, but not as a 4 star Hotel as I was told by my travel agency. The rooms were clean & tidy, but the towels and bed sheets were old and sometimes ripped off. AC was horrible. I changed my room after 3 days struggling with the AC. The other AC was a little better. I got to know other people staying at different Hotels, and they all had the same complaint. So that's something common. The reception was helpful and polite. The location is very good, cause you have access to everything: shops, bus station, underground, restaurants, etc. Breakfast was fine. The Hotel is quiet inside, although the surrounding area is very crowded and busy. All in all, it's moderate in everything, but its rate is a bit high for a 3 star Hotel. well, we cannot say that this hotel deserves a 4 stars, but still it is a very nice 3 stars hotels. The room was modest but it was clean, actually you will not need more than that for a trip with friends, but of course i don't recommend at all for honeymooners! However, it is important to mention that all hotels in Istanbul are old and over-rated, so this is the case with all the 4 stars hotels & even the 5 stars hotels. The breakfast was very delicious and there was a big variety of delicious food offered. The staff is friendly but they are not very good in English, but this is the case with most of the Turkish people. The location is great, near everything. Please do not leave any valued belongings like money or expensive jewlery outside the safe box when you go out of the room. This is definitely a 3 not 4 star hotel. Good accomodation and breaksfast, but hotel is in a very noisy location due to its proximity to tacsim square. Even rooms at the back overlooking bosphorus are noisy at nite. Pro's: very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Cad., nice view from the restaurant to the Bosphorus, very good and comprehensive breakfast (turkish + american style), price Con's: Air condition in the room was poor, obviously no AC in the lobby and the restaurant. WLAN in the room was not working, only in the lobby. Noise from the street. Outside the hot season (when AC will not be necessary) I would recommend this hotel to my friends! This hotel was one of my worst life experiences. The service was substandard, the rooms were dirty, creepy and tiny. The walls were paper thin you can hear the guest next door urinating and flushing the toilet!!!! Ofcourse the air conditioner was really bad, leaking water and so noisy I was not able to sleep easily. Also the hotel owner is extremely cheap, neon lamps are used in the reception and the corridors between the rooms are always dark unless there is someone is moving out there. The only teeny tiny advantage of this hellhole is its location near Istiklal street. However the hotel itself is in a small unpleasant street. I strongly do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone and I wonder by which standard it was rated 4 stars!!! The worst hotel I lived in my life, the rooms smelled bad, furniture and carpets invalid and very old Need to be changed, the strange thing is that bathwater rusted I think the pipe is rust, Air conditioner noises wake you during sleep,the heating system does not work, when you complain no one cares,You can not hear the word courtesy or welcome from hotel staff ,as well as the receptionist, who is generally more morose. one of the reception staff Try to sell me mobile SMS at a higher price than usual, when I refused to buy from him , the answer has become I do not know whenever I asked him something. During breakfast you will notice that the ants eat with you at the same table. Had breakfast once at this hotel, although I have lived in it with 7 days,I could not leave this hell because all the hotels that i had been contacted , There are no rooms are available .I have not tried eating any meal at the hotel after what I saw at breakfast. No one helps you to carry the bags, your bag should carry yourself, do not try to ask assistance from staff of the hotel because they will exploit you . The first time in my life heard of a hotel make the heavy maintenance work during the presence of hotel guests, you hear the noise and cracking and heavy drill works, when you complain they say it is in the building next door Write these notes, so that no one in this nightmare, yes, it's a nightmare, it's not 4-star hotel it was not up to one star 1) Rude staffs 2) They do not offer u all the services they must 3) Not a 4star, only a 2 star 4) You can not relax & have a calm sleep in this hotel (Noise from street will disturb you, all the night you will bother by car horns & ambulances sirens) 5) You can find better hotels with better prices in other places in istanbul so dont rush for booking this one",,,
monkeykieran,230551,"My friend with whom I was sharing a room with had stayed at the hotel before so when we checked in this was mentioned, I am not sure if this had any effect on us being upgraded to a junior suite but it was a nice gesture by a very attentuive and friendly man at check in. My friend had said that the standard room was perfectly sufficient and spacious but ours was even nicer, as it was very quiet facing onto the internal countyard, and had it's own kitchen with hobs and microwave (we did not use), cutlery, plates and more. The mini-bar was well stocked and the room had the usual internet, international TV etc which we also did not use. The breakfast was really varied, really good quality and fresh, serving a range of hot and cold items including the usual eggs, meats and fruits/cereals, savoury and sweet and a great range of drinks including to my satisfaction some vitamin drink tablets. The only slight draw back although it didnt bother us too much was that the lovely shower was over a bath that could be seen by a large glass panel from the bedroom, so unless you purposely averted your eyes or lied on the bed you could look at the other person showering. Luckily myself and my friend are quite comfortbale with this, as I would be with my girlfriend, but more reserved or older guests might find this a bit off-putting. Might be a good idea to use frosted glass even. Still a perfect hotel for me, no fuss, perfect location (inbetween kreuzberg and friedrichshain), clean, friendly, and for me incredibly good value. I will definitely stay there again. I have stayed at this hotel three times, as it is in a great location if you like visiting the bars and clubs of Friedrichshain, opposite Warschauerstrasse station. The lobby, bar and reception are like the staff very welcoming to all guests even if you are a bit worse for wear. The lobby is really chilled and relaxed but I always get a sense that it full of ""Trendy"" brits who think they're all a bit cool for school, great if you like that sort of thing, but not really my vibe. The breakfast is fantastic, good range, very fresh, pity theres never freshly squeezed juice just that made from concentrate stuff but not the end of the world. The rooms are very basic, in decor and facilities, the hotel aims for this minimal vibe aside from the random assortments of books and things), but I personally find it a bit too plain and I think the shared rooms have the beds too close to each other on the mezzanine levels and the mattresses could be a lot better all round. From memory it costs only a bit more to get a room by yourself or with two people than it costs for 3 or more so id suggest doing that as there isn't much space in the shared rooms.","Stylish hotel, belonging to the Spanish Melia-group, but without the Melia-standard. plus: + location + clean + new + breakfast (but it costs 19 euro!) minus: - extremely slow reception (10 minutes to check out per person??) - you hear your neighbours through the walls - bed not very comfortable - pillows are just empty bags - no free internet - too warm all combined: reasonable. Have stayed at this hotel twice and now booked a third. its so easy to get to from the airport and really close to the city. The staff are fantastic can't help you enough. The rooms are so modern and if you get one of the central showers you can have a lot of fun with your other half! The bar and breakfast area are lovely, we often had a nighcap in there. Breakfast was lovely too good options and as much as you wanted. Room was cleaned every day, hotel overall is spotless throughout. Courtyard is lovely to sit in for early evening drinks before going out lovely touch like complimentery nibbles from the bar. All in all fantastic hotel, nearby local fast food is also great! Try the aisan lady in who cooks the noodles just by the station entrance. Only one thing, take your own travel kettle no tea or coffee making in the room. Stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend for 4 nights at the start of May as part of the standard special promo on expedia. Let me list the good and the bad. good: - Extremely clean - very modern - Fantastic service (allowed us to check in at midday, was always helpful, funny, good english, and always had a smile) They told us how expensive internet was and that we could use there front desk computer for emails. They also let us print out a 14 page document for free. - Pretty good location - 5min walk to the trains - Good cheap markets nearby. - Very quiet. bad: - Strange square pillow design that I just could not get comfortable on. When asking for a different pillow which was a little harder at the front desk, they had none. - I think it is standard with European hotels but wireless internet was way too expensive - 8 Euros an hour! Lots of free wi-fi cafes in Berlin if you bring your laptop. - Bathroom is awkward - It has an open window to the bedroom, lacking a little privacy. - Room was a little tiny for a 4 star hotel. - no air conditioning and was quiet warm despite it being cool outside. Could control this by having the windows open. - It was advertised a double bed on our booking, unfortunately it was just 2 singles pushed together. It made it very hard for me and my girlfriend to get cozy with the big split down the middle. So all in all, I don't think this is a 4 star hotel. It has some exceptional elements, but others thet dissapoint me regarding the room and its comfort. But I think most people will still enjoy there stay here as it passed my main checklist of Service, Location, affordability, and cleanliness with flying colours. My friend with whom I was sharing a room with had stayed at the hotel before so when we checked in this was mentioned, I am not sure if this had any effect on us being upgraded to a junior suite but it was a nice gesture by a very attentuive and friendly man at check in.

The hotel is very clean, the service is very good and the rooms are lovely. The rooms are big, spacious and well lit. The bathroom is also big and very clean. The beds are comfortable and the heating was excellent. (it was -3 when we were there!) The mini bar isnt too expensive either and is stocked everyday if you use any of its contents. The hotel is just beside the S-Bahn and can easily move in-out of town. Getting the S-Bahn to Alexanderplatz really meant we could see everything without any trouble. The trams come so often anyway that there isn't a need for a taxi. The east side gallery of the Berlin Wall is just around the corner which was a fantastic discovery and clubs such as Watergate/Berghain are also very near. (Must go to both-it was AMAZING!) Overall a great hotel, would stay again and would defo recommend anyone to stay there too! A super modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Our room was bigger than we expected, I thInk we were upgraded. THE BATHROOM SHOWER WAS GREAT - BEAM ME UP SCOTTY!I felt a bit vulnerable walking from the station to the hotel when it was dark but that was the only negative. Absolutely perfect place where to stay if need silence and to stay apart form crowded center. Faultless service and location. Enjoyable style make senses about something kind of outstanding. I do recommend:) Really nice and modern hotel. One of the best I have seen. It is really good location for a Berlin visitor. Very close to a central station. I am not sure how was it price-wise as I had a cheap deal through lastminute.com. Nice hotel, very easy to find from ostbahnhof. Clean and comfotable rooms and very helpful reception. Breakfast if not included is 19 Euros per person and is a bit steep! Ideally you need to use the U-Bahn to get to the centre of Berlin of face a 30 minute plus stroll",,,
Kate O,618789,"Having recently stayed in the Lotus Boutique Hotel I can safetly say that I would not recommend it to anyone. The Hotel is located in a rundown area of the city and while close to the airport is miles away from anywhere else of interest. To say that the breakfast was disappointing would be an understatement; stale bread, terrible coffee and hot chocolate, poor selection of fruit and no yoghurt, however the restaurant food is not bad. The general level of cleanliness was poor. The swimming pool opening hours are bizaare, claiming to open from 7am-12pm and again from 6pm to 9pm, ensuring that optimum sun hours are missed.While staff were generally nice some were unable to carry out the basic task of ordering a taxi and providing information about the general area. If however you feel like a laugh stay for one night to read the in-house hotel information pack which lays claim to an endocrinologist and nutritionist designed menu! Lovely, cozy hotel. Very friendly staff. It is a drive away from all parts of the city, but seemed decently centered as most of Cali cities are spread out. Seemed like everything was a 20 minute drive which worked well for us. The Zoo, the beaches, downtown, it just worked out great for us. Staff was so accommodating and helpful. Great hotel, if you plan on using a rental car. Lovely, cozy hotel. Very friendly staff.

The Zoo, the beaches, downtown, it just worked out great for us. Staff was so accommodating and helpful. Great hotel, if you plan on using a rental car. I stayed in the Las Casitas Village with some friends. Our villa was beautiful, clean and had wonderful views. Unfortunately, the staff, with very few exceptions, was horrible. No one was friendly and the wait staff at all the restaurants and bars we went to seemed annoyed when we ordered from them. The food was average at best and very expensive. Also, review your bill very carefully, because they tried to charge us for breakfast (which they told us several times was included) and they also tried to charge us for round trip transportation to the airport when we only used it one way. The infinity pool was wonderful, but once again, service was bad. The beach was ok, but it took over an hour to get there. For the price, we really expected better service. Lovely, cozy hotel.

Great hotel, if you plan on using a rental car. This little motel was perfect for my needs. I stayed here to attend a conference. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, shower hot and the TV great! It didn't bother me that my room did not have a view as I was only in the room to sleep. I was able to walk at night very close to the hotel to get a brilliant dinner and a late night coffee (which was great tasting, I might add). During the day I was able to go for a pleasant stroll and found an awesome park and brilliant shops! The staff could not be more helpful and warm. There were an abundance of free DVDs and great free wifi. The hotel is old and the walls to the rooms thin so you hear what is going on outside BUT if you sleep well then don't let this deter you from all the positives surrounding this motel. Worst Hotel experience I ever had. It was hard to find, and the hotel employee who we called for directions was unhelpful. We arrived late, and when entering we were greeted by an empty desk in a freezing lobby. After a few minutes, we realized it was the concierge desk. So we carried our stuff up a huge staircase without still seeing an employee. At the top of the stairs, there was a bartender cleaning, we asked for a drink but were told the bar was closed We walked over to the front desk and waited at least 5 minutes without seeing anyone. Finally, a rude guest agent took the time to give us a room. He really seemed as if he'd rather be doing anything else, and had a very phony tone. When we arrived to the room, it was 2 beds instead of one. We were too exhausted to care anymore. The building has a very old feel and the room was just average with no view really. Breakfast was buffet style and average at best, with minimal customer service skills from the wait staff. Dirty tables and empty drinks everywhere. ""Refill please?"" The location is on the wrong side of the city. In an area formerly known as a combat zone of Boston. Famous for hookers and fights, as well as drug dealing, pan handlers, and murder. Paul Pierce was stabbed across the street. If you are planning on seeing a show on Tremont St. and nothing else in Boston, its ok. Or if you have a family member in the Tufts hospital which is across the street, and the ambulances make that all to obvious. Although, my boyfriend had good intentions, I'd rather stay comfortably home instead.","It has everything to show as a good hotel but not as a 4 star hotel. it has a good room service, good food cooking specially fish, good entertainments such as billiard table but if I should go back to Dubai, I will never choose this hotel again. it's Breakfast & lunch were not equal to 4 star hotels quality located on down ton near naser sq. an small 4 star hotel ,but its difficult to say its i really 4 star,because the rooms equated by minimum facility....old type of TV....poor mini bar...the food was so so ,one day good ,another day very simple than picnic. also they forgot my transport to airport at the end of stay. but this hotel have some positive points: 1-kind staff 2-very big room and bath room. 3-really clean 4-very big bed Having recently stayed in the Lotus Boutique Hotel I can safetly say that I would not recommend it to anyone.

When we first entered the room we thought there had been some kind of misunderstanding. We couldn't believe that the money we paid would buy us such a big, spacious and nice room. Bed was also huge. But after double-checking we found that everything was in order. The roof-top pool was what you can imagine. Not the biggest, but since no one else was there during our stay that didn't matter much. The only problem was actually the magnetic key card, which we had to change twice a day. Annoying? Yes. Another quite weird thing was the overcharging for internet (both wireless and wired). Around AED70 per day is actually a third of the price of the room. We were surprised about how big and spread out Dubai is, and soon realized that the part of Deira where this hotel is doesn't really offer much. The climate is hot and walking is not really an option, so be prepared to go where you need with cabs or the brand new Dubai Metro. Breakfeast was not included in our particular booking, but we had it the last day and it was really worth it. Big selection of everything you can imagine in the morning - whether you're from the Middle East or from Europe. We liked this hotel, the biggest room and bed we ever stayed to :),very clean room, amable staff, they even have parking place in front of the hotel, you can easily get to any place in Dubai or Sharjah, the pool is at the top of the building and is little but we were the only ones who used it so it weren t any inconvenient I liked also the breakfast(in one day i wanted something special and they prepared that food) There is an exchange office, shops, at the hotel Internet isn t free",,,
auklazer,631598,"The strangest thing I've seen at a hotel in a long time going into their lobby. I'm a road warrior so hence, I've got my head down (not looking around for anything exciting like ambiance), tugging a piece of luggage with both hands into the front of the hotel. The double front doors automatically open, as they should, when I'm not even paying any attention to them. I enter a brief anti-lobby then another set of doors; or should I say, a single pull door not even wide enough to pull the luggage through. So I've got to drop the luggage, swing the door, and push one piece through at a time into the hotel lobby. I've not seen this poor a piece of engineering since the Yugo. Otherwise, nice staff, beautifully clean suite, nice office chair at the living room table, but they certainly are missing the boat with the extremely over-sized behemoth of an antiquated analog television. Like most bigbox Las Vegas casino hotels, if you like the theme, they are great places to stay and have a ton of fun. But I had a curious experience with their poolside dining (no name on restaurant). I had ordered the turkey -burger sliders. Sounded like a neat idea, low-fat and all that. I started to eat one and thought about how much gristle this meat had. I almost swallowed it, and then stopped. I pulled out a round piece of plastic (the item they use to contain the turkey when pressed). It had gotten cooked right into the burger. It was about 2 inches in diameter and could have caused any number of severe medical issues if swallowed. So, I showed this item to my poolside waitress. She was aghast. She bounded into their poolside restaurant claiming she'd handle this with the GM of the establishment. And low and behold, a potentially near-death food experience at Paris poolside is worth exactly $31 on a $120 poolside experience (hey, I wasn't dining alone). The least they could have done was comped the bill. I would have been happy and you all would have been less warned. One of my favorite ""best-value"" hotels for San Diego. Let's face it, San Diego hotel prices for downtown can be hard on the expense account. But the Hampton Inn, on Pacific Coast Hwy, (walking distance to Little Italy and the Gas Lamp District), always seems to maintain the best price for the location in town. Very safe underground and well lit parking garage, too. Very clean rooms and an airy and open lobby and breakfast spot.

We stayed at this hotel for three weeks while a family member was receiving medical treatment at IU. The room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The staff was wonderful. They were friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to be sure that our needs were met. The building and all of the facilities are extremely well maintained. There is some construction going on immediately around the hotel, so the area is not very scenic. There are partially built buildings with cranes and large dirt mounds, so it may not have a great first impression. However, there is no construction noise. I highly recommend this hotel. Bad hotel management. had concerns and requested to see manager. never did. hotel had bed bugs. shuttle service get upset if they have to go further than 1 mile from hotel.(only go to hospital and downtown) unfriendly staff. Candlewood Suites I picked this hotel for several reasons one being they offered packages to the zoo and Childrenâs museum that saved us a lot of money. They are just about a mile from the zoo. All though the location is a little odd the price was great. The hotel rooms themselves were amazing. We travel with a two year old that goes to bed early so we prefer suites whenever possible. I booked a one bedroom but was upgraded to a two bedroom which was perfect. This was a former apartment building so they are set up with a long hallway with the bedrooms and bathroom off of that. The kitchen was perfect and enabled us to save money by cooking both nights of our stay. My husband appreciated the recliner in the living room. My son loved having his own room in a hotel. The area is mostly hospitals and the IUPUI campus so a lot of students and people staying while their family is in the hospital. We also saw a lot of football fans staying there due to the close proximity to the Colts stadium. It seemed very safe and there was a fence that surrounded the entire property. We did not go down and check out the pool area since it is outdoors and it was way to cold for that. There also was a playground area down there but the weather was not right for that either. The room was very clean as were the hallways and lobby. The little grocery area was well stocked but a little expensive but nice if you needed something quick. They offered free DVDâs to go with the DVD player in the room. Not a big choice but a nice touch. The staff was all very helpful and friendly. The free wifi worked great except for the morning that they had changed the password and I didnât know it. A quick trip to the desk and I was back online. The kitchen provided paper towels, free coffee, and tea bags. Our stay was great and we hope to stay there again in the spring. I will note they were having a lot of issues with one of the elevators but they were working to fix it most of the time we were there. Since there were two that was not an issue for us. My stay was fantastic!! Staff was great nice oversized clean room. Came in town for a convention and wouldnt stay or recommend anywhere else. Wish I would of brought the family and actually used the room. We were unfamiliar with the area and the employees were great at helping us. They also had a shuttle that took us to our event downtown. Had to be in Indy for two nights due to my husband's surgery. Suite was very comfortable and clean. The price was excellent for the amount of space and the location - right across the river from the VAMC. You don't get housekeeping every day, but that was fine with me ~ just didn't know that ahead of time. I felt very safe the second night when I stayed alone. I stayed for a week during my spouse's surgery and initial recovery. Only a mile and a half to IU Med Center's Barnhill entrance. With the Med Center's $5 for valet parking it was quick and economical, I didn't avail myself of their free shuttle. The suite was fabulous. Full kitchen, very room and very quiet for sleeping. Even two TV's with cable and Wifi! The staff was friendly and helpful. There is also a nice little pantry to purchase food items you may need. If you need a place for an extended stay while a loved one is a patient at IU Med Center, this is the place! I just returned from Candlewood Suites City Centre about an hour ago. I had to stop and write this review before unpacking. I spent only one night there, 10-16-10, and wished I could have stayed longer. Both housekeeping and front desk were friendly , professional and helpful. My husband and I were pleased. You hear so many horror stories about hotels with dirty linen , rooms and rude staff. Not here. If all of the Candlewood hotels across the country are this good, then whenever we travel will definitely book at one. .Thanks again to the staff for making our visit comfortable and memorable. We booked our two bedroom suite in February to arrive in July for a race weekend. We arrived early in the afternoon and were told that our room was being cleaned, so come back in an hour. When we got back, we were told we didn't have a room at all!!!! They wanted to send us two miles down the road to a 'sister' property and be given a ONE bedroom with two beds....FOR FOUR PEOPLE!!! Their excuse was that someone had to extend their stay so they kept the room we had reservations for, which is ludicrous...they should have moved those people and not inconvenienced us. When we pushed the issue, they ended up giving us two one bedrooms on site. We observed them doing the same thing to another group right behind us....had reservations, no room. Upon checkout, I asked why they did not have a room for a PREPAID reservation and the clerk just said...""you don't have a room until you get a room"", so I said, ""So a reservation doesn't mean anything here does it?"" She agreed. Great way to do business Candlewood. My wife and I have been staying at this Candlewood Suites, off and on, for the last 2 years. Due to my health situation, this is the best place to stay with its location and price. It is close to the Clarien Health hospitals, IU, Riley and also the VA hospital. They have a special rate for transplant patients. There is weekly housekeeping, a workout room, laundry room, outside pool, and coffee machine all at no cost. They also offer free shuttle service to hospitals and downtown Indy. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The floor plan is more like an apartment. The room is spacious and clean. Do yourself a favor and try them out.",,,
AshNagpur,627800,One of the very good hotels at Hongkong......Great house keeping staff & always pleasant... Rooms are spacious....Far away from busy city.. Charge for internet is very high The worst hotel have come across. Very arrogant and worst staff at night shift during my stay... Very very small rooms... worst room services... the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life... Air Conditioner temp is controlled from the reception itself.. Worst room services.....,"We stayed in the hotel in May 2012. I found it not as bad as the reviews on here read. The room was not very small and it was clean, the beds were comfy and the toilet and the shower were clean. The staff were helpful though they do not know much English. The location is good, just a few minutes walk to the Hung Hom MRT and there are a lot of restaurants nearby. So we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend the hotel for budget travellers. So far the smallest room i could ever imagine........you dont even have place for two people to stand side by side.......once you get in the room you have to lie down on the ""so called Twin beds""...the so called AC is not effective n not controlled by you.....no place to keep your luggage......only small one bag it is OK....but more than one then you have to place it on you after you sleep...literally..and yes....lots of cockroach. DONT GO there even if it is offered free... I stayed here some time back, and booked the room over the net. Upon arrival I entered one of the smallest hotel rooms I have seen in my life! Upon presenting the print outs of what I thought I was getting, I was told that the pic's were of the DELUXE room. For about $80.00HK extra per night, I was give a room more than twice the size with a couch etc. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff for the most part were pleasant and helpful. It is a good 10 minute walk from the subway system, and there are heaps of buses at your doorstep that will take you anywhere you want to go, just get yourself a good map. The worst hotel have come across. Very arrogant and worst staff at night shift during my stay... Very very small rooms... worst room services... the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life...

iashraf,455420,"The hotel is located in the Bur Dubai area which is the old part of the city close to the Dubai Creek. The area is overcrowded and very noisey and also known as the red light area Directly opposite the hotel is a bus station and petrol station and also conveniently located is the carrefour supermarket. Taxi's are very easy to get, just stick your arm out and they'll be there. Not many taxi drivers knew where the hotel was so take a business card from the reception just in case. The hotel rooms were cleaned daily, however the hotel has a weired 'currey' kind of smell. The hotel staff were very friendly, however the lobby area was full of local people in the evening often visiting the bar where they had live entertainment till late night daily. The hotel staff will help you with excursions and arrange for pick ups to and from. Taxi's are very cheap. The main attractions are far away from the hotel so you'll have to heavily rely on taxis! We were glad when we were out and about and out of Bur duabi - if possible avoid staying in any hotel in Bur Dubai - there are many good hotels in clean and better areas of Dubai and trsut me it will ruin your experience of dubai staying at this hotel We stayed at this hotel for our honey moon in August 2008. The hotel price has gone up since, at the time we booked as package with flights from Expedia. We arranged a taxi from the airport who also picked us up on return - it was about half an hours drive or so. The sea is just across the road from the hotel, Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia are walking distance - less than 10 minutes but you will need to walk up the hill. The restuarants are also near by. The hotel served nice breakfast on the terrace from which you can see the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia and also the sea, get up there before the breakfast closing time otherwise you will be annoying the staff - trust me you don't want to be there! The terrace opens as a restaurant in the evening - but it was very pricey! The rooms are clean and spacious, TV, fridge and coffee making facilities available - the fridge was stocked up with drinks and snacks, we didn't realise that the fridge would be checked on checking out so we had to pay for the one or two things that we had consumed. Fast food outlets like McDonalds, Burger King and Pizza hut are available near the blue mosque as well as cafe's and restuarants. The grand bazaar is also closely located near the Blue mosque. The hotel is close to the train station which takes you to the point where you can catch aboat to go to Kadikoy - the asian side of Istanbul. If you are muslim, there are plenty of mosques around to pray. There was one in the same street as the hotel which was very convenient. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would stay again if we had the chance.","The hotel is located in the Bur Dubai area which is the old part of the city close to the Dubai Creek.

Pietro1970,228546,"Travelling with my wife and my six year old daughter I have been delighted by the warm environment of this hotel and the warm, friendly and professional personnel. The room was very functional, quiet and clean. The position is perfect to reach the Zoo at walking distance (15 minutes in a nice avenue) and close to a Metro station. Good breakfast. Swimming pool very charming. Gym club small but nice, clean and with good devices. Very recommended. Room at 1st floor on the main street was very noisy. Single bed room very small. Fridge-Minibar was broken and beverages were warm inside. Many tiles in the bathroom were broken, generally the bathroom needed a restructuring. Nice staff, fiendly (but with a quite basic English). Excellent price.","This hotel was quite good for me, just the location was not really near central Barcelona. However, the hotel was not far from the underground station and the local area was very safe and calm. The hotel's staffs provided good service and the room was very comfortable. I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. What I would really like to highlight is the great attention received by all the staff... specially the receptionists were really helpful at any question made, they answered with professionalism and enthusiasm... will repeat when I come back to Barcelona. Great hotel! Really clean and organized, has a simple but tasty breakfast, always served by smilly and really nice people. The room has nothing fancy but it's functional, clean and comfortable. Good working and easy free Wi Fi internet. Sounds like 'yeah, it's the minimum a hotel should have' but we all know it's not like this and it's really good in this hotel. All the receptionists I met there were extremely polite, always ready to help with any kind of information or service. The hotel is located in a very calm and friendly neighborhood with fast access to bus or metro that will take you anywhere you need really easy. Besides you can go walking to Camp Nou watch a Barcelona football match!! Well, i really liked the hotel, and if one day i'm back to Barcelona, I'm sure I'd be back to this hotel, and i advise people to stay there. was 4 days and on Hotel Castellnou, the Metro station is just 3 minuts from the hotel and around 8 minuts from the center, anyway most of the time i drive by taxi and it coust cheap between 6 and 8 EURO, the staff are very friendly and allways available to give tips and information about the City. Thanks Mr Jesu Rios for the help and all staff team. Hello.Dear Catalonia Castellnou. I was really pleased to have stayed in your hotel. My first hotel was not cosy as yours.It was close to everywhere where we want to see. Thanks you in advance for your service and for everything. im planing my second visit to your hotel , Gracias =) Room at 3rd floor, facing the main street. This was our second stay. Must admit that the first stay was more enjoyable. This time we were given a rather shabby room. The walls were dirty, broken tiles in the bathroom, etc, as some other reviews mention. Generally the whole apartment was in desperate need for a repair. The worst problem was noise - not from the outside, but from other guests on our floor. In our room we could hear everything our neighbours were speaking about. The most positive about this hotel is its location, near Tres Torres metro, which provides quick access to the center. Staff was friendly and spoke english quite well. If they choose to repair this hotel we are likely to return. Otherwise there are better options at this price. We stayed in this hotel for the last night after we came back to Barcelona. The price is OK, but the hotel offer the room on the groundfloor to us next to restaurant. We were woke up at 3:30am and 6:00am by the staff working in the restaurant. Very noisy... and not very friendly staff..we phone the hotel how to get there, and they just told us the metro stop and didn't tell us how to get there after the metro. Room at 1st floor on the main street was very noisy. Single bed room very small. Fridge-Minibar was broken and beverages were warm inside. Many tiles in the bathroom were broken, generally the bathroom needed a restructuring. Nice staff, fiendly (but with a quite basic English). Excellent price. I made a big mistake to come to this hotel after having stayed at another -- Gran Hotel Catalonia. I thought I would save a few euros trading it off with a few more stops on the metro away from the center, but I was bitterly disappointed when I came. The single room had a single twin bed and the room itself was not much bigger than the bed, topped with a small window facing an internal shaft whose curtain is permanently on, it feels like a prison cell, really claustrofobic. The room was on the 4th floor and I could hear very loudly when other doors open and close (with a bang) and when there is any movement in the corridors and perhaps also other floors. The metro is also not very convenient as the line which serves this stop comes only once every 15 min so although in theory you can reach Plaza Catalunia in 10 min, in practice it can take over 30 min. It's a residential zone, supposedly the expensive one in town, so there is nothing to do around and it really feels very out of the way. The hotel staff were friendly but unfortunately they can't make up for the poor rating I give this place. It was the first time we went to Barcelona and I found this hotel a very pleasant surprise. Everyone was very nice, the rooms were very tidy and clean, breakfast was great. They gave us very good tips of places to go... seemed like a very well managed place. We seriously recommend this hotel.",,,

Best choice in San Diego; especially a Hilton. Stayed here on business trips and the hotel is excellent for business trips. Staff is excellent and really helpful. VERY clean hotel. Best choice in San Diego; especially a Hilton. Rooms are otstanding as are the service staff. Convenience and quality restaurant cannot be beat. Great location. Montreal is COLD in the winter. Dress and plan accordingly.,"Stayed here on business trips and the hotel is excellent for business trips. Staff is excellent and really helpful. VERY clean hotel. Best choice in San Diego; especially a Hilton. I've stayed at this hotel for the past 5 years - it has been my home away from home. The staff has always been great! The exercise room is great for this sized hotel. The past month they have started redoing the rooms - the new look is beautiful! The hotel rooms look fresh again. Quietly beside a library and a Catholic church, this suburban hotel property has an exceptional staff, great food service team and well furnished rooms. We have stayed here a number of times and never been disappointed. Mike at the front desk is an accomplished professional. Housekeeping is attentive and responsive. ""Souplantation"" restaurant (fresh salad buffet) is an easy walk, as is a Mongolian buffet restaurant. Quick and easy access to I-15 without feeling like you're in an urban jungle. Clean, refreshing outdoor pool and well-maintained fitness room. We stood here for a quick weekend to look around San Diego. I am pretty picky about where we stay in fact I usually take a few days to find a hotel that we see all the reviews are good and make sure they say that the hotel is CLEAN! that is the most important of it all. I have to say that the Hilton Garden Inn San Diego Rancho Bernardo is ""clean"" the location is about 20 mins from the airport when we arrived the staff was friendly and offered us our choice of the three floors they have. We went with the first floor for easy access to the the outside parking but if you prefer they also offer underground parking. The lobby was nice and looked well kept. The room was a basic room with a flat screen TV a desk a sitting area and on King size bed which by the way was very comfortable. There is a knob on both sides of the bed that I have heard from some of the reviews that it is adjustable to make it firmer or softer if you need it. Ours may have been broken because it just kept twisting but it didn't matter the bed was great. Overall the room was very clean. There were no surprise fees at the end of our stay and it was really easy to check out with a feature that they offer on the room phone. We had a great stay and would stay here agian without a second thought. Good clean hotel though perhaps a bit dated. No free breakfast and of course buying it there is not cheap. Like most places in California, local & state taxes bumped the bill up much higher than the basic rate. A plus though was free parking. I happened to arrive late in the evening and found that my TV was non-functional; even checked the power cord and power button on the side of the TV. I could have called the front desk but was ready for bed and didn't want to sit up waiting for a maintenance guy, so I just let them know on the way out the next morning. Reception and rooms are well presented. A good pool area and other amenities are perfect. The bar is a bit small for groups on some evening and it closes a bit early but there are plenty of other watering holes nearby. I've spent 10 nights here over 2011 and will be back. Better value for money and of higher quality than the nearby Radisson where I've also spent a fortnight in 2011. For a last minute overnight inthe SD area...clean, well maintained rooms and got a deal on Priceline. Nice place. We have family in the area and typically stay here, primarily for it's location and value. The staff is always very accommodatiog and helpful. It is the ideal location near the center of Rancho Bernardo. We have been impressed with the considtency over many years. We should also note that it tends to be ""Wedding Central"" in RB. Virtually everytime we have visited on a weekend, there are wedding parties booked, so you might want to inquire. We stayed at this hotel for 11 nights from 27th August 2011 and had read many reviews prior to booking. We stayed on the third floor (top floor) and asked for a room facing away from the highway which runs to the side of the hotel. The room was clean and very quiet and we did not encounter any noise problems. The hotel was in a good location for us as we had relatives in Escondido and Ramona and also wanted to spend time at the beach and in downtown San Diego. It was about a 25-30min drive to Del Mar which was a quick and easy route to the beaches. All in all, would highly recommend this hotel and didn't experience any negatives that would not make us want to stay in this hotel on the next trip to San Diego. Liked: - Modern nice rooms - Free internet - Free parking Didn't like: - Noise from highway (request a room not facing it) and some heating/ventilation system noise noticeable - Breakfast not included ($10/person), at least when using HHonors rewards - About 30 minutes from San Diego (mostly highway) This Hilton Garden Inn is everything you'd usually expect from an HGI. The service, rooms, everything is good. No complaints there at all. The only warning I'd give other travelers is that it is a bit of a drive from downtown San Diego. If you're staying here for business in Rancho Bernardo, it's perfect. But if you're coming to be a tourist, it's 30 mins away from SD without traffic, so just plan to do the drive every day. The only main tourist attraction that's closer to this hotel is the San Diego Wild Animal Park (which is awesome, by the way, better than the actual Zoo in downtown SD). I often stay in HGI while traveling. This was a typical design. Rooms were quite spacious. The woman that checked me in was friendly. The room had a couple small problems: the clock radio was workable but damaged, and the drain in the sink was very slow. Not a big problem, but not what I expected. The restaurant was quite busy in the morning and it took a while to get someone to serve me. Overall, I'd stay there again, but it was a worse experience than other HGI I've stayed at",,,

Cons: no alarm clock in my room, no extra shower light/heat lamp, bathroom door sticks on the bath rug, .....obviously these are minor!!! The staff were very nice and accommodating and just lovely!!! The breakfast was hearty and well-stocked, lots of teas, hot oatmeal, waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, pastries juices, coffees, etc. Shuttle to/from the airport was prompt (just remember to reserve it for the hourly departure when you want to return to the airport). 24 hour free business center to check email and print boarding passes and all that stuff was very helpful, too. Really, Liz, Lisa and her staff were just wonderful for our family wedding party! And, before, I forget, there are other hotels and a restaurant/bar within walking distance as well as the Sam's Club. A slightly more difficult walk, due to a cross street, includes a liquor store, Mexican food shop (bought the birthday candle there), a gas station and a few other little shops. The staff are always cheerful and friendly, the food was excellent from the catering staff. The internet service was free if you sign up for the frequent guest program!

Lots of mirrors and good lighting, and a sunny window with nice sheers to keep the room from getting too hot. Also, the mini-mart downstairs had everything you could need, cereal, soy milk, maps, it was great! The service was fantastic there as well.

All in all, I would like to return there to enjoy it for vacation! lovely hotel with beautiful furnishings, not all rooms have tubs, some are walk-in showers and you should specify if you have a preference, but they don't tell you that; the business center is $6.75/15 min session, but boarding passes can be printed free (and you can check in as well without charge). In room safe is large enough for a laptop. The perks include free morning coffee/tea service in the lobby, 4pm choc chip cookies (limited supply) w/ milk, and evening wine service from 5-6pm. The restaurant's breakfast service was a bit slow, or was it our waiter, don't know, but the food was tasty. Dinner was excellent at the same place however, and the kitchen is open till 10:30pm.

When I found out I was already enrolled but couldn't access the site I was again told that I had to deal with it myself even though when you turn on the TV it clearly states to ""enroll at the front desk"".

Regarding the common areas, dirty elevator, worn finishes, horrible looking substance laying on the base of the bellman's cart (appeared to be fresh vomit or some other sort of bodily waste), limited breakfast items (we were looking for bananas and were told by the breakfast attendant who was sitting eating breakfast himself in the dining room that they had not shopped for him and therefore he was out but that we should try banana yogurt instead), Snow so deep you really needed boots even though it had not snowed for 36 to 48 hours and they clearly had not plowed or had only plowed minimally, very few parking spaces since most were evidently dedicated to ""park and fly"" customers since most of the cars had not moved since before the snowfall, old car parked under the canopy, never moved, etc. etc. etc. I would expect this out of an economy hotel or independent but clearly need to be wary of Wyndham/Wingate in the future as well!!!

ebking22,302996,"Spend 2 nights here with my family. This is not a resort, it is a business travelers hotel. However, I was not there for business, but a rest after hiking the canyon. This hotel was perfect for me. The staff were incredibly friendly. I felt completely at home and we did not even leave the hotel all weekend. We ate all our meals there. The old cigar bar is great to eat in and watch football. There is also an outdoor porch to watch football and order food/drinks. It is pretty noisy out there- but I wasn't bothered by it. I guess my one complaint- was my bed was completely crooked. It was weird- it tilted sideways. I still slept fine each night but it was weird to wake up towards the end. The rooms are also not that big. They are comfy, but not any more luxurious than a Marriott. But- the staff by far are superior to any other hotel. I have never stayed at a Ritz before- but now I understand why people always speak so highly of the Ritz customer service. It was incredible how nice all the employees were. The location and price cannot be beat at this hotel! You are literally walking distance to everything and several metro stops, the roissybus at the opera that takes you directly to/from the airport for 10 euros. The owners are incredibly warm and friendly. Fresh baked pastries each morning makes it feel like you are staying in someone house rather than a hotel. Not to mention jams that are made from the owners orchard. The jams are delicious and I looked forward to them every morning. The rooms are small (by large American standards), but this is Paris- so all room are small. But in every way this hotel is the ideal place to stay. I spent 5 nights there and after the first night I felt very at home. There is also a friendly little dog named Tokio- who will make sure you eat all your food. Even though the hotel is in the heart of paris (1 minute walk to the Madeline, 5 minute walk to the Concorde, 10 minutes to the opera, Les Halles) the street becomes totally silent at night. Spend 2 nights here with my family. This is not a resort, it is a business travelers hotel. However, I was not there for business, but a rest after hiking the canyon. This hotel was perfect for me.

This is a great little hotel with delightful friendly staff and a fantastic location in the centre of Paris. Reasonably priced for Paris too. Ten minutes walk from the Roissybus stop at Opera, five minutes to the Madeleine metro station which goes everywhere and within easy walking distance of the big shops, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and good restaurants. Despite its central location the street was quiet and we slept well. I visited Paris recently for the visa application and stayed at the Hotel La Sanguine. It was chosen due to its convenient location, cost, and the reviews avaiable here. The staff are indeed very friendly and helpful, as indicated by some of the previous reviews. The room was typically compact (for a single visitor) but very comfort and clean. The area was pretty safe as evidenced by the policemen on duty for various consulates around. Just a side note, there is a post office (La Poste) just around the corner and the staff there are familiar with the topics for the visa fee and envelope - this is a great help for some one like me who do not speak French. At first quite a small room and a lot of stairs to the 4th floor, however the most amazingly friendly staff and fantastic service. Very helpful and knowledgable. Fantastic location right in the centre of Madeline. Close to the Louvre, Obelisk and the river Seine. Wonderful restaurants close by and easy walk to supermarkets, shops and a short walk to most attractions. Would recommend this hotel to everyone I know. I LOVED IT!! Our first trip to Paris enhanced by the family atmosphere at the Sanguine. This is the most ideal location in all of Paris. Nearby restaurants of all degree of stars,ideal shopping variety,safe walking neigborhood, and hotel staff that instantly becomes family. Only steps to the first Lauduree! Think of a true Paris experience when staying here because space is minimal, but the convenience more than makes up foir the lack of extra square feet. Great start to each morn with the tasty and elegant breakfast spread. Excellent tips on sightseeing from the staff. No finer concierge in Paris than Nicole! Zagat dining within walking distance like Sederens, Tante Louise, and the always busy soup, salad and sandwich place directly across the little street. Easy access to Diet Coke for those of us who value it. Staff replenishes your fridge daily with it at reasonable price. This place satisfies the traveler and does leave money for those treasures you must bring back home. My sister and I stayed at La Sanguine for 3 nights as it was recommended by a friend. Without having been to Paris before we were worried about staying in a safe area. I would highly recommend it's location. It was a very safe area and was within walking distance to all of the main tourist attractions. The shops in the area are fantastic, and we enjoyed dining at a lot of the restuarants that were nearby. The people who run the hotel were fantastic and were very friendly and helpful. The room was small, but it had everything we needed and was always very clean! I will definitely be staying there when I go back to Paris. The location is superb. We needed a quiet hotel close to the Grand Palais for the Monet exhibition, in early January. La Sanguine provided small comfortable rooms. They were also cosy and warm. Stairs are not a problem for us, so the absence of a lift is not an issue. The staff were very helpful and their excellent English made up for our just passable French. This is a 2 star hotel and a very good 2 star hotel .If you are looking for large rooms and all the decor of the boutique / 4+star hotels then don't expect a small 2 star Parisien hotel to fulfil that expectation. Breakfast, as in most French hotels is overpriced compaired with lunch menus- but that is France. Having said that, the continental breakfast at La Sanguine was good. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay here. We stayed only one night at La Sanguine and loved it. The 8th Arrondissement area is quite upmarket, and perfectly situated for having a good look around Paris. The manager, Jean-Patrick, was charming and took all our bags upstairs without hesitating. He was also a very amusing man, and his English is probably better than mine. The rooms are small, but we had no trouble keeping our bags out of the way and us out of the way of the bags.. The rooms are very comfortable, very clean and extremely nicely furnished. Our room had a stunning bathroom, recently upgraded, and carefully designed to utilise the space adequately and well. We had decided to travel without a laptop (big mistake) but the Hotel La Sanguine has a system whereby you borrow a laptop from them for half an hour and use wireless in your room. For no charge. That was enough to do the online check in for our departure and it was the icing on the cake for us. The breakfast was a very cheerful event, as well. We are not 5 star hotel people, and probably never will be irrespective of economics. We firmly belive these small, well situated, and comfortable hotels are the best way to travel because of their (usually!) innate friendliness. This one wins hands down. La Sanguine has no lift, which may not be good for anyone with a disablity, but with only three floors and a helpful staff this poses no problems for the more fortunate others. I went to Paris with 3 other friends for holiday and we stayed here. Let me summarize my review in point form as follow: - The staff are amazing. They are very nice, informative, helpful and accomodating - The hotel is located walking distance from metro (either Madeleine station, or Concorde station) - There are many great cafes and restaurants nearby, feel free to ask the hotel staff, they will be more than happy to recommend places to eat, they will even make reservation for you should you need their help. - The room is small, but for the price we paid and the excellent service we had, the room size didn't really matter at all - There is no lift in the hotel, so you got to prepare to carry your own luggage up the stairs - You can try the hotel breakfast which cost only 10 to 13 euro, they also sell a very nice Bordeaux wine for 7 euro a bottle. - Look for Madame Nicole or Madame Josephine, they are really nice ladies and if you love dog, they have a cute dog named Tokio. If you are looking for a simple hotel with great service and hospitality, I strongly recommend this place. It felt like we stayed in a local Parisian home with a local family, who happen to speak perfect English. The hotel is situated on a quiet side street, so sleeping was no problem! It was easy to find and to walk to from Madeline underground. The location is great as it is very central, and you can walk to Le Louvre as well! What really made my stay was the staff. The were lovely to talk to and put a smile on my face every day! They went out of their way and beyond to help me and gave me all the information that I needed to have a great time in Paris. The rooms are small but they were comforatble and it added to the charm of the place! We would always stay at this hotel, having had multiple stays here already. The staff are so so friendly, we travelled with 2 other couples and were totally satisfied with our rooms, we are under no illusions as to the size of hotel rooms in Paris, or anywhere else in Europe for that matter, so the room size was not a problem. Location couldn't be better, we do a lot of walking so absolutely ideal for us. AND a member of this family is a fan of the All Blacks. Thanks to all the Staff for our wonderful memories of your hotel. We;ll be back one day, soon. Agree no lift but wouldn't deter us.",,,
Carol B,243366,"Not only was the double bed, 2 camp beds pulled together, the threat of neck ache because the TV was on the ceiling, was never a problem as it did not work. Ability to addrress a complaint zero. Sad They are far beyond my expectations to create a wonderful atmosphere and ambiance for a vacation! I loved every minute at the Wynn! We spent nine nights at the Hotel de Londres Eiffel. It was convenient to metro, bus, and rail service. Our room for two singles was comfortable, clean, quiet, and nicely decorated.

Very clean, and comfortable. All the same ammenities of being at home. Will definately return. Great stay Every year I go to Rancho La Puerta on vacation and every year I stay at this Hampton Inn the night before. Since I travel from New York it pays to leave one day earlier and spend the night at Hampton so I can arrive bright and early at Rancho La Puerta for the day's activities. I've recently included reserving a room after my stay. Instead of rushing to the airport the day my Ranch week ends, I stay at the Hampton Inn and relax, browse the local shopping and choose one of the many restaurants for dinner within walking distance of the hotel. It's the perfect way to end my vacation. The staff is warm, friendly, and extremely helpful. Victor, the Manager, is a real professional -- he gets the job done and always has time to say hello. The rooms are tastefully decorated and kept immaculate...and the bed and bedding are luxurious. If you call from the airport, a van will pick you up and return you when your stay is done, all complimentary. This hotel was a lot of fun and the room was very comfortable. Most of the staff was attentive and they offered a lot of amenities for no charge. The common areas were very noisy for an older couple, but would appeal to younger travelers. When we walking into the lobby there was a DJ in the ""living room"" with music pumping and lots of people mingling and having a great time. The hotel elevator had tech music blaring and the bar also had a lot of music. The decor was beautiful, the bed very comfortable and the exercise room was adequate. They named everything different ""cute"" names, so I didn't always know what to call things. Definitely a hotel for the under 40 set. Only problem was the closet door which locked shut the first morning. My husband was able to put together a decent look with clothes outside the closet for his meeting, but I had to wait 2 hours for maintenance to open the door so I could dress for the day. They didn't fix it before we checked out at 3PM. Seemed to be more a problem with the front desk than maintenance. Finally, my husband thought he was saving money by parking about a 1/2 block away at a garage not affiliated with the hotel. The posted in large print was for guests of another hotel. I would recommend that you use the hotel's parking. Went for a 2 day trip for my anniversary. Very clean, and comfortable. All the same ammenities of being at home. Will definately return.

We decided to opt for this hotel after the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor and we werent disappointed !!! The hotel is hidden away with a fairly small entrance however once inside it has everything you need including great staff. Our room was great, not huge but enough space for eveything. Lovely bathroom....very italian. Happy hour was a good way to relax after full days of sight seeing, the cocktails and bar snacks really hit the spot.

The accommodations are clean, quiet and adequate; the location near Marble Arch provides easy access to the Underground, busses, restaurants and many other services. Our 14 night stay could not have been more pleasant. If you require luxury and extensive service there are other far more expensive hotels in this neighborhood.

The hotel is great to travel to all local sites a great base in Suffolk. Food and rooms are great. I booked to stay at this hotel through lastminute.com during October 2010. I was attending a function in Mayfair and was running tight on time when I arrived. The main hotel door was locked and there was a note saying 'back in 5 minutes'. The receptionist eventually turned up only to inform me that the the twin room I had booked and paid for was already filled and there was no other twin room available. Luckily there was a single room available but I was kept at least 20 minutes whilst he tried to sort the booking (even though I stressed that I was late for the function). No apology was offered or a refund for the cheaper room as he said it was lastminute's fault (a fact that I now know not to be true). The small single room had a lumpy bed and a weak shower that sounded like a hair dryer (probably about right for the money though). The hotel did eventually offer a 25% discount on a future stay but I will certainly not be taking them up on their offer.",,,
Katie24_12,1212582,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary on a Saturday night. As soon as we arrived we were treated like royalty and the staff could not do enough to make our stay special. We had our room upgraded, which had a great view of Regents Park. The room was wonderfully decorated and felt very homely, with candles lit on our arrival. We had the best mojito ever in the bar, and then proceeded to have dinner in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, with every course as good as the next. We found it hard to choose what to eat as it all it sounded great! It was very reasonably priced for top class food.

Holly on reception was so cheerful and helpful as were all of the people working there throughout our stay,We had the suite and could happily of stayed in the room, the bathroom was sheer luxury under floor heating a huge shower etc, the lounge in the room consisted of sofa, coffee table, leather easy chair and a large TV, a large desk and chair, a most comfortable bed, every single detail ie lighting, accessories, toiletries was perfect, as a surprise by our son and his gorgeous girlfriend it had been pre arranged for strawberries, dipping chocolate and a bottle of fizz to be waiting in the room for our arrival. I would highly reccommend this hotel A huge thank you to Gordon Ramsey and all of his staff for making our stay just perfect My husband and I stayed at The York and Albany on Friday evening as a treat, a night away from redecorating our home and a long week of work. Arriving alone, I was greeted with a warm welcome and shown to our beautiful suite, Room 4. Separate from the main house, up a small flight of stairs to a roof deck and cute wooden door into the entrance porch. The suite itself was fabulously warm and the lighting created a perfect ambience. Having stayed before, it was great to see the little touches that have been added to the rooms; a lovely welcome note on the bed, a jogging map and the smell of jasmine candles really making you feel at home. The bathroom is stocked with White Company products, thick white towels and a huge shower. The Suite really has everything you need to ensconce yourself away for a night. However, rather than a cosy night in with room service we headed to the bar for dinner. I was escorted by reception to the bar and introduced to the bar manager. Once my husband arrived we were swiftly shown to a cosy table in a corner. Our dinner was fantastic and the staff very attentive, my mushroom and chestnut pasta was particularly delicious also the dessert of salt caramel divine. After an uninterrupted sleep in possibly the most comfortable bed ever we went for breakfast in the bar, its open from 7.00am. Greeted by the same staff as the night before, it was lovely to receive such a great welcome again. I would recommend The York and Albany to anyone looking for great service, a warm welcome and good food. Weâll be back and when the in-laws arrive in the summer weâll be booking them in too! As the lucky recipient of some Gordon Ramsay vouchers for Christmas I went on to Gordon's website to book dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay BUT to my sheer delight discovered that he has a townhouse in Regent's Park. No question what won! We checked in a bit too early but not an issue as we were given a table in the bar. The menu is so diverse and as we had a dinner reservation for the dining room and I wanted to save myself for the Rib-eye we happily shared a pizza at the same time enjoying a cheeky glass of Prosseco. After lunch the lady on reception checked us in and we were delighted with our room. I travel on international business so the room was perfect for us as it was a home away from home as opposed to a carbon copy of one modern room does all. I understand from Holly our receptionist that all the rooms are different which is very me. A beautiful Regency building and it honestly felt that we were just staying in a very rich friends townhouse! We went for a bracing walk in Regent's Park, laid on the bed watching afternoon TV and then back to the bar for cocktails. Dinner didn't disappoint and we had an amazing table on the rich red velvety banquette opposite the pass. Outstanding mussels would you believe cooked in Camden ale followed by the Rib-eye. I was in food heaven and full so I only had room left to share a super treacle tart with clotted cream. It was really nice actually because it was clearly Gordon's level of cooking BUT the service was really grounded and informal. Rolled on upstairs and slept very well; perhaps at the prospect of a full English breakfast with lashings of tea! To me this was the perfect gourmet experience and I just totally relaxed. I was treated to a night stay at York & Albany for my birthday. Iâm a fan of Gordon Ramsay so was really looking forward to staying here! I must say I really enjoyed myself and would certainly go again and recommend it! The menu was actually very reasonable and bar/restaurant itself really is gorgeous. My partner had told the receptionist we were celebrating my birthday, they really looked after us and we were even given 2 glasses of Prosecco and a birthday plate. We had heard about the signature pizzaâs before which are cooked in the deli. So we had pizza and Prosecco! All really good and the team there are great. We had a peak at the restaurant downstairs which sits in front of the open kitchen, quite a unique view. (Trying to persuade the boyfriend to take me back there on Valentineâs day!). The townhouse bedrooms are stunning and breakfast also didnât disappoint! We had a really nice stay and to top it off walked down to Oxford Street for a birthday shopping spree! We stayed here on our wedding night. My wife told them that when she booked. We weren't expecting anything, but something to mark that might have been nice, if only some congratulations or acknowledgement - nothing was said. Â£180 for the room, which was v standard and small. No breakfast. No prestige bath products. Sink in the room leaked. Boiling hot room. Someone started hoovering outside our room at 8.30am on a Sunday morning. The lift outside our room made this very loud and long repeating beep noise whenever it arrived - absolutely no idea why any lift would have such an irritating and intrusive sound, let alone one in a hotel! The bill was reduced to Â£150 but there wasn't much of an apology - I would definitely avoid this overpriced rubbish. I doubt Ramsay's organisation take the time to read these reviews (of which I note there are many) but his venues do not confer any exclusivity or high quality on your experience, yet still carry the price tag. Poor I booked the hotel as a surprise for my husbands 30th along with dinner at Maze Grill. We were welcomed on arrival by friendly and professional staff and informed we had been upgraded to a luxury room. The room was lovely, comfortable and well styled with a four poster bed and quirky bathroom. We found the service to be excellent and although there was a mistake on our bill it was quickly rectified with no fuss. My only regret is not having the time to try the picnics or spend more time in the bar sipping cocktails - definitely plan a return visit.",,,
ianatbragg,197527,"Cheapest hotel we could find in the area. Argentine metro stop was in front of the hotel. We landed at Paris Beauvais-Tille airport from Madrid (Ryanair) and a 45min shuttle bus took us to Porte Maillot, Paris. It was only a 10min walk to the hotel from there. The rooms were small and had no air conditioning or ventilation. Our room was #114 facing the street. If you opened the windows, you would not be able to sleep at night due to traffic noise and the cigarette smell from the restaurant in front. The bed was comfortable and the toilets were clean though cramped. TV was small and no english channels. The room had a small fridge. If you don't mind the accommodations which we really didn't because it was just a place to rest up for the next day adventure, then this hotel is ok. We're not picky. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel for E9.00. Not worth it. The front desk spoke english and helped us out with directions. Wifi was not free. One thing I really liked is that they kept our bags for us after checkout since we had time to walk around Paris before our flight back to Madrid. Around the area, there were a lot of good restaurants, a self-service wash, internet cafe and within walking distance to Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. We even walked from the Eiffel back to the hotel. I did not expect this hotel to be this good so close to the airport. We booked it really cheap and was not expecting much. Shuttle passed by our terminal (Madrid-Barajas airport) when we arrived at 10pm. We didn't even need to call although the email said that we should. Wife and I were amazed by the room and the facilities. The room was modern with ample amount of lighting. Bed sheets and pillows were comfortable. Toilet and showers were clean and had the complete toiletry kit. TV had English channels and we even had a balcony. Curtains were really dark. There was a microwave by the front desk and some vending machines. I also saw a desktop computer for internet access by the front desk and it was a minimal fee to use it. There was a bar, tennis court and outdoors eating area for breakfast. We missed breakfast so I couldn't tell you if it was any good. Hotel was only about 5 min away from the airport. We walked around the neighborhood and it was safe. The front was a school and the hotel was next to a park. Burger king was 5 min away (closed at 1am) with a few bars and restaurants that looked like it was full of locals. They were still open and it was almost midnight. There was a convenience store behind the burger king for water and junk food. I will stay here again when in Madrid airport. Cheapest hotel we could find in the area.

The bed was comfortable and the toilets were clean though cramped. TV was small and no english channels. The room had a small fridge. If you don't mind the accommodations which we really didn't because it was just a place to rest up for the next day adventure, then this hotel is ok. We're not picky. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel for E9.00. Not worth it. The front desk spoke english and helped us out with directions. Wifi was not free. One thing I really liked is that they kept our bags for us after checkout since we had time to walk around Paris before our flight back to Madrid. Around the area, there were a lot of good restaurants, a self-service wash, internet cafe and within walking distance to Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. We even walked from the Eiffel back to the hotel.","Cheapest hotel we could find in the area. Argentine metro stop was in front of the hotel. We landed at Paris Beauvais-Tille airport from Madrid (Ryanair) and a 45min shuttle bus took us to Porte Maillot, Paris. It was only a 10min walk to the hotel from there.

We even walked from the Eiffel back to the hotel. The rooms are small and a bit dated, the bathrooms tiny, but the location is just perfect. We were in Paris for 3 days only and we walked everywhere, the location was so central. Breakfast was excellent, too, with the croissants coming from the yummy bakery next door, I guess. I would stay there again anytime. I was trapped in Paris during the volcano so my short trip was extended. All 15 nights at this hotel. The rooms were clean, typical smaller European rooms, no air conditioning, the staff was helpful and the location was fantastic. The Argentine stop, Line 1, is only feet from the front door. Line 1 takes passengers from La Defense, to Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, etc... Breakfast was typical, 8 euros for a continental breakfast: coffee, bread, butter, croissant. Best Features: location, good price for Paris Negatives: somewhat small rooms, the walls are a bit thin, no air conditioning Overall, if you are looking for a np frills, European hotel in a great location, and budget friendly for Paris, this is a good choice. In hot weather, I think the rooms may be uncomfortable without air conditioning. so this hotel we picked because it looked the nicest of all the ones in the price range. glad we picked it if the others would have been worse. small room, but does suffice. no noise from the street unless the window was open. no a/c so it was a bit hot. not ""two steps"" from the arc du triumph like they say. take the subway to the argentine statiion to get right outside the hotels door. breakfast simple but pricey - grocery store across the street is cheaper. you do have to leave the key there, cant take it with you when you go out for the day. bathroom small, handheld shower head, no shampoo provided. did walk from here to the louvre and notre dame so it is possible .",,,
jl747-13,497528,"I stayed here while I was on tour in January 2012 for two nights. It was a typical Best Western, comfortable but nothing special about it. It was a little ways from the centre of Amsterdam, but public transport stopped less then five minutes away from the hotel. The rooms were clean, and modern, and there was a decent breakfast served in the morning. All and all it was a decent hotel. It was a very good hotel, by far the best I had on my trip to Italy. The staff was helpful and nice. The rooms were pretty modern. It had wifi and a decent breakfast. The only problem is that if you want to get into the centre of Rome it is difficult. It either means catching a bus and a train. Or paying a good deal of money for a taxi. It was a okay hotel. The two major problems with the hotel was the fact that they only had wifi in the lobby and the staff was not very helpful. It was also pretty far from the centre of Berlin. But, other then that it was fine. The rooms were nice, though if you stay here try to stay on one of the bottom floors. I was on the top floor and only one elevator went to the top so it took forever to get to my room.","The hotel is so far from the center that does not seem to be in Rome. The area is shabby, so it's not an attraction to go around after prolonged meeting. 4 stars hotel does not have swimming pool, spa, pool table. The meals were quite poor, little selection of everything, no fruit, no tea, for hot breakfast there was an omelet once in four mornings! Rooms are clean, but ac system does not work even in meeting room. I have found nor kettle, neither single glass or cap (even plastic) in my room for four nights stay. Reception people are extremely unpleasant except of blond one (seems to be Laura). They pretend to be very busy and you have to wait for their attention for a long-long time. There are numerous 4stars hotels in the world which could be used as schooling for Idea Hotel Roma Nomentana keepers! It was a very good hotel, by far the best I had on my trip to Italy. The staff was helpful and nice. The rooms were pretty modern. It had wifi and a decent breakfast. The only problem is that if you want to get into the centre of Rome it is difficult. It either means catching a bus and a train. Or paying a good deal of money for a taxi. This was the worst hotel ever in my life.i have been many timesa in rome and the most of the times staying in idea z3.so we thought idea nomentana will be the same.it was tottaly awful and with no relation with the other hotels.the hotel is far from everything the rooms are dated and the hotel has no life and no lights at all.i believe this hotel needs an absolutely renovation.it was smelling,cold a night mare.we were booked another 2 times in the same month in the same hotel but we immediattely cancelled them and we stayed in z3.much better.avoid it we went in end of September 2011. was hard to find at first but later we find it very easy About 30min from centre of Rome To get to hotel take line b metro and get of on rebibiah metro station (its the last one anyway) then go to big pedestrian crossing and find up the road bus 451, 311 and get off when u see big building with TREME sign on it Then just go across the street down the road and you found it. Great breakfast very tasty Selection of cereals, cakes, eggs and many more. room basic but nice and clean Would recommend it and would go back I stayed here for two nights with three friends. We had a large room and we all had separate beds and they were quite comfortable. The bathroom was also of a decent size. We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel at first though due to the sign at the entrance being tiny and the sign at the top of the building is for something completely different. The free parking and nice new TV were great bonuses. I'd read that it was far from the centre of Rome but it isn't as bad as I was expecting. Just a short walk down a few roads (max 20 mins) to a Metro train station which takes you really quickly into the centre. The train was only 4â¬ for an entire days use which we thought was great value. The breakfast (which was included) was nice but due to the amount of peeps it all disappeared quite quickly. Luckily the amazing staff members were around to continue bringing out more food. One of the staff members was generally amazing and was so awake, cheerful and polite it was really infectious and a great way to start the day. During a 10 day stay in Italy, my wife and I and another couple booked a room for one night that we were told would sleep four. Well, instead of two double beds or even a double bed and sleeper couch, we got what we were told- four walls (a room) with four literal cots, a desk, and a 20 year old television. The walls were dull eggshell color and were scuffed and damaged. The bathroom was tiny. We complained that this was unacceptable, but were told there were no more rooms. About 30 min. later we got a call that they had found another room. This room was the same size, however recently renovated. The bathroom was much larger and it had a flat screen TV. However, the sleeping situation was still deplorable. Somehow they define cots as ""beds"". There were two singles and one full size double. They barely sat 12 inches off the floor. It is evident that this building was originally office or even industrial space that someone has tried to convert to a hotel. This results in atleast two two-foot diameter concrete columns invading each room. In addition to the aesthetical shortcomings, you must take a bus to get to the subway to get into town-very inconvenient location! In spite of the foregoing, the staff was polite and courteous, but this did not make up for the overall poor experience we had while staying in this ""hotel"". This is my fourth time staying this hotel, but they have a room preferation problem. The room is very nice and clean on 3rd floor, but they put only 3-single bed instead for 4-person as per my room reservation (quadropla 2-singole & 1-matrimoniale). I suggest to put additional 1-single bed but they says that no more chambermaids on duty. All they have to do was to a find a room that suit to my reservation - room 114. A very ugly, dirty painted, broken door on c.r., bedit water leak and defective beds. A great experience for us, but there's nothing we can do instead to be content because we're only temporary - 2 nights huh! Please upgrade your service in term of room preferation. I've been in Rome in December 2010 and I've chosen this hotel because it had a very low price. I've payed 125 E for 3 nights and in my opinion the distance to the city center is compensated by the good price and the conditions offered for this price. I've seen some negative reviews for this hotel but i have to say that my experience was positive. I had a big, clean room with a clean bathroom, the breakfast was great and the public transport was good as well. The trip from the hotel to the city center takes about 35-45 minutes and costs 1 E. One has to take the bus (341,350 or 311) to Ponte Mammolo or Rebibbia metro station and then the metro to anywhere else. The bus station (Galbani Negroni- second stop on Galbani street) is a few meters away. Near by there is also a small complex (super - market , gas station, sweets store, pizza restaurant). The hotel was clean and modern, and our room was comfortable modern and clean BUT to get into rome you need to get on a public bus and go on a trip through the residential streets just to get to the metro/subway. The subway stop is like the last one on the line. If you want to have nights out in Rome itself (lets face it - there isnt much AT ALL happening around this hotel) , you'll have to get a taxi and they arent cheap - and the drivers are crazy. The hotel is just too far out if you are going to Rome for sightseeing as you take up too much time trying to get in and out of Rome - at the end of the day when you are exhausted and your feet hurt you dont want a whole nother adventure just to make it home. Wouldnt stay here again for that reason.",,,
leex1080,627797,"We were just at the Hyatt and we got a good deal via Priceline name your own price. The grounds and room was very clean. Easy distances to the Bay, Sea World, and everything you need to see in the area. We got a ground floor hotel not part of the tower. I loved it as we got an outdoor space with a firepit. My only complaint was that you have to pay $20/day for parking (ouch!) and for internet. I guess I am use to having free internet so that was a big bummer.

There is always staff at hand so that was great. They were super nice and friendly. Only thing was the building next door was having construction done on it so it did get a little loud- no fault of the hotel. It was also in walking distance of the Metro so it was really central. I'd stay here again.","Stayed here for 10 days. Nice and Clean property in an excellent location of Paris. Friendly staff always available for help. The main attraction was that metro station is just few steps away (200 mts). Will love to stay here again! We stay here for 7 nights. The room was small - but that is expected - but clean.

The room was large and had a decent-sized bathroom for Paris. Everything was clean and simple with a welcoming family-run feel. Excellent location, Montparnasse is lively and central, but not a tourist trap. Paid around 80 euros/night for me and my boyfriend; much nicer than a hostel! We got a discount for staying on the main floor (still decent courtyard view from window) and 12 euros off for the third night. The concierge recommended a nice bistro, though the neighbourhood is filled with restuarants, cafes, bars, creperies, and bakeries of good quality - they aren't just filled with tourists. I would certianly stay there again. It is not near the river but it is walkable. Metro, train, and bus station are close. Farmers' market a block away - 2 days a week. There is a charming neighborhood walking street nearby with many bars, restaurants and shops. The hotel itself is very nice. The owners go out of their way to provide information on restaurants, directions and cultural activities. Very accommodating! There is a computer provided in the lobby for guests. The breakfast is excellent and worth the money. A lovely small moderately priced hotel tucked away on a quiet side street just off major roads, near public transportation to all points in Paris and Charles De Gaulle Airport. Numerous restaurants a short distance away, including Chez Papa, a real find for great food at moderate cost, recommended by the hotel owner. Room and bath were small, but very comfortable. No air conditioning, so summery may be warm. Breakfast only, but very good. Greatest assets are the proprietors, Francois and Frederique La Vaillant, who are very friendly, very knowledgeable about Paris, and always helpful. They are also very patient and answered our innumerable questions. A very nice experience that made our brief stay in Paris all the more enjoyable. At last we found a nice little hotel in Paris !! Nothing fancy about it but the staff is lovely, everything seems to be simple and clear. We stayed on the first floor so no need to get on the tiny tiny tiny little elevator ! The room was just the right size, facing the courtyard so almost no noise. The bed wasn't perfect but fine. The bathroom is a bit dated but again clean, fine. The area is great, 10 minutes on foot from Denfert (direct train from Roissy), same from Montparnasse... This hotel was great - the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and the location was good. A bit of a walk to the attractions but the metro was across the road and the walk through the streets were always interesting anyway. We will stay in this hotel again next time we are in Paris. Pros - little elevator so stair climbing not necessary, free wifi, guest computer in lobby, soft toilet paper, husband spoke English well and was helpful, windows kept out street noise well. Cons - bed really low and hard, bathroom could have used some cosmetic touchup in the grout areas, wifi problem half a day, wife didn't speak English, high charge for breakfast, $120/night not a budget price.",,,
PatUNH1980,88159,"I stayed here for 3 nights at a conference in October. I really liked the lobby and layout of the shops, restaurants, gym, etc. Very compact relative to most of the large Vegas hotels. The gym was fantastic- one of the nicest I have seen. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The rooms was very nice and high tech as the hotels claims. While it was nice to have electronic controls for pretty much everything, I felt that the controls could be far more intuitive. Being in my 30's, I couldn't see anyone over the age of 55 being able to navigate the multiple menu options. The bathroom was nice, but the water pressure in the shower was lacking. Overall, it would be hard to be unhappy here, but I personally prefer the Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian/Palazzo over the Aria in terms of the hotel. If my expectations were slightly lower, I would probably have given this a 5 star TA rating, but I expect a bit more from a 5 star hotel. I stayed here for 3 nights at a conference in October.

The hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the location was easy to get in and out of. I will definitely stay here again when I am in the area on business. I stayed here fro one night before flying out of LAX. You can't get much closer to the airport or the rental car returns, but you can barely hear the jets. The rooms are huge, comfortable, and modern. The staff was helpful and very efficient. The free breakfast and cocktail hour are the icing on the cake. We had a very good stay at this hotel. The included breakfast was excellent, as was the complimentary in-town shuttle service provided by the hotel. The room was nice, but felt random in terms of the finishings. We lucked out with a large corner room, but saw others that were not as spacious. The bar also had very odd hours, which I was strange for a city hotel.

The hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the location was easy to get in and out of. I will definitely stay here again when I am in the area on business. The staff were great and very helpful. They gave suggestions for dining and knew the area. Our room was clean and neat with everything on good repair. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the sheets. The pool was a bit cold but we asked about it and the temperture was turned up! Breakfast area was well stocked and kept clean. There is a lot of dining and shopping near by and is in a great location. I wanted to do some Black Friday shopping in Indianapolis and chose this Hampton for it's location near Castleton Mall. Other than location, I have little else positive to share. The staff was nice enough but the sheets needed to be replaced, our room shared a wall with the indoor pool so we could hear everyone at the pool, and the breakfast had stale bagels and hot OJ. I definitely won't be staying there again. We have spent a few nights here at various times when we visit the Indianapolis area. Each time, the staff at check in has shown that ""midwest hospitality"" by being friendly and helpful with any questions we have ever had about nearby restaurants, shopping, and directions. I wish I would have written down their names so I could tell their supervisor about how welcome each of them has always made us feel. The rooms are nice...some have been better than others, but that's like any other hotel. The beds are comfortable, room size is average but perfect for us as we don't spend much time in the room, and the bathroom is sufficient for two. The complimentary breakfast is always good and the dining area is clean. There are two nearby restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The Thai Orchid is a good choice if you like Thai food, and Charleston's is a nice casual restaurant with a varied menu. The front desk staff of the Hampton will give you free coupons for Charlestons if you ask them. We have never used the pool, but it's indoor and doesn't ever seem to be very busy. The hotel is located in the perfect location if you are planning on shopping at the nearby Castleton or Keystone Fashion malls. There are a lot of nearby choices for shopping, eating, and movies. Horrible Smell from both the room and the customer service here. After putting up with it the first night, the smell in the room got much worse. I brought this to the attention of the front desk, who sprayed something on the carpet and said it was not that bad... but since she was not the one staying in there I don't think what she thought matters too much. Her manager was not much more helpful since the manager was trying to make me pay for the room... despite the smell. Hopefully we can work this out in the morning. -Poor Customer Service -Horrible TV's (crackling and fuzzy) -Poor cleanliness -Not very comfortable bed -Horrible smell This hotel is close to the shops & restaurants in the Castleton area. The staff wasn't particularly friendly upon check-in, and the pool is rather small, but the rooms are updated and clean. We slept well, but my husband's complaint was that we have better TV at home. The flat screens aren't high def and the channels are limited. The free breakfast is a nice touch, but I'd rather pay for better quality -- the fruit salad was canned and there was no real half & half, just the small creamers. Stayed from 9 to 11 August. Several issues add up to detract from my stay at this property. Constantly blinking message light on phone, but there were no messages. #3 on the phone did not work, so I could not call 2 different numbers that contained the #3. Reported the phone issues 3 times with no resolution. The unreliable phone concerned me about my wake up call on 11 Aug, but it arrived as scheduled. Prior to checking out, I was grossed out by a large stain on the mattress sheet. Not to be graphic, but it was a stain one might see in a honeymoon suiteâno, I did not cause the stain. Did not notice the night before because I just crawled under the covers, but I did notice the obvious cigarette burn hole in the bed cover. This was a non-smoking room, but there was a stale smell of cigarette smoke. There are 3 entrances into the hotel. Of course, the one most convenient to my room was out of order, so I had to take a longer walk to access my room. There is a major railroad crossing adjacent to the hotel. Could hear passing trains at least 6 times in 2 days. A special train passes thru this crossing 17 times a day 6 to 22 Aug, so that may have been the train I heard. Nice LCD TV with good variety of stations. Free WiFi is secured with an access code. It was stable, but slow. Had to use Skype because my roomâs phone did not work, but Skype barely worked because of the slow connections. There is only one accessible electrical outlet built into a desk / workspace. Limited the options when using my laptop or to even plug in an iron. Large breakfast served in the lobby, and there are a couple of computers with printer in the lobbyâs front corner. There is a major shopping mall, movie theater, and wide variety of fast food / casual dining restaurants. I live in the real world. If 1 of the issues occurred, I would give a higher rating. This many issues in the same place, at the same time, makes me glad I was traveling solo. If anybody had been with me, I would never hear the end of it. My family stayed here for a karate tournament. The staff was very courteous and friendly. They have gone beyond what would be normal expectations. The hotel was very clean and the free breakfast buffet was good. The had hot and cold options. The staff went beyond that one staff member offered to bring a customer her waffle to her table while it cooked so that they did not have to stand there and wait. Little things like that make the stay worthwhile. The hotel had an indoor pool and also swimming toys for the kids to use (diving sticks, beach ball, etc..) which was great for our kids. We enjoyed our stay and would come back again! We stayed here on our way back from a family wedding. We had stayed 2 nights before at the Hilton down the street. I thought the Hilton was a little nicer and it was actually cheaper, but the Hampton was nice too. We stay at Hampton's often, as we find that they are usually a pretty reliable chain. The room was a bit cramped, but still nice. If you are looking for a place to stay for a night as you pass through, this would be a good choice. Always love the Hampton's complimentary breakfasts- better than any other hotel. Walked in and smiling faces and very helpful staff started the experience off the right way. The rooms were clean and the pool was very relaxing and having a fitness room was a big plus. The free breakfast of eggs, bacon, and potatos was amazing and had something for everyone with the warm food and also donuts and orange and apple juice. Perfect location to get on and off the highway plus restaurant galore to choose from. The management staff was very nice and took great care of us with any concerns we had. Easy internet access made it nice to catch up on things away from home.",,,
ysndyr,231642,"we have made a reservation from the internet for ITB Berlin fair.When i see the photos i was not sure about do i like the hotel or not but when we arrive the hotel we understood with my friends that was right choise.building is very old and nice like all berlin but very wide and comfortable rooms and very good location.and especially thanks for all receptions all of them was great peoples very smiling helpfull and friendly.definitelly i can recomended this place. Before i go i read tripadvisor reviews and i was not sure about the hotel but that was definitelly not bad.We cannot say perfect because hotel need some renovation but cleaning,helpfull reception,location everythink is enough.I like that hotel and i can recomended this hotel if you went to madrid because in madrid you'll not need to stay in the room to much because city is very attractive all the day and night till morning and if you go for vacation you use the hotel only some sleep.","We didnât expect much from this budget hostel/hotel when booking as it was very cheap and the other reviews werenât particularly glowing, however, my friend and I were pleasantly surprised. Located right next to the metro and close to all the nightlife the Aparthotel Tribunal is so close to the action. The downfall is that the rooms are a bit dated but the beds are comfortable and the staff are accommodating. I wouldnât recommend this hotel if you wanted to spend a lot of time in your hotel but if you only want a bed to sleep in and are planning to spend most of the time taking in the sights of Madrid, I would recommend it. The hotel was very central, close to the Gran Via, metro stop (tribunal) just outside of the hotel which was very handy, we used the metro every day to get around the city. The hotel itself was very dissapointing, it was very old fashioned and our room had little light and fresh air. The air conditioning did not work and it was too noisey to keep the window open as the city never sleeps, the bin men woke me up one morning at around 5am. The room was clean though and the towels were changed each day.There was renovation work taking place when we stayed which were not previously informed about, every day we had to dodge ladders and paint and step over uneven floors, I actually got paint on a top which I wasnt too happy about. The staff on reception seemed rude but it could have been the difficulty in communication? The workmen worked from 0800 am to late at night, call it our personal alarm clock as they worked just below our room, banging away. There was no bar or cafeteria in the hotel so if you wanted even just a drink of water you had to walk to the nearest shop. Madrid itself is great, I would recommend going to the Zoo, they have lots of different animals including Panda's and Dolphins, the Dolphin show was good. If I went back to Madrid I would not stay at this hotel again. Obviously for this price you could expect something of the kind but I think they could freshen up the rooms a bit. The furniture is quite old and what really put me off was the absence of kettle, what you get instead is water heater, which doesn't boil the water. Hah I never even thought something like this existed. Additionally, for some reason they removed the hotplate stirrer, so if you decide to use the hotplates for cooking you'd have to stop by the reception first ... Other than that the house keeping lady cleans cleans the room every day, it's in a very central location with good metro connections and good places to eat. Wi-fi password is provided upon request (free of charge), there's a late check-out (after 12 pm) and the hotel offers luggage storage in case you have a late flight. Two things that completely put me off were 1) bad customer service 2) no wifi in the rooms negatives 1)When I checked-in the room we realized the room did not have A/C on. It was a hot day in mid may and with my 1yr old baby I wanted a room with a working A/C. So, when I inquired they replied that ""May is spring time here and A/C does not have to be on. You can look for other hotel."" they know with a baby we can't look for another hotel at the lat minute. absolutely regret my stay there 2) they advertise free wifi but its range is limited to the lobby. 3) Rooms are old 4) they charge extra for using stove in the kitchenette Positives: location is nice Overall opinion : never will recommend this place This aparthotel is located in the middle of the action near Fuencarral and within walking distance to major Madrid's attraction , Gran Via, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, and shopping areas. There are plenty of places around to eat and the subway (tribunal station) is just a block away. The only thing is that it is very old, and the rooms need to be refurnished ASAP, the front desk were very kind, we had an inside rooms, so there were no noise at all and room were cleaned everyday If you do not mind to stay in an old building, but do mind to be closer to action, this is it. Great Price also. As a regular customer of this hotel I feel somehow annoyed for some reviews that call this place ""a dirty backpackers shelter"". There are backpackers, specially I've seen them when i have been there in summer. But there are professionals and families. Furniture is old, that true, but rooms are cleaned everyday carefully. Location and a helpful staff are pluses as well. I like this hotel..... Ok if you want a fancy wall high headboard in just the right Pantone for this season it's not for you. But if like me you spend weeks going between hotel rooms that are to small to open your case AND walk to the toilet then book in here. The reception have always been helpfully and polite (even when I'm arriving back at 4am) the rooms are not modern but they are clean and BIG - sofa, coffee table, small kitchen all at your disposal. It could do with a paint job but really the walls are unimportant im more intrested in being comfortable for a week when staying here. Maybe not the hotel for a romantic break, but perfect if your on business or traveling solo.

The only thing is that it is very old, and the rooms need to be refurnished ASAP, the front desk were very kind, we had an inside rooms, so there were no noise at all and room were cleaned everyday If you do not mind to stay in an old building, but do mind to be closer to action, this is it. Great Price also. Horrible, old, smelly and dirty backpackers shelter!!! Avoid it!!!!! ...if u still intent to get through this horrible experience, mind that wi-fi has signal only in the lobby, against stated in-room. Based in one of the nicest areas in Madrid, lovely restaurants, cafes en shops nearby. Also next to the metrostation 'Tribunal'. A simple hotelroom with outdated furniture and decoration, but everything worked fine. We didn't bother to use the tiny kitchen with sink, 2 electric cookers, and fridge since there are great restaurants all over the neighbourhood. Rooms got cleaned every day and friendly people working at the reception. Thin walls and during the weekend some noise outside, but that's what you'd expect in such a vibrant area. Before i go i read tripadvisor reviews and i was not sure about the hotel but that was definitelly not bad.We cannot say perfect because hotel need some renovation but cleaning,helpfull reception,location everythink is enough.I like that hotel and i can recomended this hotel if you went to madrid because in madrid you'll not need to stay in the room to much because city is very attractive all the day and night till morning and if you go for vacation you use the hotel only some sleep. Its located right above the metro station TRIBUNAL. Gran via is within walking distance( 5 to 7min) from the hotel. you can take the hop on hop off bus from the gran via. the major shopping street with all the major brands store is right out side the hotel. there are several grocery stores and cyber cafe's just outside the hotel.The rooms for 60 euros are decent and clean. The kitchen is well equipped. mind you that there is no room service and no restaurant in the hotel. the staff at the reception is well versed with English and are eager to help you. we stayed for 4 nights here. Ideally located in Madrid, close to Tribunal metro station, this hotel made a good base for exploring Madrid. We had two rooms which were actually two connecting apartments. Very spacious. The apartments are in need of some updating, but were very clean and quiet. Very good value for money, especially for families with older children, who need a bit more space, without cramming into a quad room. The kitchenette is suitable for making a coffee, and has a fridge.",,,
Sir_Top-Hat,497636,"The Grand Moov is in a side street in Deira Dubai. The rooms are of good size (I got upgraded to a very spacious room during one of my stays) clean, and with sufficient amenities. The one draw-back is that if you are in the lower floors, you are bound to get quite a bit of noise from the nightclub at the floor level. If you can, try to get a room on the higher floors, away from the corner the nightclub is in. Stayed in the York for 3 or 4 nights, during a business trip. Hotel is nicely located in the centre of Bur Dubai (although there are currently road works in front of the hotel, making it difficult to stop in front of it) However, the rooms are quite bad (small, old, and not very well kept) and quite a bit of noise travels up from the (very busy) nightclub in the lower floors. Room rate included breakfast. However, I would have done much better eating anywhere but at the hotel! Not a horrible experience, but there are better choices. I stayed twice at the Imperial suites (the 2nd time was an unavoidable accident) The rooms are indeed very large (sometimes with a separate TV/lounge area) and might be handy for large families willing to room together. However, for a single traveller, they have absolutely no added value. There is a very loud nightclub at the ground floor. And you cannot escape the noise, even in the top most floors. If you must stay there, at least try to get a room in the opposite wing to the nightclub for a (reasonably) quiet night. Maybe there are reasons to choose this hotel. I just cannot imagine what they could be? Arabian Park is a relatively new hotel, with rooms decorated in a modern theme. Room size ranges from reasonable to spacious (I was upgraded in one of my many stays) The balcony in the higher grade rooms are very nice. However, each floor has a vast lounge with a common balcony. Depending on which side your room/balcony faces you might get some great day/night views of the Dubai cityscape. Cleanliness and service were always top notch. My requests for ice (since the mini bar wasn't really providing much refrigeration) from room service were always provided with a smile, and free of charge. One small issue in the bathrooms is the lack of curtain or full size splash guard. The whole bathroom tends to get soaked after a shower. I appreciated the complimentary in-room tea and coffee. However, free internet (in this day and age) really should be a standard service (it wasn't here!) The location of the hotel can be a bit frustrating. Although not far from most destinations in the city, it is slightly isolated. This isn't an issue if you have a car, and taxis are most of the time available at the door. However, your cab driver might find it a tad difficult to get there the first time. This isolation, on the other hand, and the fact that there is not a night club on premise, allows for a quiet sleep. Something that should not be taken for granted in most Dubai city hotels! The Panorama Deira (not to be confused with its sister hotel, the Panorama Bur) is a very basic budget hotel. The rooms are worn down, and this affects the general cleanliness. The room had just been repainted when I stayed. And there was a strong paint smell which didn't really improve the overall experience. The location is not bad, if you want to be in Deira, but nothing spectacular. I never returned. You can do much better. This is one cool place! the hotel and rooms have an interesting modern character. As long as you like this, you will not be disappointed by the rooms. Good size, excellent amenities, including down comforters and pillows. Unfortunately the the property is starting to show signs of wear and tear. If you are not bothered by the slightly old looking carpets, or the occasional scratched surface, you cannot go wrong here. The location -in a beautiful residential neighborhood in the ""old south"" quarter- is perfect. Only 10 to 15 mins from all the attractions with the tram that goes by the front door.","One of the place to avoid if possible. I stayed 4 nights, service is way below poor. The room was below average. They have a few restaurants to choose from. for those who are budget consicious this can be a good property locatd at a gud location where travel also becomes easier....Service is also quiet good but since most of the time one stays our on sightseeing it actually does not matter ..as for me i found their service upto mark in whatever time i spent in this Hotel and enjoyed my stay with my better half to make aade my dsf experience better....... Me and My Husband were in Dubai this December for our Anniversary.We had booked a Standard Room. But one look at it and we wanted out. The room was Suffocating and without any proper ventilation. The carpet gave an unpleasant Wet clothes stink. It was divided into 2 parts, One as bedroom and other as living with an old tv. We immidiately requested the reception to upgrade us or we would change our hotel. Fortunately, The hotel staff was helpful so they upgraded us to a better room with no division. this room was clean with no unpleasant smell of any kind and a better bathroom. Food in the buffet on the 8th Floor Ballroom was good but with limited variety. Pool was under construction. Overall, An Average Experience on Stay. This is a good hotel if you are travelling with family. Very cooperateive staff, reasonable travel desk who will give you good offers for sightseeing. This hotel is surrounded with lots of shopping options, Indian food, and has public transport option. Airport pick-up was complementary. Breakfast is very good with Indian cuisine. Rooms are very spacious and that too for such an attractive rate. But please bear the loud music that can be disturbing. The hotel is ideally located in Bur Dubai with a range of vegetarian options on walking distance. The rates inclusive of Breakfast & airport transfers make it a very good deal. The hotel was in good location. But the water was cold, after few days we informed the Manager who was really excellent I think his name is Mohammad he arranged for that to be fixed and also gave us a fruit basket to make up for it. The rooms could do with a kettle, tea and coffee facility. I went to the night club next door just once and was astonished there were so many asian women waiting to pick up men (more like prostitutes). Expats come in to unwind, the moment women see these guys, they all crowd around them, most disgusting. The expats refuse them, then the women make fun of the guys. Don't trust the tour company Starlite Tours, they rip you off if you are an expat, make sure to haggar. The hotel is absolutely horrible. The smell in the rooms and all around the hotel is so bad that you cannot sleep. The rooms are extremely dirty. The hotel is full of prostitutes. its like one hours love hotel in hell. Its incredible to believe that so lousy hotel can even exist. Worth the money for the stay. Except if you are with family, do not prefer to be in 1st floor . Rather take from 3rd floor and upper floor onwards. Rooms are neatly maintained and clean. Except for the complimentory breakfast. It is just ok only. Free airport transfer service and the chauffeur was well mannered. Location is excellent. Excellent Location and Luxurious Rooms. Easily accessability to DWTC , Metro Station and the place has plenty of supermarket which is opened 24 hrs. I found room are spacious and good. Music lounge on the Lobby level is excellent which goes until early morning. Staff are quite courteous and helpful. Very conveniently located and extremely cozy rooms. Good food and breakfast. It has good restaurants and a pub offering great night life - if you are will to spend other wise good food and music for the less adventurous. Every room consists of one spacious living room and a cozy bedroom. This hotel is so bad and it is only for PIMPS,S E X ENJOYMENT AND FOR W H O R E 'S & S l u t . As i am solo business traveler to Dubai And working whole day and need good sleep all night but in this hotel all the nigh is like NIGHTMARE all the s e x workers in bur duabi is available in that hotel. THE WORST HOTEL ARE YORK INTERNATIONAL ,RAMADA & IMPERIAL SUITES. If you stay for long time period you will see the same weekend peole coming from Mumbai ,Delhi & Ahmedabad for 2 day sex visit. And owner of the hotel is also from bad background. I WILL NOT RECOMMED FOR FAMILY ,SOLO OR DECENT BUSINESS PEOPLE. I stayed twice at the Imperial suites (the 2nd time was an unavoidable accident) The rooms are indeed very large (sometimes with a separate TV/lounge area) and might be handy for large families willing to room together. However, for a single traveller, they have absolutely no added value. There is a very loud nightclub at the ground floor. And you cannot escape the noise, even in the top most floors. If you must stay there, at least try to get a room in the opposite wing to the nightclub for a (reasonably) quiet night. Maybe there are reasons to choose this hotel. I just cannot imagine what they could be? A double room cost us Rs 5000 during the shopping festival, but the room was actually a luxury suite with a separate living room. It was comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet spread, however, was disappointing. I had read about late night music coming in from the disc which was a tad true as our room was almost directly above it, but it wasn't loud enough to be seriously distracting. A good idea would be to ask for a room on the opposite side of the disc. Meanwhile, the disc really is somewhat of a pick-up joint as is the dance bar next door, but their entrances are separate from the hotel. The hotel has other decent restaurants as well as a lounge bar. All in all it's a safe bet, especially with the innumerable Indian tourists staying there. The location too, is great. It lies quietly in the middle of the street, surrounded by decent malls and eating joints. It's conveniently located vis-a-vis other attractions in the city too. A word of advice: Avoid Star Tours that has a travel desk in the lobby. We found them expensive and unreliable. There are other travel agencies around the hotel or a call away. The Sun & Sky agency, about half a kilometre to the left of the hotel on the same road, was especially good. Although the suites are clean and decent as well as the food served being good, this hotel has a bar downstairs with blaring loud music till late at night. The bar also serves as a pickup point for call girls so the hotel is an absolute no no for families..",,,
diaperchanger01,224228,"I have stayed in this hotel a number of times. However, when the new manager took over some months ago, things started to become overlooked. We stayed this last time and to be honest with you, was taken back by the filth that was evident both in the rooms and around the grounds. In our particular room on this stay, the carpet was worn out and had become detached from the tiled kitchen area. Each time my children walked across there barefooted, they walked across carpet tacks. The bathtub had ""unspeakable"" hair in it. There is spots of mildew and mold growing in the bathroom. The air conditioning wreaks in this room of urine/smoke. We have learned over the past 2 years to take a can of Febreze or you will not be able to tolerate the smell. The beds are like sleeping on the floor --probably would be better off on the floor. The carpet is simply put -- DIRTY. The grounds of the hotel needs a scrubbing and someone to pick up cigarette butts, etc. The staff needs a lesson in customer service as they have and will continue to be less than ""polite"" at this location. The manager and I have been in screaming matches before over her attitude. I simply will not stay in this motel again, even though it is convenient in location and excellent in price. 2 years ago, I had a different opinion, and it's truly a shame. This property has so much potential, if only it were discovered. We have been staying at this location for some time now. First, the staff at this location is incredible. The front desk clerks know us by names, know our situation, and does everything they can to accomadate our needs. The double rooms are very roomy for the price. The free hot breakfast is wonderful as is the dinner. The business center has always been an asset to us since we are gone from home for such long periods. I cannot say enough about this property because the staff has made us feel at home. We travel so much, but this is where we feel closest to our own home. My children and I stayed at this hotel with my mother for our trip to DFW for medical purposes. The lobby of this hotel is spectacular. The rooms are spacious and the shower is a place I would like to live in! :) I found the entire stay excellent. The shuttle driver even took us to the airport, parked out by the runway and allowed my young children to watch planes land and take off! Where else would you find that kind of service! It was wonderful, thank you Wyndham Hotel!","i read all the reviews before i left, it was even better than i imagined. i was there for 6 days on business. nice rooms, 2 seperate areas, living room- kitchen with fold out bed, and bedroom with bathroom, both with nice tv's. plates, silverware, coffee, tea, micro popcorn, salt, pepper, cream, sugar. breakfast and light dinner were very good, and the price was right, free! the service was very good. Stayed for business. I have stayed here before, but since my last stay the rooms and lobby have been updated. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast and dinner with wine and beer make this place a bargain. Great location if you are visiting the market center. Below are my ratings for this property on a scale of 1-5: Hotel Location 4 Hotel Lobby 5 Hotel Restaurant/Breakfast 5 Hotel Customer Svc 5 Room Size 5 Room Carpet 5 Bathroom 5 Cleanliness 5 Cost/Value 5 DÃÂ©cor 5 Average 4.90 I've booked a block of for the June and January markets for myself and associates for the past ten years. This year I've called 2 or 3 times and e-mailed 2 times to try to get the rooms as in the past. I was told there was new Sales Management in place and they would get back to me. We always enjoyed staying there because the staff was so good to us. However, I have decided that we are no longer valued as a customer since no one has responded to my request. Therefore we will be going somewhere else in January for market. We chose this hotel because they had apt style rooms with 2 beds and a sofa sleeper. Very pleasant surprise when we actually saw the room. Plenty of room, 2 full baths, and a full kitchen. Only drawback was the first floor of the apt was on the 2nd floor of the bldg with no elevator (3 50+ women had to carry our luggage up the stairs). Complimentary breakfast was good. Front desk staff were mostly friendly and very helpful with things to do and places to go. Our stay at this hotel was mostly great until the morning we left. Hotel room was clean enough (the bathtub had some hair in it). We had a kitchinette that we didn't know about which was nice. And the front desk staff were awesome! Remembered my name, always helpful, etc. The are isn't great. You can't really walk anywhere as it is surrounded by freeways/highways. The breakfast was pretty awesome for something that comes with your stay. The fitneed center was minimal on equipment. Also, if you fly in the larger airport in Dallas the cab right is a little expensive and takes about 15-20 minutes. The bad news... The water was a little tempermental the whole time. It is hard to find the right temperature. But the morning we left, when we had to get up at 4:00am and things were already unpleasant we ended with no hot water. I think this might have ruined the stay for me. Because the water was touchy the whole time I am going to assume this wan't a one time thing. So there you have it. I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone because of the water issue, which is a huge issue to me. For business, especially at the Dallas Market Center, this place is great. Travelled to Homewood Suites for business trip. Front desk staff pleasant and courteous. As with all the Homewood Suites, breakfast and evening reception were great with appropriate foods. Room overall was spacious and clean. Nice to have separate living and sleeping areas. Only drawbacks were that the air conditioning unit was a bit noisy and internet was difficult to connect. No major or minor complaints. Will definately seek Homewood Suites when traveling. This hotel frequently has very competitive room rates, and offers perfectly acceptable accommodations. Access is a little tricky from the south, as you have to do a U-turn under I-35 and come back to the hotel, and the parking lot entrance is easy to miss. Only other piece of advice is to ask for a room toward the rear of the building - the rooms at the front face I-35 and traffic is audible all night, even on the upper floors. It didn't bother my college-aged kid, but it bothered me. This is a 3 star hotel, and I was a little apprehensive since we usually stay at the 4-5 Start Hiltons. I was EXTREMELY PLEASED and would totally stay there again. The breakfast was great, room great, and they were totally nice to my 2 little boys. The staff was unbelieveably responsive. They all had their A game on. The shuttle took us several places, and we played games in the dining area infront of the fireplace. They really had the ""home"" theme going in a clean and professional manner. They really went above and beyond. I have been converted to a big fan! Great for famlies, business, extended stay. We have been staying at this location for some time now. First, the staff at this location is incredible. The front desk clerks know us by names, know our situation, and does everything they can to accomadate our needs. The double rooms are very roomy for the price.

RipplesGuy,2514992,"For travelers visiting University of Illinois or attending meetings at the adjacent conference/meeting facility, this is a comfortable, brand-standard property. There is a local pizza place, ""Monical's"" as well as an asian restaurant, McDonald's, and Subway all immediately nearby and several more restaurants less than a block away. The Walgreens adjacent to the hotel's parking lot was also very convenient. I found the staff to be very friendly and the gals in the restaurant at breakfast were especially cheerful. I am normally very sensitive to noise and there are train tracks that run parallel to Neil Street; however the 3-4 trains that I was aware of did not blow their whistles and came through fairly quickly. I'll admit I was a bit nervous when I looked at the location on the map because I feared it would be a noisy location right on Pike Street next to the interstate. I requested a quiet room and they found me a room on the courtyard side that was just fantastic. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and during my 4-day stay they frequently greeted me and inquired about my adventures about town. They were quick to answer questions and accommodate a few requests. They even provided SUNSHINE on a couple of days (oh wait, that may not be able to take credit for that....). The location was excellent. I was able to take the light rail from the airport (40 minute ride for under $3? yes please), and then walk 5-6 blocks to the hotel. I rented a car one day from the Hertz counter a block away, and jumping on the interstate was a breeze. The iconic Pike Street Market is an 8 block walk down the hill, and if you walk a few blocks east you're in the heart of the Capitol Hill District with all kinds of food and shopping. The convention center is located next door, and a very unique urban park built over the interstate provides a fantastic place to escape is integrated into the landscape with remarkable precision. A delightful bonus that I enjoyed several times. If you aren't familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, not only do they serve a hot breakfast but also a light dinner Monday-Thursday evenings that is a great deal especially for weary business travelers who might not feel like venturing out at the end of a long day. One last thing for people who ARE familiar with the Homewood Suites brand. Many of the properties I've stayed at have a more ""country home"" feel to them in terms of decor and layout..this place is very classy and reminded me more of their ""Hilton Garden Inn"" sister brand within the Hilton brand family.

I like having a chair with an ottoman near the window. The University is literaly mintues away, great location. There was a convention one of the of the days we were there and the ample parking dwindeled down considerably, the only slight downside, something to think about. We had breakfast at the lobby restaurant which was very good. The servicers were friendly and attentive. They should have better coffee in the room, I wasnt impressed, no offense Wolfgang Puck. The room and halways were very clean and light well. You can see they take care of the hotel. The lobby was exquisitly homey. The pool was small but warm and clean. The whirpool was equally pleasent. They didnt have the ""best"" work out room: free weights, ~5 treadmills, 1 (old) elliptical, and a few ramdom weight machines, so i didnt use it. All in all a great place to stay. OH the best part was the laundry room on our floor, the 4th. They kept it clean, and they were obviously new machines, yeah! You need Quaters for soap, wash and dryer. $1 each, not bad.

I am normally very sensitive to noise and there are train tracks that run parallel to Neil Street; however the 3-4 trains that I was aware of did not blow their whistles and came through fairly quickly. This is my second stay in this hotel within a month. I chose it again because of the location and availablity. The hotel is adequate, but the service may sometimes be on a brusque side. Most annoying, however, are the noises in the night (although it may not be a problem if you are, unlike me, a very sound sleeper). The refrigerator in the room kicks up for a few minutes from time to time, one can hear water running in the neighbouring rooms, and there were also some noises I could not identify the source of. The hotel maids are not supposed to knock on your door for cleaning on the morning of your check-out, but they did and woke us up (on the other hand, we should have remembered to put up a don't disturb sign). They are also a bit too economic with the toiletteries in the bathrooms. I stayed here while visiting UIUC. The room was comfortable and the internet fast enough. I was not amused to find that there was no room service for breakfast since I was on a tight deadline. Other than that, the breakfast was good - much better than at another Hilton Garden Inn I stayed at the following week. Recommended. I stayed at this hotel for two nights for the purpose of visiting UIUC. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient at completing hotel check-in. As there was no one else going to the airport prior to our meeting, the hotel shuttle drove my colleagues and I to the university; it also drove us back to the hotel from the university after our meeting. This was indeed a pleasant experience! My room was spacious, very clean, and equipped with free WIFI (another plus considering most hotels charge for this internet access). The room was rather cold at the beginning (similar feedback from another colleague) but once I set the thermostat to 'heat' mode, the temperature in the room was acceptable. As to the minor negatives, I was certainly aware whenever the guest(s) in the adjacent room showered. However this seemed to be a common problem also at some of the higher-end U.S. hotels that I had stayed in. Also, the breakfast selection was not great. In summary, I found it comfortable enough and value-for-money for a short stay. Champaign's Hilton Garden Inn is a decent business class hotel. Staff are courteous. Although the gym is small, it is well equipped. The proximity to campus is good if you are in town for a football or basketball game. There are no great hotels in CU, however, the Hilton Garden Inn is head and shoulders above other hotels in town. We stayed overnight on a driving trip to the Midwest (and did the same two years ago). It's not all that convenient to the Interstate, but worth driving a few miles for a good night's sleep. There is a park a block from the hotel which is a good place to get some exercise after a long day's drive as well as a nice residential neighborhood for taking a walk. The hotel restaurant is adequate for dinner and breakfast if one doesn't want to leave the property to eat. The bed was excellent and the room and bath were very clean. The only complaint was the fan which was a bit noisy, but if it was turned off the room could get a little stuffy. The small business center has a computer for guests to use. I'd happily return for another stay. We stayed here one night while attending a reunion. Well-located for I-Hotel functions, Assembly Hall and Stadium. Front desk staff cordial and welcoming. The room was pleasant, if a little small, with an excellent bed and very nice bath. Amenities in room were good including high-end toiletries, nice bedding, fridge and coffee maker. Wireless internet worked very well. Housekeeping disturbed us at 9:00am despite sign on door. Not a good thing. Only other complaint is that the toilets in this hotel are the pressure flush style and and are quite noisy and can be heard from other rooms as well. Overall, a good stay if a bit pricey at $122 (incl. tax) for a short one-night stay in a fairly average room. Recommended, but try for a better rate when reserving. For Champaign, may be upscale. I found the room to be nice sized with free internet access. For longer stays, nice to have a small fridge and microwave. I also enjoyed that our room did not have a bathtub (don't need to step in and out nor was there a shower curtain). But, noise from the hall seeped into the room, dark room (poor lighting and small windows). Could hear toilers flushing from other rooms. I am not a light sleeper by any means but the noises are distracting.",,,
fdipace,98627,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and each time it gets better. The hotel is located near Turtle Creek and Oak Lawn. If you enjoy older classic hotels this is a must. The doors and walls are solid, its like sleeping in a huge Mercedes! I've never heard any noises from other rooms. The furniture although an older classic design is beautiful. The bed is extremely comfortable and so is the linen. The marble bathrooms are fantastic. Although an older property everything works great...water pressure,water temperatures, A/C, internet, flat screen tv etc. Usually older hotels are noisy and have inconsistent water pressure and temperatures...not at the Melrose. It is first class. The bar is a must, don't miss it. There are several casual eating establishments in the area but you will need to drive for more upscale restaurants. Parking is a little steep for the area but at least your car is safe. If you are gay the hotel is in the heart of the gay village. Check the hotel for specials you would be surprised at the rates. Enjoy, I can't wait to return. Just checked out of the hotel and was pleasantly surprised especially since I only paid $64/night. The room was not huge but it had a sofa and a large flat screen tv with a good selection of channels for a hotel. I had to move for business to the Embassy Suites at Market Center and I already miss the large flat screen tv. The Courtyard is not in the best area but it is easy to get on and off the highway, parking is free. The sheets were clean and although I don't like foam mattresses it was fine for sleeping. The A/C is the wall type but it worked great even though it is a little noisy. Although the hotel was full I didn't hear a thing in my room. Not sure why each room has a balcony because there is NOTHING to look at! I guess this would be good for smokers. The gym is small but the treadmill worked fine. Internet in the lobby didn't work well. I think they charge for breakfast but at this price who cares. Overall well worth the money. The hotel is in a good location for accessing Dallas sites and businesses however if you need to work while here the Internet connection is slow and erratic dropping connections often. As a diamond member I was upgraded (a first for a Hilton property) to a larger suite which had a huge bathroom with a large tub. Unfortunately the elevator decided to stop working on the way to the room so I was stuck for a while until it decided to resume working. I tried to call the front desk but they just put me on hold and never answered. Although being suites the furniture and TV's could stand to be upgraded. Flat screens would be welcome. Central A/C works great but you cannot set a certain temperature. I usually stay at the Sheraton Suites a few blocks away although they charge for parking and the A/C stinks the room is modern and the hotel has a lounge. A weird design of the Embassy Suites is the massive A/C fans outside your window, they make a lot of noise. I can see how light sleepers would find this annoying. On the plus side of this hotel is the breakfast and afternoon reception with free beer, etc. Overall OK.","My family and I planned a last minute trip to Dallas for the weekend and this place was right in our price range. The rooms were very clean, and big enough for my family of 5. We did not have time to get in the pool but we could smell it from the entry door, which was comforting to know that they were using the right stuff to keep it clean if we decided to use it. The staff was absolutely wonderful. They were courteous, quick and loved my daughters. They even rewarded them for being so quiet and polite during breakfast. Their breakfast was my only complaint. We got downstairs about 40 minutes before breakfast was over and there was not much left and we had to wait for more food and clean glasses. Since we had to pay an additional $10 for it they least they could have done was have it ready and plentiful for those who paid. Would I stay again because the hotel was very clean and well taken of and for the money we spent it was worth it. Not to mention that Alfredo, the gentleman at the front desk, was very kind and helpful. My parents live in Dallas and celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary this past weekend. A block of rooms was reserved for us at an outstanding rate of $49.00 per night. I've stayed here before, but I thought I'd update my reveiw. The hotel is immaculately maintained. If you've been in one Courtyard, you've been to this one, so no surprises here. I must say that the bed was too soft. I had a back-ache from our 15 hour drive and frankly the mushy matress did nothing for it. Everyone else liked the beds though. I'm a weirdo who likes a hard bed. Nice big bathroom, great water pressure, plenty of room to spread out and enjoy life. Kids went in the pool, and I enjoyed a nightly soak in the hot tub. There's one washer and one dryer on the property at $1.00 per load. Went to the laundromat down the street and did my wash there in very short order. Starbucks is to the right at Webb Chapel. Movie theater is there too. Quick Trip next door is an awesome convenience store with hot and cold food items (that are very tasty) and probably the best donuts anywhere. Very reasonably priced (as opposed to The Market) Our maid was awesome never disturbing us, the front desk did everything possible to help us out and even gave us some pennies for a game we could play on our trip back to Atlanta. There's a Motel 6 one exit before this, but at the same price, is there any contest? Check-in was handled efficiently by a very pleasant front desk person, who provided a warm greeting, recognized my Marriott ""elite"" status, and got me checked in quickly. My room was typical, traditional-style Courtyard, - very clean, with 2 double beds, desk, bureau with flat screen TV, and closent. Bathroom was clean, with thirsty towels and some basic amenities. I was on the 3rd floor, and the elevators are a fair distance from the lobby - not a big deal but worth noting. Location is on Forest Lane, just off Josey Lane, just south of I-635; about 15-20 minutes from the DFW airport. There is nothing special about this hotel - good or bad. It's your typical, traditional Courtyard style hotel, and if you want something clean, comfortable, and simple, you'll get it here. Hotel often goes on sale for weekend stays - enter code ""MEB"" when doing a search on marriott.com (this code is for weekend specials), and see if this hotel appears, before booking at a higher rate. I paid $44/night, which made it an excellent deal for the price - not much higher than Motel 6, but far better. The only issue I ran into is the water pressure in the shower - and this has been noted in other reviews. The hotel appears to use water-conserving shower heads, and while it's nice that they think ""green,"", it would be even nicer to get a nice, powerful rush of water when stepping into the shower in the morning. The water pressure isn't bad, but it could be better. Bottom line -- decent hotel, especially at special weekend rates. But not exceptional. Chose this hotel for one night in Dallas. Upside: Price was right. Alfredo, the night clerk was extremely helpful, as was Jesus for breakfast in the morning. Room was clean. Downside: No water pressure in the shower. Only got good water pressure when we turned the water to the full on position which was very hot. In-room, complimentary internet access was non-existant. At least we couldn't access the net and there were no instructions in the room. Since we're not techies, we did without. We asked for a room on the first floor. Although the place was almost empty, they gave us a room facing out, rather than into the courtyard. Very disappointed in this since our room had a patio door leading onto the parking lot. I would expect that unless requested, or unless the hotel was full, they'd assign inward facing first floor rooms FIRST. Then fill in with outward facing rooms as needed. As otheres have said about this hotel, either the televisions or the beds are in the wrong place. You need to lay on your side to watch from bed. All in all, it's an okay place, and we'd probably stay there again, but will shop around before staying again.

TOOK A ROADTRIP WITH A FRIEND AND THEY BOOKED OUR ROOM HERE AND I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED. Our room was very clean and we had a neat little balcony that was really cool. The staff was nice and very helpful to us we needed directions to a restaurant, the clerk did a mapquest and printed out directions for us with no problems. Whirlpool was very nice and we also went for a swim in the pool. NEXT TIME IM IN DALLAS THIS IS WHERE I WILL BE STAYING 10-4! Great hotel for a relaxing few nights away from everything.. Nice, courteous, respectful staff. Clean, quiet.. I enjoyed my stay here a few weeks ago. NO BUGS, NO MOLD SMELL as some one was referring to.. Overall this hotel is my favorite. I stayed at the Courtyard LBJ and found one of the best hotel is Texas. It was very clean, and hotel service was the best around. The manager even took time to visit our table during breakfast to make sure eveything was great with our stay. My family took a weekend trip to Dallas and absolutely loved this hotel. It was clean, inexpensive, rooms were big, and hotel service was GREAT. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, I was very pleased at how roomy it was even compared to some of the more expensive 4/5 star hotels my family has stayed at. We were stuck overnight at DFW and decided to make the best of it so booked a room here at the last minute with an online web site. For the rate we were paying, I didn't expect much, and the hotel far, far exceeded the expectations. I felt as if we should have paid more money. The pool was lovely, as was the hot tub. It even has a well-equipped exercise room. It is close to the Dallas north tollway, so it was really easy to get into the middle of Dallas (about 15 min. drive). If you need to stay in the Dallas area, and don't mind driving some, you won't have any complaints at this hotel. We stayed over the weekend while visiting family in the area for $59 including the breakfast buffet. The area is not the greatest along the interstate, but we were aware of this and didn't plan to be in/out late at night, etc. The room was very clean, the staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet (we paid $59 instead of $49 for it to be included) was great....eggs, meat, French toast, fresh fruit...what you would expect from a Marriott. Small, but nice pool area with room balconies overlooking courtyard (could probably get loud inside rooms if there was a crowd.) We will return. I only stayed here one night and thought it was fine -- the staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was spacious. (I only found out later that it was in a bad part of town.) The bed was OK but the pillows were very uncomfortable. Would I stay there again? For the hotel, I might, but considering the neighborhood, I would really think about other options.",,,
Citizen_of_Amherst,268206,"I was looking for a safe, affordable, and nice hotel near the French Quarter and I found it in the Whitney Wyndam. My room was lovely and clean. The bed was very comfortable. My only complaint is that the housekeeper did not replace the hotel-provided toiletries when they ran out. But the people at the front desk made up for that by sending more than I needed to my room when I requested replacements. The hotel, a lovely Beaux-Arts building and former bank, is located a couple of blocks from Canal St. I was in New Orleans to attend a conference on Royal St., just four or five blocks away. The location of the hotel was conveniently located near the French Quarter, the casino, and the French Market. The people at the front desk were very helpful in providing me with maps, suggestions for restaurants, and with helping me to find a shared taxi to return to the airport. I felt safe, especially as a female traveling alone, at this hotel. I would definitely stay here when traveling on business to New Orleans again. The lobby and the facade of this hotel don't look bad at all, but our room was grim. It reminded me of the dorm room at my under-funded state university. Yet at least the sheets on the bed in my dorm room actually fit and the comforter or duvet was not designed for a much smaller bed. For that matter, the dorm room's heat source did not blow hot air on my head as I slept. The heater in my room at this hotel was right by the bed. I wouldn't say that my hotel room was dirty, but the furniture was cheap and old, and the bathroom was shabby. I just love stepping into a shower and placing my feet on some grungy non-slip matting. The shower curtain rings were too small for the rod, so I couldn't actually close the curtain. The depressing yellow walls throughout the room were banged up as well. I like old hotels. I get that the rooms might be small and the bathrooms quirky. I've stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, which is also an older hotel. Yet my room at the Park Plaza was a palace compared to this depressing little hole. We couldn't wait to leave and noticed that no one at the front desk asked us if we had enjoyed our stay. Why ask a question when you already know the answer? We recently stayed here during a professional conference. The location of the hotel is wonderful. The view from our room was amazing. I found the staff helpful. The woman who cleaned our room every day was an exceptionally nice and accommodating person. The problem? Our room was so dry that I woke up practically every half hour in desperate need of water. We set the room temperature to 55 degrees, but it was still stuffy and pretty warm. I know hotels tend to have stale air, but this was the worst I had every experienced. Cacti would thrive in this room. In short, I got very little sleep over the course of our three-night stay.","Cannot complain at the price offered through Travel Zoo. We arrived to discover an enormous generator running full throttle outside. Unfortunately the hotel had received a power cut a few days prior which had yet to be fixed. Our room was on the top floor above the generator, so not much sleep for us, after walking all over Boston that day. An older hotel with charm and friendly staff, and an overpowering smell of cleaning fragrance in the entry foyer. Our bed was very firm to sleep on along with the pillows. No give or take there. We overslept, so ate breakfast around the corner at Dunkin' Donuts. The lobby and the facade of this hotel don't look bad at all, but our room was grim.

Why ask a question when you already know the answer? I've been staying here for over 10 yrs, I also used to work here, ha! It doesn't look that much has changed, it needs some paint and new furniture and a tile scrub in the showers but you can't be the price. If you're not a princess, ha, I recommend it! My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights, and chose it for its central location. We used the T to get there from the airport. Only 5 minute walk to Green Line! Dunkin Donuts around the corner. Breakfast was pretty decent: cereal, toast, bagels, pastries, muffins, tea, coffee, juice and fruit. The hotel itself is old though. They've tried updating furniture to make it newer. When we walked it, the lobby has an old musty smell. I consider these small incidentals though, because we wanted an affordable and clean room in the city center and thats what we got. Front desk staff were really nice. Complimentary internet access in the business center, with printing. We would stay again even though its not a top notch hotel. My wife and I spent a night at this hotel this weekend for $69 , after getting a deal from Travel Zoo.com. We were pleasantly surprised at the room size , bigger than the room we stayed in on the previous night at the Omni Parker House. The Checkout time was noon and they let us store our bags for as long as wwe wanted while we walked around the city. Great place, the complimentry breakfast kept us going till lunch :-) We wer eheaded to Boston for a conference that was being held at the Westin. The special room rate was $309 a night!! Across the street is this little old historic hotel. We got a room with 2 full sized beds for $139/night!! We walked to the conference every day and saved almost $200/night!! It is not new but it is clean. It looks like the last renovation was in the 70's or so. The bathrooms are brown porcelain tile, TV's are tube TV's etc. The lobby is gorgeous and the breakfast/coffee in the morning was served on a nice sun room built out form the hotel. This hotel is right near the orange and green lines, a short walk to Roylston Street shopping and you can literally see Copley Square from the front door. Its an incredibly low price for its location and the beds were comfortable, the water was hot and the elevators worked. We were happy and had a lot more to spend while we were in Boston.",,,

Great location, close to everything Friendly staff Comfortable bed, great shower, modern, roomy, clean rooms","Great location, close to everything Friendly staff Comfortable bed, great shower, modern, roomy, clean rooms The hotel is located about 40 mins walking from Taksim Square and only 5 mins from OSmanbey Metro Station which is one stop from Taksim Square . Mac & BERGER KING are less than one min walk ,also Cafe Nero and Starbucks. the staff are very friendly and helpful . the room is big and comfortable . the price is not logic for this hotel . We stayed there in October with our baby, and we were very much satisfied. The main reason was the amazing hotel manager Serpil Hanim. She made sure that everything was perfect for us. She even watched our son while we were having breakfast! The rest of the stuff was very friendly and professional as well. Location is great, rooms are nice and clean, breakfast is very good. We are definitely coming back! I cannot say just how surprised we were to find this hidden gem of a hotel. Centrally located and close to osmanbey tube stop, this really is a great modern boutique hotel. It's safe to say that it doesn't exactly have appeal from the outside, lodged between a wig shop and a nail salon, but get up to the very contemporary rooms, and find that, contrary to most hotels in Istanbul, they really have made them modern, well tiled, and I would safely say they surpass 4 star chain hotel standard. Excellent shower, drench style, massive comfy bed, and a good, if expensive minibar. The area around the hotel is within a short stroll of the tube, and of an extremely up market shopping district. Also, a ten to 15 minute walk will get you taksim, central. By some distance though, the best thing about this hotel is the level of service, the desk always offering taxis, transfers and advice. For example, We arrived after breakfast had finished on our first day and were brought fruit, cake and tea, all free of charge. We felt very welcomed. Very rare you receive this kind of service in a major city. Book this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",,,
Carrie B,230902,"Our family stayed at Turtle Bay last August. Two kids, one couple and one super-fun Grandpa. We had an ocean-view suite that had 2 bedrooms, one sitting room/kitchen area and 2 baths. I honestly am counting the days until we can go back. The weather is glorious (a little sunny, a little cloudy...perfect) and my kids got to take free scuba lessons, surfing... The best part about Turtle Bay, at least in August, is that there aren't a lot of people there! We dined at the restaurants around the resort with no reservations, no dress-code... We just wandered in and ate fabulous fresh seafood with great service and had no worries. It is truly the perfect North Shore atmosphere. If you're interested in big beaches with tons of people and a wild nightlife, Turtle Bay is not for you. If you're interested in lovely surroundings with a completely laid-back attitude and absolutely fabulous service...look no further. I have stayed on the ""strip"" many times and wanted to try staying Downtown. The Golden Nugget is a great place to stay! Everything you need wrapped up into a small , fun package! For me the ""strip"" is way to fancy, I dont want Louis Vuitton shoes I just want a cold beer, some entertainment and a place to celebrate with my friends! Freemont St. is the place for that! I highly recommend the Nugget, beautiful place, old school style! Stayed here for two nights on our first trip to Amsterdam. Hotel is very close to the Apollolann Tram stop (use the 24) and the staff was extremely helpful for us firs timers. Our room was very spacious and overlooked a courtyard area on the backside of the hotel. It was great to wake up in the morning hearing the birds singing. (We didn't hear any noises from other guests) The breakfast wasn't as extensive as some hotels offer, but was still good. The beds weren't in the best shape, but the rest of our room/bathroom seemed freshly renovated. They provide free wireless and it works very well (unlike some other hotels where it is spotty). Can't say enough about the staff and location. As a group of women traveling, we liked the fact that the hotel was in a quieter part of the city, yet only a 15 minute Tram ride to the Red Light District and Central Station. We just stayed at the Comfort Suites for 5 nights and it was perfect! After reading the reviews, I had mixed emotions on my choice but Im glad we chose this hotel. The hotel is tucked back of the main road so dont think that you have made a wrong turn some where. Our room was plenty big enough for all six of us with the young ones sleeping on the pull~out couch. The room was clean and had a huge bathroom but we were in a handicapped room. The breakfast was great, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravey, cereals, fruit, fresh made waffels...something to please everyone! I dont know what people are expecting but if that isnt enough there are plenty of resturants to get breakfast in walking distance. Pool was open 24 hrs which was great since we got back to the hotel late eveyday. Over all it was a great hotel. For those looking for a 5 star luxurious hotel, this is not it! For those who want a nice, clean , easy access hotel for a reasonable price than this is it! We were really happy with the Golden Nugget. I was worried after reading some of the reviews. We have never stayed downtown, so we didn't know what to expect. We stayed in the Carson Tower rooms and they were great. We spent about 5-6 hours in them to sleep, so I couldn't justify paying for an upgrade. Our room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. I thought the walk wasn't bad at all to the casinos, people make it sound like it's five miles or something. We looked at it as extra calorie burn after eating nothing but garbage all day :) We had no trouble at check-in either. Will I stay downtown next time, I doubt it. I'm glad we did it once though...I truly believe I have just about seen it all now. I have stayed on the ""strip"" many times and wanted to try staying Downtown.

The hotel lmis located in a increadible convinence, close to the airport as it is to the downtown. But the Beds are in rough shape. The breakfast is very good and the people is very friendly. For a one night stay before flight is good. I stayed here with my 13 year old daughter for 3 nights from 12-15 April. I got a very good deal via Otel.com & breakfast was included. After reading some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive but I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was really easy to find, I found if we caught the 24 tram this was quicker and took about 15-20 mins from the centre. It was very close to shops restaurants and museums. Our room was excellent and huge, the beds were comfy and we had a brand new bathroom everything was very, very clean. The only gripe I have is the pillow was not good but I think that is a continental thing!!! The breakfast room was lovely, ok so there was no bacon and eggs but I knew this anyway as I know they don't eat this in Holland. Coffee was good and hot and there was a great coffee machine. All in all I cannot fault my stay here and would book here almost certainly again. This hotel offer a good standard. It is poor in some details but in Amsterdam can be considered a good compromise beteween price and service. Breakfast is extremely poor. Rooms are not well isolated (you can hear guests snoring... imagine if more happens!) It is in a calm residential areas with several restaurant. Close to the teathers and Museum area (Museaum's square). It is very well connected with center and train station on one side and WTC, Hospital, Free University on the other, using few trams like n5 and n.24. It is very close to South-Station, closer to Schipol airport. I think it is a good choice. We stayed here from Oct 6-9 of this year and thought it was a nice hotel for the price. It is your typical European room, not as large as we are perhaps used to in North America, but certainly big enough for our needs. The bathroom was very clean and obviously newly renovated, and the room was very clean as well. We always used the stairs (except for luggage in and out), so the complaints by some about the elevator didn't apply to us. The breakfast was adequate for our needs and staff were very helpful, though sometimes a bit hard to find... We absolutely loved the location - it was out of the city centre on a very quiet street so we always had a good night's sleep. It was just steps from the tram, which was very convenient, and only about 10-15 minutes from downtown attractions. Positives: quiet location, 15 min nice walk to RAI conference center, people at the front desk are nice coffee and tea in lobby at any time and you can get wine, coca etc- if you ask for it- at any time Negatives: Haha, this is NOT a 4 star hotel ! Minimal customer care - seems to be the management style from the above One bathroom smelled really badly - refused Rooms are cold, because the heating panels have air inside AND they do not turn the heat on (it is under 10 C outside) - even after we have asked for it... There is no thermostat in the room ! Bathroom is tiny, beds are not comfortable with tough blankets and pillows. I would avoid this place again, although I am not that picky. I just expect hotel to be a clean, pleasant, reasonably warm place to spend a night on a conference trip. :( I stayed here for a week. This is NOT a 4 star hotel. The property is poorly maintained, bathrooms are filled with mildew, the bed linens and sheets smell unpleasant and dont seem clean, carpet in the room is full of stains, a bulb did not work in the room and they didnt fix it until the night before I left. The only good thing I can say about the hotel was that there was a good free breakfast that came with my booking. The staff was friendly but like I said, they didnt fix the bulb in the room until the night before I left. The neighborhood, location and breakfast are the only good things about this hotel. I would never stay at this hotel again. For the price I paid, I could have stayed somewhere much much better. Room was spacious enough but telly was rubbish, bar was the same price as any city bar but without a doubt you could find cheaper Typical price was 5 Euro / pint. Breakfast again was nothing to write about- just the usual ham & cheese! It is situated near to the tram line for dam square & central station, take the number 24 or number 5. Trams where 2.60 Euros = 1 hours travel. Hotel in general was average with no real nasty points. We stayed here for two nights 16/17 September. Room was clean but no tea or coffee making facilities in room. Curtains had a huge gap and spent two nights with a shaft of light in my eyes! Staff were very uncooperative and no bar as the only member of staff was on the desk. As we were a party of 37 this was very poor. Knowing well in advance that the hotel would be full they should have put on more staff o cope with demand at breakfast - one two slice toaster for 37 people is not enough. Many rooms had no working phones, hairdryers, lights and certainly no internet (even though it was advertised). I would not stay here again. This hotel is a pure gem. Designed by a famous local architect, previously a private residence. Quaint enough to be a B & B, but offering great amenities. Great value, great rooms, great staff, did I say great? The Delphi is a little off the beaten path, but in a wonderful neighborhood of in-town chateaus (The Pijp), very convenient to the tram service (50 yards from hotel), but a wonderful walk to Museumplien and Leidseplien. Great restaurants just around the corner. A very clean and quiet neighborhood. The free breakfast was not a full service affair, but much more than just a continental breakfast. Free internet that worked great. The staff is freindly and accomodating. I'd stay here anytime! If you are looking for a good quality hotel away from the noise of the city this is a good option. The hotel had a tram line 1 min walk from the front door and you can get into the city center very easily this way. The room was comfortable and clean and a good size. The staff we met were very welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was plentiful and adequate and the coffee ok! It is also close to the museum area and opera house. All in all a good stay and gives you a chance to see a very upmarket part of the city nearby with plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants within a few minutes walk. Great hotel, located just a short walk from the museum qtr, with a tram stop a stones throw from the hotel. Every night we got a perfect nights sleep in spacious room, nothing fancy but ideal for city break, would def recommend it. Amsterdam is a great place to visit for any age, with something for everyone, loved it! My husband and I visited Amsterdam last month to embark on a wonderful Northern European cruise. We only had one day in Amsterdam before boarding our cruise but we had the time of our lives!!! Our plane landed in Amsterdam early in the morning, and we were extremely happy when we arrived at this lovely hotel just after 9:00 AM and we were told that our room was ready for check in. We were also offered to help ourselves to breakfast which was free of charge and the food was very satisfying, The entire staff were very friendly, our room was very comfortable and we were able to catch some ZZZ's before we ventured out into this amazing city. After a full day of sightseeing we returned to the hotel to find a nice local restaurant for dinner. We were advised to try a nearby Italian restaurant named BaronyÃ¢â¬â¢s and we were not disappointed. My husband had the best lasagne he has ever tasted! and this restaurant was also very reasonably priced. Our night ended with a couple of glasses of wine at the Delphi which included conversation of the friendly hotel staff. I have the fondest memories of this hotel and Amsterdam in general. I hope to have an opportunity to visit again someday! Enjoyed the very nice neighborhood that this quaint and quiet hotel is located in, excellent service, good breakfast, rooms are dated with no A/C in ours, but we enjoyed the staff who went above and beyond assisting us at every turn! I felt I did a lot of research before we made our reservation, and after staying at the Hilton down the road previous to the Delphi, for the rate it was money well spent!",,,

I guess it's all down to expectations and uses - *all* I expect from a hotel is a good night's sleep, without smells or noises. I don't care that much for room size, or even window view. OK, make it clean, this is important, but other than that, I'm all right. I'm there to sleep, and anything else I do elsewhere (which is why I can't comment on food, for instance - I always eat dinner out, and almost always breakfast, since I have only met very few hotel breakfasts I could like.) In this particular case, whether I was lucky or whether all rooms are the same, I can't say - but I think I got much more than what I paid for. The room was spacious, clean, the bed comfortable, and the view... well it was great. I could see the TV tower and the rest of the city. So, yes - the staff weren't the friendliest, nor the most efficient. And as with most Ibis there's only a ridiculous little PC with web access in the hall, for which you tend to have to wait for. But the location was truly wonderful - not ten minutes' walk from Alexanderplatz, and going the other way there were lots of very nice places to eat, drink, have coffee. For that money, those low-brow chain hotels make up in value what they, undoubtedly, so severely lack in charm (and boy, do they lack charm :)) I'd stay there again. I only stayed there two short nights, and in a single room, which was on the small side - but what I look for in a hotel is a comfortable and quiet sleep, and this I got in abundance. The room was charming, and overlooking the quiet and nice garden at the back (I have no idea how quiet the rooms at the front are however.) The location is, I think, quite good for a city the size of Berlin. Very close to the main train station, and I walked to the center very easily. I really enjoyed the place, and would definitely stay again.","This gem has a rich history that hearkens back to the older days of a divided Berlin. It was a real discovery for us, and ""Honeymoom"" hotel lived up to its name. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the companion hotel's restaurant and discovered how wonderful dining with the locals can really be. We enjoyed very comfortable accomodations, comparable to the luxury feel of a Westin, found our way around the safe and well-lit residential neighborhood nearby without any trouble, and enjoyed the close proximity to the U-bahn and S-bahn routes. Hotel reception was absolutely charming, and made us feel like old friends returning after a long time away. It was only a ten minute walk to the colorful pedestrian zone and a memorable stroll down Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate, and we engaged a knowledgeable guide to show us the historical sights and memorials throughout the eastern sector on our second day. Perfect location for a visit to Berlin, especially if you plan to see much of the old East Berlin historical sights, the Stassi prison site, the majestic parliament (Reichstag),and stroll through the Tiergarten. This is a very special place. We had an apartment in the garden, which was very nice. There were steep starirs to climb, but this had been announced by the hotel on beforehand when making the reservation, so that was our own choice. We definitely liked its location: quiet and still close to the lively places. Very much the feeling of a living neigbourhood in the former East Berlin. And of course the garden is magnificent. Also very pleasant are the homely breakfast and breakfast room(s). You have definitely not the feeling of staying in a big hotel. Stayed here for 4 nights for the Berlin Marathon. The hotel is a nice mix of antique and modern, and the location is great. They have a secure parking facility, and the U-bahn and S-bahn train stations are a block away. S-bahn from here take about 10 minutes to get to Unter der Linden, Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, and the main downtown shopping district. If you want to go across town to Charlottenburg, the Zoo, etc. it takes about another 20 minutes with train changes. It is also only a ten minute walk from Museum Island, as well as 2 streets (Tor strasse and ??) that were full of restaurants and bars that stayed open with great nightlife until dawn. My husband and I stayed for three nights in September 2010. The gentleman at the front desk was great helping us navigate the city by public transportation. Our room was small but nice - a little out of the way - but we didn't mind and welcomed the exercise by walking. This hotel is a little farther out of the ""main"" area of Berlin, but is a pleasant walk into the main tourist attractions. It's clean, the staff are friendly and happy to help. The one issue we had was no AC. They provided us with a fan - but had to use the one they had set up in the main lobby! The garden in the back is beautiful - perfect place to have breakfast and start the day. They also have a computer in the lobby for free internet. I highly recommend this hotel. We recently stayed for 7 nights, having booked 2 suites and a single room. The rooms were clean and somewhat quirky, as previously described. The garden was a real treat, a lovely place to relax and enjoy the daily included breakfasts. The desk service was, however, minimal and begrudging at best. Requests for information or help with dinner reservations etc. were met with abruptness or incomprehension. The phone itself in the room had to be rented (although once rented there was no charge for local calls). The suites were located on the 3rd and 4th floor (actually the 4th and 5th) with no one to help us up with our bags. Although there was a coffee machine on the ground floor that was always available, there was a charge to make a cup of coffee or tea, symptomatic of a lack of graciousness or the lack of providing any extra comforts to guests. All in all, none of us would stay there again. I only stayed there two short nights, and in a single room, which was on the small side - but what I look for in a hotel is a comfortable and quiet sleep, and this I got in abundance.

tsushima,91599,"I think my expectations were a bit too high for this place. The staff had that ""meh"" attitude- except for Jerry the bellhop (he was super awesome). And they nickeled and dime the hell out of you, the plaster in our room was cracking, we can listen to our neighbor's TV, and the food was over priced and bland. I will admit that the bed was comfy and the gym was well maintained. All in all, it wasn't worth staying for four nights when you can get a great room with better service down the Strip.

Freeways connect you to downtown from all directions- extend your search and drive a bit further if you have to Had a 3 night stay. On the first morning, had no hot water at 6:30am (Friday morning). After contacting the front desk, had hot water by 8am. On second morning, had no water pressure and little hot water. Problem never resolved the entire morning. Breakfast is very good. Good selection. Very few personal items available in their in-house ""convenience store"" (I had forgotten my toothbrush). Had to go to convenience store next door for personal care items. We were very pleased with every aspect of this hotel. The staff were exceptional, everything was very clean, the pool was perfect, the breakfast was a very nice presentation. Granted, I stay here on business and I have stayed here a lot but I would consider this particular hotel and other Residence Inns for potential vacation stays. My room has always been very clean. The bed comfortable. The staff always friendly and accomodating. I appreciate the galley kitchen although I use it rarely. Compared to breakfast at other hotels, the Residence offers a wider selection of hot entrees plus your standard fare. One suggestion, try to hit breakfast early while the scrambled eggs are creamy and not dried out. We stayed here for two nights while in Indianapolis to visit family. The room was very reasonable - $89 plus tax - for a Residence Inn. It was a standard Residence Inn updated perhaps in the past 3 years, and near to the new airport. Clean. Room was typical studio with sitting area and small kitchen. We were in a building separate from the main building which meant we had to walk across the parking lot to go to breakfast - would not have been good in serious winter weather. Breakfast was standard fare but seemed to go fast. We had some road/traffic noise that we could hear from our room. Overall, everyting was fine but nothing outstanding or exceptional during our stay. This hotel was one disappointment after another, especially considering it is part of the Marriott chain of hotels. I am a seasoned business traveller, and have stayed in hotels all over the world. I usually look forward to staying in a Marriott chain hotel because of the reliability of quality. This particular hotel was a total diappointment. The hotel is situated at the intersection of a highway (I-70) and a major roadway. The Indianapolis airport is adjacent to the hotel and guests of the hotel can hear planes all night long, in addition to the traffic on the neighboring highway/ roadway. The surrounding neighborhood is not nice, to say the least, which lead to me (a female traveller), not feeling comfortable leaving the hotel after dark. Loud, ""souped up"" cars were going up and down the main road (Lyndhurst) all night long. To summarize the negative aspects I experienced during my 6-day stay at the hotel: no hot water for a shower on morning number 1 (which also happened to 3 other co-workers I was travelling with), a very noisy room on night one, after which I requested to be moved (after a series of miscommunications with the front desk staff, to include giving me a key to a new room in which another guest was already checked in), I was moved to a somewhat quieter room. In the new room, the dishwasher was broken, as was the latch door lock, the shower curtain, and the coffee maker (which overflowed during brewing). In addition, the hotel rooms are not laid out like typical Residence inn's, with two separate rooms. Rooms at this hotel are not divided, and the hotel actually consists of two separate buildings- separated by a parking lot, which further aggrevated safety concerns for me personnally. The hot food at breakfast was continuously running out and the property seemed, overall, to be older and not well maintained. This was a major disappointment for a Marriott stay. On a positive note: breakfast staff was very friendly, as was the evening ""happy hour"" staff, which served guests willingly and went above and beyond. After staying in a Residence Inn the night before in Syracuse NY, I found this location lacking. I travel with pets and have no issue with non-refundable pet fees in order to be able to stay in a nice, clean, room. This room was gross. The hallway outside smelled of dog pee. My dogs were all over the room sniffing at the carpet, and found something interesting, dried dog poop droplets, embedded in the carpet. They weren't large, but still....nasty Then I found dog poop behind the bedroom door. Socks under the bed, lipstick on the glasses, all in all an experience I don't want to relive. i notified the evening desk clerk about my dissatisfaction, she apologized. In retrospect, I wish I would've asked for another room, but having driven 12 hours I was a little brain dead and just wanted to go to sleep. I told her I didn't mind the dog fee, but expected a clean room. I also complained at check out, and she expressed concern, stating she would speak with the manager and to expect that my pet fee would be refunded. I appreciate that greatly, but would have been happier paying the $100 and getting a room that wasn't nasty. I called the manager this morning, and she was very responsive. She had already refunded my $100, and had spoken with the contractor they use to sanitize the room., so while my experience wasn't good, I will say that the manager's response was terrific. She appreciated the comments and said that they become a better hotel by guests letting them know when they fall short. That's the right answer! For that reason alone I will check the ""recommend"" box. Check in went smoothly. We stayed at other Residence Inn's and nothing compared to this. The furniture was old, not comfortable. Room had a strange odor. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. If you go for one night, it's ok, but longer than that, think twice.",,,
crazycabobob,283241,"Travel light you cannot drive to the hotel because it is located in a no vehicle area. Steep stairs to rooms, be careful. Hotel was under construction ( right under our room). We tried to deal with the noise but it got the best of us so we requested another room. They upgraded us to a VERY nice suite at the back of the hotel but they had to shut the water off for most of the day ( every day). Stayed another day and coudn't deal with it anymore. The hotel gave us a FULL refund when we decided to move to a new location. This was my second stay and If you are a people watcher and like the nightlife and being ONE block from the beach then this is a great place for you to stay. Been to playa four times (so far) . This trip we were forced out of our regular place because of construction and found this place walking back to get our car. Great value for a place on the beach not to mention free parking and 24/7 security. Good food, drinks, pool, and Steve's dive/snorkle shop just next door. Rooms are very clean and the maids leave you a new towel animal every day. The A/C works VERY well (not noisy) and lots of hot water when it gets to your shower. Can be a little loud at night because of the local clubs but WILL BE BACK!!!","The doors have very bad locks, the room smells funny, the music is VERY loud during the nights, the warm water runs out in the mornings, la chica in the reception told us to visit a doctor that costs 70 USD just for visit when a near by doctor on av. Juarez costs 70 pesos (luckily we found it before paying the 70 USD!), there's not enough security lockers for all guests, cleaning lady didn't clean every day, the airconditioner didn't work properly - it was cold and then hot. Good things: location. Looks nice from the outside. Must have been a very nice place before the mould and discos. We booked this hotel mainly because of its location, right on the beach. I regret so much not having read these reviews, we would have saved money and time, and a good night sleep... First of all, i have to admit the guy in the lobby was friendly but our dissapointment began when we opened the door to an awfully musty smell, as if the rooms were not open in months to let air in... the lamp between the beds was burnt and almost breaking into pieces, the bathroom looked clean but really primitive. We hadnt spent 5 minutes in that room when we asked for another one.. oh man! The second bedroom itself was not that bad, but the bathroom... the light and bathroom fixtures: Non existent, the toilet hadnt been cleaned in days, the shower floor and walls hadnt been brushed between mosaics so you could actually see the mold growing up there. This bedroom hadnt been dusted in days! It was late so we decided to stay just for the night... and then the fun part begun.. this hotel is located near one of the loudest corners in Playa so you can imagine how well we rested that night... The next morning we talked to one of the managers and showed her the awful conditions of the bedrooms, she was understanding but never offered any kind of apology not even the refund (or the solution to get one..) when we said we were leaving, after that we saw 2 cleaning ladies dusting and brushing the room but it was TOO LATE!. We had booked another hotel... Seriously, this is not the place to stay if you are looking for cleanliness and peaceful nights. This hotel is ONLY for those who like to party all night and sleep during the day. It is such a waste because the location itself is good and it does look good from the outside. Been to playa four times (so far) . This trip we were forced out of our regular place because of construction and found this place walking back to get our car.

Only tip that I do not recall from other reviews is that room key must be inserted in wall box to make lights in room work. Great for energy savings! We chose the hotel to be near friends. Our small 6th floor double room (definitely the servants floor when the hotel was built in the 19th century) had everything we needed and the shower room was spacious and well supplied with nice fluffy towels and toiletries. The refurbishment completed last year has been well done and the place feels fresh. This place seems good for business and pleasure - especially shopping. Although it is on a busy street and our room was on the front at the top, we were not troubled by either street or a/c noise. The staff were professsional and very helpful and the location is excellent The only down side was an unexpected meanness in the supply of teabags (just one each of ordinary and mint tea) - a contrast with the 2 shampoos and 2 shoe cleaners in the bathroom. When we asked for one additional bag - we were told that was not possible - by staff who were clearly embarrassed! We suggest people who want to drink tea in their room here bring their own teabags - a small price to pay for an otherwise very decent place. We would happily return to the Atlantic I have stayed here over the years and it keeps getting better. They continually upgrade the rooms and the location and price can't be matched. 5 minute walk to major shopping and nearby to several Metro stops. Breakfast was very good. You will not find better value in the 100Euro range!!! It was easy to get in and out of the Atlantic Hotel; the night guy (Joe, or Joachim) was awesomely helpful in everything from booking shuttles to getting the use of the microwave for baby bottles; the rooms were impeccable and the bathrooms were beautiful. I had a very nice stay and would definitely recommend it. We were there with a group and our baby only woke up others once. The walls are not thick enough for a really screamy baby, though. A few minor drawbacks: only a bath, no shower; the baby crib was somehow broken in the bottom which meant she was sleeping on a slant; it's close to the train but far from the RER; there is no restaurant, only breakfast; the day staff were pretty cold; the breakfast was pretty unhealthy; the room itself was not huge and the only clock was embedded into the TV (pretty small). Altogether, I had a great time and would definitely stay again. The proximity to Gare St. Lazare made it very easy to use the trains in and out of metro Paris.",,,
Lana M,242986,"We stayed at the Gretna for a weekend and were very pleased. As it is off of Hwy 76, we avoided the terrible traffic. We were able to walk from our room to just about everything. The pool was a god-send as it was terribly hot-we spend a good part of the day there, then went out in the evening. Our room was spacious and the air conditioning nearly froze us on low!! The large TV was super for watching the olympics and the microwave and refrigerator allowed us to stay in when we wanted to. Breakfast was great-coffee & donuts were really good & fresh. The manager was EXTREMELY friendly, welcoming and helpful. The price was really low for Branson during the tourist season. We have a new place to stay when we go to Branson-the Gretna! This Inn is awesome!! We went in the off season, got our pick of rooms, a great rate and a super pool & spa. The rooms really were the best we've had anywhere. The pillow top beds and extra fluffy pillows, along with super quiet h-a/c units helped me sleep better than I had in weeks. We had a pleasant swim and a super relaxing soak in the best hot tub I've been in since my own. A wonderful continental breakfast-the biscuits & gravy were as good as I serve at my cafe. We have found a new ""favorite place"" in Branson and not only will we be back, but have flyers in our store in Cape Fair to give to travelers on thier way to Branson. We look forward to the next time! We went B&B to hotel, breakfast was great, rooms were very good and all amenities very good. Very handy to all bus and train routes","We went B&B to hotel, breakfast was great, rooms were very good and all amenities very good. Very handy to all bus and train routes Where to start; worst problem is probably that the company advertises with it's central location and even mentions on Expedia that it's located in the Mitte district... Don't be fooled, it's not. It's a 15 minute walk to nowhere, though at nowhere you at least find a subway station. Still, the neighborhood itself is amazingly uninteresting and appalling, ie ugly and at night full of drunks on streetcorners. Next up, the horrible, ill-making smell which for some reason comes from every possible bathroom in the hotel. It was explained as some summer-based problem with river water coming up (?!?); Still, summer was gone and the smell remained. Regardless, how could one accept any excuse?? Rooms only have double twins, which leaves me wondering: is there actually anyone aside from a bunch of students travelling together that rather sleep on a smallish twin bed?? Minibar is advertised as complimentary, though you are chargest for every refill (last time I checked, that was not the definition of free). Breakfast is so expensive, you might expect caviar and champagne. While the selection is definitely decent, it in no way compares to the outrageous prices. In general, food appears to come at a price which is quadruple it's value. Staff is mostly uncompetent, albeit somet are somewhat friendly. However, the front office manager is probably the most unfriendly, uninterested, arrogant, rude and uninterested person in the world. The kind of person that intends to make you feel sorry for any inquiry you might have dared to ask. Anything positive about this hotel? Well, the wellness center is ok, and they did make an effort to be trendy (endresult however, they failed somewhat). Well that, oh yeah, and they are right on the banks off the Spree, however if you are not a river fetishist, this will not make up for all the things it lacks. Stay away from this place! Stayed at the Adrema at the end of July 2011- the hotel is ok, staff are friendly however location is not ideal! The hotel itself was good, breakfast was nice and the restaurant served good food. The hotel was ok - reasonably clean, but not immaculate. The rooms were basic but served a purpose. I guess you get what you pay for and this place wasn't ridiculously expensive as we got a corporate rate through work. THe strangest thing i found was when I asked for a Iron in my room - they said they didnt have irons in rooms due to health and safety (ok that makes sense many hotels dont) but they had an iron and an ironing board that I could use that they kept behind reception?! I was like ok, interesting - i'm a business travller having to iron my crisp white shirts behind your front desk. This aside the staff were very warm, accomodating and helpful and the hotel itself was in a reasonable location (a bit further out from the centre, but not far from the main station). The hotel is really clean, nice, friendly staff and nicely situated next to Spree. However, like most German hotels they have religous propaganda on the rooms in the form of bibels. Also, their ISP does not support any roaming partners, and there are no nearby open wifis. We went to stay in Berlin and chose the Adrema because we got a good rate on night and reviews were good. The only the bad thing is it was a little bit far out but the train station is about a 5-10min walk. The rest was absolutely awesome, the rooms were really clean and spacious. The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel itself was clean and there were no faults. The breakfast was the best thing. I've stayed at a lot of 5 star resorts and 3 and 4 star hotels most the time when I have had breakfast its not quite there. But at the Hotel Adrema they hit the nail on the head. I cannot fault anything, Muesli, Fresh Fruit, Full English and also some hamburger things that were awesome. Cereals, Croissants and other pastries just was brilliant.",,,
jon g,111538,"when we got in it was late at night, our room had a small tub and had a view of the roof. I coplained the next morning because it was nothing like the big jet tub we saw on line, so they switched me to the 21st floor with a great strip view. We really enjoyed the tub, there is a bath soap store in mandalay bay shops that have great bubble bath bombs. We never had time to visit much of the hotel or its bufett. The lobby and casino is smoky, we went to the circque show the O, and the phatom of the opera. Ate at delmonicos and le cirque and le fluer. Pretty nice place to stay for the money.

I did not use any of the fitness or spa facilities other than the walking trails, which were very peaceful and inviting. The room was large, clean, and very quiet (I did not hear any noise at all). The staff was unfailingly polite and helpful. The only negative was that the decor of the room looked like it was straight out of the 1980's (wallpaper, furniture, bath fixtures, etc). The room was also very dark, so I needed to turn on lights even during the day. If the Cooper Lodge updates their rooms, this could really become a fabulous destination.

Having a five star fitness center as part of the complex was a really nice benefit. And I can't say enough about the hospitality of the staff. As we arrived in the evening, I had no idea how beautiful the grounds of the lodge were. The walking/running trails are so nice in going back and forth between the nice oak trees and around the Cooper Clinic buildings. The tennis courts were full with smiling people playinig lively rounds of tennis. The fitness areas are state of the art and staffed by friendly and helpful staff. There were several outdoor pools which appeared to be heated as it was November and they were full of swimmers doing laps. As we were upgraded to a suite, we had a large bedroom, large bathroom as well as a living room, dining table and bar area. We enjoyed the extra space but the allure of this hotel is the surroundings. The location is great, just off 635 and near many good restaurants such as Mercury as well as the Galleria.",,,

My daughter and I headed to the beach on a last minute fun day before back to school. The hotel was very nice, newly painted rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. I was disappointed in the BATHROOM... really outdated and the tub/shower was NASTY. The faucet and shower head were hanging by a thread, lot's of calk holding it on and zero water pressure. And I was surprised not to find a hairdryer :( Parking was not so fun, but we found a spot. I might go back in a pinch... but It won't be my first choice.

The shared bathroom was always very clean, I just returned from a 4 day stay at the Atlantic Oceanfront Inn, and I was extremely satisfied! You can't beat the incredible views from the ocean front units. The rooms were very clean, and the staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and very professional! You can't beat the location, it's far enough away from the boardwalk that it's a very family friendly safe feeling hotel, but it's close enough that everything you want or need is within a few minute drive! They even have free beach chair rentals so you don't have to pack your own! My daughter and I took advantage of the pool just about every day we were there. We'd spend mornings on the beach, go site seeing in the afternoons, and then head to the pool in the evenings. I will definitely return to Atlantic Oceanfront Inn for our family vacation in OC MD next year! When we went there, the swimming pool was closed for maintenance. Top floor another issue. Rooms were ok but far too small for the price. On the other hand, the hotel was very convenient in terms of location. This place was great. They worked really hard to help me find my wallet when I lost it (after houeskeeping helped us tear the room apart, a staffer found it in the lobby and called us right away!), the pool was well-maintained and clean, the staff people were universally classy and nice (I especially liked the lady who maintained the continental breakfast) and it was just a good deal all aroudn!

Brilliant hotel. Good value for New York. Only complaint would be that the heating doesn't turn off so it can get very warm. Fantastic location near a subway. The shared bathroom was always very clean,","This place was great.

Room was on 2nd Floor (Stairs only) w/vaulted ceiling, very comfortable King size bed, great flat screen TV w/plenty (digital) channels, very quiet at night, only 15 minute drive to Strip. I liked the curved shower bar keeping curtain away from body, shower head had 10 spray options and very good water pressure. Clean room, plenty of parking; would definately return. Very good complementary breakfast. Hot tub in indoor pool area was out of commission. This hotel is a conversion from Holiday Inn Express on West Sahara. It was clean, well appointed, and the staff was professional and courteous. I have to return in May and have already made my reservation. I stay at hotels about 200 nights each year on business and find this property to be one of my favorites in Las Vegas. It's away from the casinos and there are great restaurants close. The breakfast is good too.",,,
Christopher P,224830,"Staff was terrible to deal with. There are much better hotels in the area with a nicer staff than Harrah's that are more affordable! Hands down the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at in New Orleans. Do your homework and you can find much better. It's not the best hotel I've been to but there was nothing terrible about it. Clean, safe, easy to get to and priced right. I'd stay again for sure. I had a pleasant stay at Main Street Station. I did not rent a car so I cannot comment on parking, charges, etc for that. I also did not gamble at the casino (although I am a craps enthusiast, and with 20x odds it took quite some self-discipline to stay away from the tables). The buffet is excellent!! I only went to the breakfast buffet, which at the time of this writing is $7 per person and has all the variety that you would expect from a Vegas casino. Weekend mornings are a little more, $11 or $12 each with all you can drink champagne. Casino seemed a little less smoky than the golden nugget, four queens or binions. The craps tables still had positions open evening during weekend evening peak hours, though this could have simply been the result of the table going cold. The room is pretty good. I didn't spend that much time in the room. I got a room on the 11th floor on the freeway side so I got some freeway noise while trying to sleep, but this was nothing compared to the other type of noise while staying at the Flamingo a few days after I checked out here. I wanted to use the shuttle service offered, but I didn't know where Sam's town is and did not want to wait forever to get to the strip. I elected to buy a 24hr bus pass instead for $7. Elevator service is snap-quick. A relief if you've ever stayed at places like Bally's or Luxor or especially Imperial Palace (ugh).","This hotel looks like its need of a facelift, but its clean and we had great service. It's not the best hotel I've been to but there was nothing terrible about it. Clean, safe, easy to get to and priced right. I'd stay again for sure. Late at night when checked in ,no wake up calls, clock did'nt work. The worst was the trash and garbage piled up a foot tall behind the night stand. We would not stay for the second night. Complained and got my money back. Plus the road going back to hotel is very dark. Loved the two-rooom suite we had at this Extended Stay. Were there for two nights, having booked on-line (and after reading the T.A. reviews!). Have found that the extended stay places are just as economical as regular motels, but love the convienence of a kitchen. Room was clean, bathroom was very clean, and bed was comfortable. Only downside were the pillows - too small and soft for our liking. There is a Cracker Barrel restaurant right in front within walking distance - another perk we like when traveling! First timers, for even short stays, have to remember the way the extended stay places work - - - it's like your own apartment. YOU have to pick up after yourself each day. YOU have to either hang up your towels to dry (or go to the desk for new ones yourself). YOU have to make your own bed. YOU have to do your own dishes (they do offer dish soap). YOU have to provide your own shampoo. The cleaning folks will only come in once a week during your stay, or more often if you pay for it. We have come to really enjoy this kind of lodging - kind of nice to sometimes leave your shoes and socks where you dropped them the day before! (Kidding!) our stay at the extended stay was very enjoyable. we stay at motels at least 3 times a week all year and if i had my choice i would stay there all the time. I would definitely recommend this motels to others. My husband and I were relocating to Indianapolis from South Carolina. We found Extended Stay Deluxe close to a job I was being transferred to. Let me tell you, after the stress of moving and not wanting to impose on family I needed pampered. Well i got it at Extended Stay Deluxe. The staff on check in. The wonderful maid that comes and takes care of me to the coffee and breakfast. I do not think I will ever leave!",,,
Cestovatel_W,498904,"I liked this hotel. It's located outside the city centre and main attraction areas in a nice and quite residential area, to get to the city centre you need to take a tram (kinda expensive) and it takes 15 minutes. So if it's your first Amsterdam visit i would recommend to find smth more centrally located, otherwise a high hotel is good. Rooms are nice, cozy in dark traditional Dutch colours and well equipped. The bed was really comfortable for sleep. The breakfast was amazing and from huge windows you can see taking off and approaching Schiphol planes. All services 9restaurant, boat cruise, the internet) are unbelievable expensive, like 17 eur for 1 hour of slow wifi. Crazy. The hotel is located outside the city in-fact, just on the A-dam ring. If you are by car it's a great location (because you can park a car near the hotel for free at night, but hotel's parking costs 20 eur / hight or more, don't remember), but if you are without car it would be really comlicated to get to city center. A room was very basic, clean, but not cozy or really comfortable. Public areas and lobby are really impressive and modern, there is free internet in the lobby, but in room only with charge. Breakfast was pretty good. Hotelâs located 4 subway stations from Alexander Platz (the city center). Actually Itâs possible to get in the center by walking for 15 minutes. Subway stationâs located near the main entrance to the hotel. Room was simple-designed, but everything was ok â modern design and furniture. Standard double room didnât have a bath, only shower. The hotel is absolutely outside the city, close to IKEA and Ciampino airport. So if you don't have a car, don't stay there. If you have it, be ready to spend up to 1-2 hr getting the city centre (depends on the traffic, serious jams during morning and evening hours). The hotel itself is very basic, most of guests are huge tourists bus groups from the East. Rooms are basic as well, no even minibar (there is, but empty), but beds are very comfortable for sleeping. Breakfast could be fine, but it's not well maintained, so out's by chance, you could find good offering or you can come in wring moment and find nothing.","Nearby Local Supermarket at very good price, But No Free Wifi ><"" avg stay. Went with the tour. Very limited selection of the Brkfast This is a great hotel to stay at for any reason - business or personal. Rooms are a little basic but they're clean, comfortable and functional. Good TV and wifi is available in all rooms. Food is great (taste & value) and the chef is willing to discuss his cooking with you, if you're interested :-) The waiters and reception staff are always willing to assist and welcome you with a smile. This is an incredibly friendly hotel and great value, too. It is also close to the Anagnina shopping centre and has plenty of parking available. I have stayed here twice, each time for a week, and have thoroughly enjoyed both my visits. The hotel is absolutely outside the city, close to IKEA and Ciampino airport. So if you don't have a car, don't stay there. If you have it, be ready to spend up to 1-2 hr getting the city centre (depends on the traffic, serious jams during morning and evening hours).

Breakfast could be fine, but it's not well maintained, so out's by chance, you could find good offering or you can come in wring moment and find nothing. The hotel is new and is located in a shopping area. the rooms are nice and comfortable and the bathrooms are very clean. the biggest problem is the breakfast, there is variety of food but this is rarely replaced, so the guests have to wait for food. the bread and pastry are are not fresh (industrial anda packed) and the fruit is canned. The hotel is near the Anagnina metro station , but it is impossible to walk to the station because there is an freeay between the hotel and the sation. You have to take a bus. Metro takes about 20 minutes to central Rome. This is a good hotel if you want a hotel with an accessible price and if you do not mind being away from the city center. We stayed at this Hotel for just 2 nights and found it's location perfect for our needs. We wanted to be close to Anagnina Metro and Ciapino Airport following which we were driving down to Sorrento. The Hotel is a recent build integrated within a Retail Park facility. The Hotel facilities were modern, very clean, helpful staff, reliable shuttle to and from Anagnina Metro, breakfast was a buffet and well provided for with breads, cakes, fruit, cereal, cold meats and cheese. I think it's a great place to be if you just want a place to rest following a long day in Rome. It was very reasonable at Â£112 for 2 nights and as said, great for our needs but would not recommend for long stays and is clearly not within any walking distance of anything but the attached Retail Park. The hotel appears to be really new and the rooms and hallways look really nice and trendy. All the room doors on the hall side have an enlarged scene from a classic movie or a classic actor. The rooms are really spacious with tile flooring, making the place really look and feel clean. The bedding was a nice and comfortable queen bed. Although i did book a twin room for my sister and i, but we didn't bother changing rooms after we informed reception. Don't except any views or anything but this is to be expected for the affordable pricing of the hotel and the location of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of food including hot and cold food. The hotel is located in the Anagnina region which is about a 20 minute metro ride from Termini station. The downside is though that the metro is only running until 9pm and the public buses that go to the hotel (2min bus ride) don't run after 9pm or there abouts. The hotel does have it's own shuttle bus service, however the times are quite limited. I mention that the bus ride is a short 2 minutes from Anagnina metro station, sad thing is that you cannot walk from the metro as there is a highway in between and there is absolutely no way to get to the other side (i tried a couple of times). So if you arrive to Rome late at night there is a bus service from Termini that will take you to Anagnina and then you will need to take a taxi from there which will put you out of pocket by about 10euros. Hotel is also in close proximity to Ciampino airport and has a shuttle service there too. Staff at the hotel were nice and more often than not had a smile on their face. Would definitely recommend this hotel for people who wish to save some money and not stay in the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Our travel agency booked this hotel for our entire tour group, the hotel is relatively new ( renovated I believe because some room has updated modern bathroom layout while some have very old tiles and toilets). The hotel is packed with group tourist so check-in can be hectic. We checked-in on a Friday night and there was only a lady working out there alone around 8:30pm. The biggest problem is that the hotel is within a shopping mall complex, which is normally fine but on a Friday night, the parking lot turns into the illegal racing hotspot for all the pimped-out rides. We were first okay with it because the drivers and audiences were just doing their things without disturbing tourists. However, because the air conditioning dont work in our room we had to open the window which means we heard the tire-screeching sound for whole night. Luckily police came and the crowd dispersed, however they came back until someone got into accident. You can fulfill some shopping needs there, and there is a McDonald's around the corner open 24hrs. The hotel was difficult to find using public transport. The room was confortable and clean. Unfortunately the airconditioning was not working. The staff did try to get it going. There is no restaurant in the hotel or nearby. We had to eat in the IKEA cafe it was the only option if you did not want to go into the city centre. The worst aspect of our stay was the race track in the carpark outside racing cars at midnight and until 1.30 in the morning was unacceptable - we complained to the staff and they told us that the police had been called - the police did arrive but as soon as they left the racing and music started again. The race eventually broke up when there was a car crash - the police returned and at last we were able to get some sleep. The airport shuttle bus was on time and efficient.",,,
Patricia T,571673,"We started our four week trip to Canada and Alaska with a two night stopover at Sunset Inn and Suites arriving there after a 40 hour flight from Western Australia. An excellent place to catch up on sleep and adjust to time change. We found it to be extremely comfortable and convenient, within easy walking distance to Stanley Park and lovely walks along the foreshore and plenty of choice of resturants all around. Our only regret is that we had not allowed ourselves longer there. My four-night stay over the US Thanksgiving holiday couldn't have been lovelier at this friendly, smart, elegant, efficient hotel. The staff was delightful and on top of every detail, the room with a view of the city and the fantastic crystal addition to the ROM was immaculate and comfortable with great amenities, the location was perfect for the things I wanted to do and close to the subways for seeing other neighborhoods. I enjoyed every minute of my stay and I can't wait for an opportunity to return. We have been staying at the Tidelands on and off for at least 10 years, probably more. We have always enjoyed our stay. The rooms were always kept clean, perfect location. We loved sitting on the balcony listening to the Ocean and watching the people on the boardwalk. The hotel had also told us that they had completely remodeled. First nightmare, two weeks before we arrived a Hooters Restaurant opened right next door. The noise was unbelievable, even after they closed people moved outside and partied right in front of the place AND our hotel. Second, about the remodeling, hmmmm they should get their money back for the LITTLE that was done. The got new cabinets and ""granite"" counter tops, no way were the real granite. The furniture is just as I remembered it, may have been new comforters although mine had cigarette burns all through it. They also claimed to have re tiled the bathroom, once again if they did they need to get their money back, the tiles did not meet up very well and they didn't look any different than before, maybe they just replaced some bad ones. Things that were MOST difficult for me, other than no sleep, the drawer that they put in the kitchen area was not big enough to fit the silverware tray (??) so they laid it on the bottom of the cupboard under the sink, I have had recent surgery and can't bend so there was no way for me to get to these, an unexpected problem. Next they had safes installed in the rooms, nice idea, but once again putting them near the floor is not very accessible got me and I am sure many others. We have always recommended this hotel to all our family and friends but unless Hooters finds another home I would not recommend to this place to anyone but teenagers that want to party all night! Believe me, there were plenty. The front desk was very friendly and I realize there is nothing they can do about the problems that I encountered. I hope the management reads this and perhaps a couple of hotels could get together and get Hooters away from what used to be a relatively quiet area. So convenient to everything. I am deeply saddened by my visit this time. This was an ideal location. Short 2 blocks to the Quarter with enough of a buffer to be quiet at night. Wonderfully renovated hotel with a gorgeous lobby and a great lobby bar. King size bed room was very large and comfy. We were on club level and there were nice amenities involved Ian, Kendall and Marissa made the stay even better for us with their fantastic hospitality and personal attention. You have to have Ian make you a French 75. Best cocktail in the city! Wouldn't stay anywhere else in NOLA. Superb location for tourist spots,restaurants and easy walking to Grand Bazaar.Rooms are minimalist and the hotel's name takes a bit of practice (remember Butch as in Cassidy) but otherwise zero complaints.Above all the staff were genuinely friendly and extremely helpful.We returned for a second bite of this cherry at the end of our holiday.Go for it! Don't go there ever. They have roaches, no ventilation in the bathroom, no hot or cold water, no matching towels, noisy neighborhood, and the beach, what beach? Stay at a resort that is for tourists, like Embassy or Hilton.The breakfast is a joke, most hotels have a 5am to 10am breakfast with the works, but this place 8am to 10am and only 5 items to chose from. From the very first moment when we handed the keys to the Valet, front desk arriving to the room and the whole stay was just SO fabulous! Every single member of the staff called us by our names immediately after the check in. When we arrived to the room there was Lemonade and chocolate covered strawberries with a very sweet note welcoming us to the hotel. Unlike other hotels they were prompt to help and very sweet all the time! I could not be happier will go back for sure. This is an utterly charming hotel with class A service and a congenial and helpful staff. Stay here in New Orleans! It's off the beaten path enough to avoid drunken tourists on Bourbon Street, but easily within walking distance if you want to be one! My husband expected a musty churchy establishment, but he was pleasantly surprised to find this monestary fully modernized, almost to the point of sterility. It was very clean, the AC worked beautifully, and the elevator worked fine. No TV but who needs it. The reception was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a bit spartan: no fruit, eggs or meat. It is in the Dorsoduro district, a very short walk from the Grand Canal Accademia vaporetto boat stop and bridge, and the art gallery. It is also a few steps from several waterfront restaurants on the Canale della Giudecca. Just had a fabulous weekend at the pier one - The location is really something and the room was spotless with a water view of traffic up and down the harbour. We walked under the bridge and around to the quay. It was perfect. The service at the hotel was outstanding - reception quick and easy - the guys put the luggage into the car which gave us more time to soak up the break. Mooched around. Breakfast was hot and arrive on time which was a blessing as we had stuffed around and not made things easy. They rang first up to see what time we wanted to be feed. We'd overlooked that part of the menu They simply couldn't do enough to help out. Would certainly recommend to anyone going to Sydney for Business or Pleasure. And it didn't break the bank- LOL","Located in a monastery, but with little sign of monks, this place has an ambience closer to a a modern budget hotel. It offers comfortable no-frills accommodation (e.g. modern bathrooms but no TV or kettles in rooms), a good breakfast, and helpful reception staff. It's also very reasonably priced. The building itself has some interesting features, e.g. its modern spiral staircase. It is conveniently located close to the attractive Zattere waterfront and the Accademia bridge, in a pleasant artistic area only slightly off the main tourist trail.

It is in the Dorsoduro district, a very short walk from the Grand Canal Accademia vaporetto boat stop and bridge, and the art gallery. It is also a few steps from several waterfront restaurants on the Canale della Giudecca. Best location ever...minutes to either Accademia or Zattere vapporetto stops which together offer options to cover just about all major spots and sights. Good eateries nearby, including a branch of Pizzeria Oche and range of choices in Campo Santa Margherita and Barnabas. On the Zattere, several choices for leisurely coffee and ice cream (Da Nico) indulgences. Great for jogging and walking to take open, fresh air and views on the Giudecca. Rooms clean, staff very welcoming and helpful. Peaceful setting. I stayed here a few years back and have visited again since then. It deserves the high ratings others have given it. One travel tip- if you are travelling to and from it for the first time DON'T go to the Zattere vaporetto stop unless you are happy to carry your cases across the bridge- up and down with about 20 steps each side. Instead get the vaporetto up the Grand Canal and get off at Accademia. It is then a flat walk of about 3 minutes maximum with no steps. If you are here in high summer make sure you ask for an air conditioned room and that you have screened windows otherwise those Venetian mosquitos can drive you crazy. My wife and I stayed two nights in Venice at this cultural center which previously was used as an orphanage. It was clean, quiet and affordable. Breakfast was more than ample and tasty. Service at the front desk was pleasant and competent. This hotel is a very spacous hotel with large, clean rooms,modern bathrooms and shining floors and hallways. It is very peaceful and quiet ,a place you can meditate in. The staff is great and helpful and professional. The breakfast is more than adequate and tasteful; but most of all, it has the best location in Venice. Only a walking distance from Zattere or Accademia stops and quick to get off the vaporetto and walk to your hotel. The surrounding streets of the hotel is spacious and very safe and peaceful at night. If you are looking to have a good night sleep and yet be close to Piazza San Marco and all the other attractions, this is the hotel to stay at. I rate this hotel 5 star and yet affordable.",,,
Adam K,120330,"Spent three nights at Marriott Dadeland attending a meeting. Marriotts are generally solid hotels. The lobby and bar are fairly upscale so one would expect a room with a modern plush top hotel bed but this was not the case. The mattress was hard and I mentioned that to the management. Making up for this was an excellent pool area and gym. The front desk were extremely pleasant and one bought me a Cuban dish I was craving when the restaurant she directed me to did not serve that dish. That kind of service went way beyond expectation. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect hotel is a comfortable bed. No room service for luggage (it means you need to carry it yourself to the room), no complimentary items in the room, no safe in the room, terrible design of shower and toilet, expensive in house cafe and unfriendly staff ... I will never ever stay there again ... Arrived to the property expecting very little but was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the room. Mattress seems comfortable as well. As I have been away on business, I needed to do laundry and was directed by the front desk to the laundry room. I had added coins and detergent to a load and after adding $1.50 in quarters, the machine did not start. I looked behind the machine and it and all others were disconnected from power and water supply. There were no signs that said ""Out Of Order"". I went back to the front desk and complained. The individual went to the laundry room to check for himself and the reported to me exactly what i told him. He did not volunteer to refund my money. When I asked, he told me that I am going to need to take this up with the people that own the machines. There was no apology. It was I that suggested that a sign be placed on the machine so that no one else falls victim to this. I had called when I made the reservation to find out that they had laundry facilities knowing that I was going to need to launder clothes for the second half of my trip so this is a great disappointment. In the hotel business, clean rooms and comfortable beds will only get you so far. Service matters too.","Stayed here for 4 nights in connection to a wedding. The hotel is a quite typical conference hotel placed near the Dadeland Mall, and close to restaurants in a quite newly build district. Further the access from US1 and the Turnpike is very easy. Book this hotel for easy access to the Florida Keys or the Everglades, but not the beaches of Miami Beach. The reception staff was pleasant and professional and the valet service was quick. The rooms are of a good size, clean and with good beds. Nothing special in respect to decor. Free wifi is always a plus in my book. We are right in the middle of a 3 or 4 star rating, but with only 4 elevators the waiting time could be quite long, and at an ordinary rate I would only rate it a 3. Spent one night in the hotel recently. Service was super friendly and efficient. The room was clean except that the carpets were just nasty. I did not want to step on them. Free shuttle from the airport was good. Saved me $40.00. Spent three nights at Marriott Dadeland attending a meeting. Marriotts are generally solid hotels.

Had a great stay, room was spacious clean and comfortable with bright attractive decor and fab flat screen tv.Wifi in room.Gym was very good for a hotel and pool area was lovely although overlooked by office buildings.Close to mall/shops. I've stayed at this hotel at least ten times this year and a few times a year for the past 8 years or so. I love the proximitely to the mall and the expressway. As a business traveler it's very convenient in case of forgotten items. Not to mention the closest ""store"" to the enterance is the Cheese Cake Factory and you can't go wrong there. Back to the hotel, great facility for business or pleasure. Comfortable oversized rooms with beds and pillows that will keep you down for too many snooze sessions. I always feel like a welcomed guest at the front desk, very quick but still friendly and accomodating. I've never had an issue here with the internet connection as I have in other chains. I should mention also the pool deck on the 7th floor is a very nice outdoor space. The gym is also up here and provides a nice view of the pool while you're working out. we went to do some shopping and sightseeing in Miami, the hotel is very comfortable, walking distance to the dadeland mall, the room was renew, the bed and pillows were so good, breakfast is very good, people were friendly, if i come back again, certanly i will come back In walking distance to dadeland mall. Great location! Nice staff. Strange wood panelled lobby but comfortable rooms good breakfast on the second floor, adequate pool area and well equipped gym. Good location for Mall shopping Stayed here for 3 nights in september for a conference. The hotel rooms feel old, they need an update, the food for the conference was average. Staff was nice and friendly. The location is good if you want to shop at the nearby mall or use the commuter train to downtown Miami. Rooms a little dated ie. old style tv but more spacious than other Marriots that I have stayed in. Bathroom small. Bed good. This hotel is fine for business but I would not recommend for a vacation. Stayed here overnight on a business trip. The hotel is outdated, just like most full service Marriotts. The Courtyards, and other sub categories are actually nicer hotels. Bathrooms very small and again outdated. Bed standard. View was the best part of the place. If I have my say I'll stay somewhere else next time. I'd suggest the same to you. Front desk was helpful and pleasant! My husband and I went on a long weekend and we enjoyed the price and the hotel...the valet service was very nice. However, when we arrived in our room, there was a mini-bar that was sensored. We are not drinkers so we always bring our own water and soda. It was a little complicated to have them de-code our refrigerator so that we could put our own drinks in there, but they still charged us at check out, but we did dispute it and they were accomodating. The other thing that was a surprise was the cost of our daily internet usage (approximately $9.50 per day). Usually hotels provide free internet service. I guess I'm used to staying at other places where small incidentals are included. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and get away. Stayed for a night with a friend. The staff seemed unmotivated and like they'd want to get rid of us. The room was large and nice. This was a nice place to stay, the rooms were nice and clean, the flat panel tvs are great, service in the resturant and bar area was also very friendly. Shopping is nearby along with some great resturants. The only thing I did not like about this hotel was the must valet park at $17 per day. Whilst the staff at this hotel are invariably charming the whole experience depends on which room you stay in. Quite frankly Marriott should be ashamed of themselves! The rooms on the lower floors have simply not been redecorated or refurbed since at a rough guess the 1980's. They very much remind me of the 'norm' for a large scale corporate chain hotel in the late 80's/early' 90's. Drab burgundies/blankets/bed covers/ill-fitting curtains - you know the type! The majority of hotels have moved on. There really is NO excuse here - I have stayed in much better motels. HOWEVER the refurbished rooms are comfortable, well-appointed and nicely decorated. Almost like two different hotels under one roof! We always stay at this hotel, by choice when we visit the Univ. of Miami. Great service, nice rooms, very comfortable beds. If you want to stay in very nice surroundings and just feel good- not going for the lesser bargain without the extra cushiness of the hotel, this is the place to stay. In other cities for quick travel we stay at the always dependable Marriott Courtyards- everywhere. But when in S. Miami- we enjoy ourselves here. And I am staying again next month. Right across from the grocery store, Dadeland Mall, and many restaurants and shops. And join the autoclub AAA for a few dollars- you get GREAT discount on most every hotel, rental cars and attractions. Can't beat it for the best price. I stayed at this hotel as it was convenient for the airport and business meeting but found it average compared to the normal standards of marriott hotels. The room was clean but i found the bed very unconfortable and thought the bathroom layout very akward with the toilet and shower inside but the sink outside of the bathroom... I would not return to the hotel. This hotel is great for visits to the University of Miami - so close by, and very luxurious. There is a rooftop pool that I find myself thinking about quite often! Walking distance to many different restaurants, a large mall, and the metro stop. Parking can be an issue since it is in tight quarters with condos and another Marriott (courtyard) across the street. Next to a grocery store as well. I have seen rates at $89.00 and go up to $350+...depends on what time of the school year it is!",,,
BrazilAca,259160,"Midtown is a very nice hotel for tourism. Well located, just a block from Taksim Square and Istiklal Street in Istanbul and at walking distance or short cab drive (10 to 25 min) to all main attractions. At Taksim Square you can also find the Metro station. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a modern hotel, fairly nice staff and a good restaurant, even though there are other good options at walking distance for lunch and/or dinner. However, be prepared, the rooms are small and tight, very European style! Overall a good indication for tourism in beautiful Istanbul, almost a Boutique Hotel. The Ritz Carlton hotel in Coconut Groove is fantastic for those seeking some peace and quiet in Miami! Very different form the hotels in Miami Beach! This is a traditional and sophisticated hotel. The rooms are very spacious, great bathrooms and balcony with great view. The pool is very nice. The staff is helpful and cordial. All that a great hotel should have. The only downside is the restaurant! They simply donÃ¢â¬â¢t have a good restaurant for guests that do not wish to leave the hotel. WellÃ¢â¬Â¦the location is perfect and youÃ¢â¬â¢re just a few minutes walking from the main street of Coconut Groove where youÃ¢â¬â¢ll find great restaurants with a great atmosphere! Eurostars Laientana Palace is extremely well located! This is definitely the plus of this 4 star hotel, near all major tourist locations in Barcelona. The rooms are nice and clean. The staff is mostly friendly. However the room service is poor and there is no restaurant. Very nice hotel! Great staff and fine service! Fine rooms, poor wi-fi, however a good hotel all over! Recommended! Habita is an extremely trendy boutique hotel! Great location, in Mexico DF fanciest street. Excellent bars and restaurants in walking distance. Great staff. The rooms are incredible, lounge music playing 24hs / day and very tasteful decoration. However this is a hotel for non-business travelers. It can be noisy at night and a terrible wi-fi connection. Nevertheless, a great hotel for nice day in the Mexican capital. The Conrad is a classical luxury hotel in Istanbul. Great hotel, with good restaurants, comfortable and modern rooms and a great staff. Nicely located at walking distance from the Bosphorus Strait. The high point is defiantly the bar at the 14th floor, a fantastic view of the city and the straight! DonÃ¢â¬â¢t miss it!","It was a good stay, but I am disapointed in the food served. Once I ordered fish which was very smelly and clearly not fresh and the day before all the food at the buffet looked really dried up (dry cucumber, anyone?). Then I ordered a club sandwich with chips... the sandwich was more or less OK, but the chips were just bad ; like potato strips soaked in fat, not ""French Fries""... The flyer in the room said breakfast served on weekdays at 6:00 and on sunday at 6:30 . On sunday when I wanted to take breakfast at 6:30, the flatscreen in the lobby tickertaped that breakfast was served at 7:00.... overall breakfast was OK.A nice hotel in a good location, but kitchen quality need improvement. Very nice hotel! Great staff and fine service! Fine rooms, poor wi-fi, however a good hotel all over! Recommended!",,,

Friendly and helpful service, good breakfast. This hotel just screams for a makeover like double glazed windows, modern bathrooms, good beds and interior decoration for the bedrooms. Other than that very good value! I did stay at La Reserve a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend, and we had a wonderful time over there. The room that we stayed in was very quiet and clean, apart from that the location was very good very close to centre of London and sights seeing. However If you dont expect a modern hotel probably you will have a great time over there like us. On arrival glass on main entrance was flithy and once checked in discovered our room to be smelly with tatty bed linen, one electricial socket to be working and a broken window. we were then moved to a bigger room but with similiar standards again one plug socket working no spoon to stir tea, cups were flithy and the general look was shabby,Breakfast consisted of stale crossiants and the whole look of the hotel is very very run down, In need of a MAJOR refurb...so we will not be returning. Stinks, Dirty, grubby, smelly, unfriendly, unprofessional, rude. Never again!!!! . The welcoming clean foyer of this hotel belies the appalling state of the rooms. The walls and doors along the corridors are grubby and desperate need of painting . The rooms themselves were not very clean and the beds were atrocious, I have never known a lumpier more uncomfortable bed and the alleged 'spacious bathrooms' as per their leaflet are tiny. There were long dark hairs clogging up the plug hole. Three redeeming features are 1. It's close to Fulham Broadway station ( District Line) 2. I was given a complimentary basket of surprisingly fresh fruit in the room. 3. Breakfast was above standard with plenty of choice and the staff allowed us to check in early and look after our luggage after we had checked out. However, I shall not be returning to this hotel. You get what you pay for. Fine hotel. Close to the underground where it is possible to run directly to Westminster (Big Ben, London Eye. Etc) The hotel has a prime location for Stamford Bridge (50m), 200m to the underground and a few 100 meters up to one of the most expensive streets in London (King's Road) where many celebrities come and open the windows of their new Ferrari, Porsche or a second car that bmw, audi and land rover. The area around the hotel, many restaurants, cafes, shops etc.. The staff is very sweet. They offered me to book a taxi to the airport if I had not mastered it. Breakfast is not fantastic. But dinner is fine. The hotel is not a 5 star, but if you just have to sleep there and walk in shower is perfectly fine. Hotel is situated next door to Chelsea Football club and we arrived at 2pm on a match day so the area was extremely busy as you would imagine! There were security staff on the front door of the hotel but we didn't see them again, so presumably that is just a match day precaution. Check-in was easy but I remember thinking the lounge looked shoddy, there was a stained settee in reception on our arrival, but that had gone some time later so probably was there awaiting removal. Our room was situated on the ground floor, just through from reception. It was small, and the furnishings were very shoddy and in need of up-grading. Rather disappointing compared to the web-site pictures. Beds were comfortable though and breakfast was nice, with a menu that would satisfy most people - continental and full English was available along with a vegetarian option. ( Vegetarian burger, not sausage - different!! ) We were going to Earl's Court and the hotel was close to Fulham Broadway tube station so was very convenient for travel. Our stay was for a weekend. Staff were pleasant enough and the hotel itself was adequate. I would stay there again, but would ensure I had looked at other choices in the vicinity first! They are rampant. Please don't stay here. They refuse to rectify the problem and the beds are so full of bugs, we had over 100 bites. And there is then the risk of bringing them home. The manager is fully aware of the issue but refuses to rid of the mattresses. Please pass this along! In the past 10 years I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The first time then hotel was a pleasant 3 star with friendly staff, satellite TV and ok decor. The second time the staff was less friendly, no more sat tv and a reduced breakfast quality, but the redeeming feature was the free parking and it was generally an ok place. Then I stayed there again last month - mainly because I needed the parking space - and it was BAD. We arrived on a day with a power cut and the staff saw us as an inconvenience and was generally quite unfriendly and could barely understand English. Our room wasn't hoovered due to the powercut and when asking if this would be done as soon as the power is back, we were told 'no tomorrow'. The room wasn't actually too bad and had been cleaned. The room ws small-ish with very worn furniture, but the linen was clean and the matrass looked ok to the eye too. The curtains and bed spread should have been washed a long time ago though. The TV was hardly watchable due to very bad reception. The bathroom tiles were cracked but all appeared cleaned. The first morning the breakfast was ok and rolls & croissants seemed fresh. The sencod morning the rolls & croissants tasted to be from the previous week. When checking out I complained as they were charging full price for an unhoovered room and the bad breakfast but the receptionist was very rude and made it sound as if it had been our fault. i woulnd't have minded all the negatives so much if the price had been beetter - we pais ÃÂ£85 per night for the room and the service and standart did absolutely not match the price. Stayed here in July and my wife got bitten all over by bed bugs. These rooms are NOT CLEAN. I found a couple of them and the linen full of blood. Friggin' things wouldn't even die when I popped them! So disgusting I was checking every bed in every hotel afterwards. Then the manager/owner tried to imply that we might have brought them! This was the first leg of our trip and we had just stepped off of business class...I don't think so. Wanted to wring his neck...but he didn't actually come out and say it. The breakfast was crap. Standard cereal and bread but everything a bit stale. I will not be returning to this hotel. We paid ÃÂ£89.00 per twin room which i would value at about ÃÂ£40. The car park is small with no bays so we had to park where we could and leave the keys for all 4 of our vehicles behind reception in case they needed to be moved. The beds were uncomfortable with springs sticking into you while sleeping, the pillows were lumpy and the linen didn't look the freshest. The showers have been set at Umpa Lumpa height so you bang your head on them and the room decor really needs attention. My worst complaint would be the staff when they could be found. They were very abrubt and rude,due to this we ate and drank elsewhere which resulted in them losing around ÃÂ£300 as thats what we spent in another venue. The breakfast was of continental style but you had to ask for toast and walk around the restaurant to look for sugar. my friend booked this hotel for 4 of us, after reading the reviews i was not looking forward to it,but i was pleasantly surprised,yes i agree the hotel is very dated and in need of decorating but the room was clean. the continental breakfast was excellent and the staff i spoke too very pleasant. Stayed at La Reserve last week end,had already booked when I looked on 'Tripadvisor' I read all the bad reviews,but thought I would take the chance, as most other hotels were booked out. Big mistake, we checked in on the Thursday evening, after a very slow check in,the key to my room could not be found,so the porter had to use the master key to let me into my room,the room was clean enough,but had a very strong smell of cigars, I closed the curtains but they would did not cover the window, as the room was at the front of hotel it was very noisy.plus at ground level people could see in. I went to meet my colleagues, and while I was sitting in the reception/TV area I sat counting all the ants that were coming and going in and out of the floor boards. Breakfast was a very dull afair, I went to make tea and the water was cold from the machine.The staff looked fed up and were in no way helpful. Who I thought was the manager never spoke or was in anyway pleasant. All in all it was a terrible place to stay. Never again! next time I will check Tripadvisor before I book. Do not book this hotel. It looks okay on the website but it's a different story inside. We booked it for a 5 night stay and on arrival the room we were given was an absolute disgrace, the door didn't close properly, the bathroom was filthy, the ""double bed"" was two twins pushed together which didnn't stay in place. When we complained we had to wait until the next day to be moved to a slightly cleaner bigger room, but not much of an improvement. The food was not good at all and the staff were very unhelpful.",,,

Rooms are quite small, but very clean. So perfect for people who just go to hotels for sleeping. Staff is very kind and helpful. We liked to walk to city from here and needed one complete hour. But if you prefer using subway, there is a station quite close. I recommend this hotel.

If itâs just a bed you want for a night then you could get much worse than this. I stayed at Citystay Hotel in August 2010. First of all, the neighborhood was one of immigrants (Indians especially). The receptionists were from Pakistan. They were very friendly and helpful, except the fact that we had to pay the whole amount of money before even seeing our room. The room was a bit small for a triple, we didn't have enough space for our luggage and stuff. The walls need repainting and the whole room needs some changes since there was water coming from the ceiling and lending on the floor. The bathroom was clean, but very very small. At the basement, the hotel has a kitchen and a dining room, where you can serve breakfast. They offer tea, coffee, cookies, milk and fruits for free. If you wish to eat something different for breakfast, you can buy from Tesco or another supermarket,. both situated very close to this hotel and put it into the fridge. The Bow Church metro and train station are very close to this hotel, as well as Bus Number 8 which leads to the center of London. My husband an myself booked to stay at this hotel.We are from Goa so were not very sure wht sort of hotel this would be. The entrance was not quite like a hotel as in Goa. But when we checked in we were glad we booked to stay in here. The room given to us was number 2 and was in the basement, i would say it was a clean n decent room just hoped the bed would b a bit bigger, the linen n the bath room were spotless.And since we were in the basement we had a easy excess to the kitchen n dinning area, the kitchen was well equipped and refrigerator was full too. I plan to vistit london back in nov and have already booked my room at the city stay hotel. They have also informed me that they are increasing the inventary of the rooms. The guys at the receptions were very helpful and friendly. I wish them all the best. Cu back in nov. I stayed at this hotel for four nights while visiting London. Although a bit far from the city center, the metro and bus stations were located conveniently close. The rooms are small, but clean, and the beds comfortable to sleep in. I liked the do-it-yourself style of breakfast. The kitchen is fully equipped and has lots of products to prepare a fast easy breakfast.",,,

When you walked in the corridor there was a big hole under the carpet. And its an axpensive hotel as well. DONT SELECT THIS HOTEL I've actually stayed here twice (some recommendation?), once with my girlfriend (who hated it and was depressed by it, but she has higher standards than I do) and once alone before catching an early flight from Gatwick airport. The hotel is cheap for the location (near Victoria Station) and I found the breakfast quite good for the price of the hotel. The rooms are small and rather 'worn' and the bathroom was shared and very small. But it is convenient for one or two nights and I would stay there again if needed (altho my girlfriend would not). The hotel was OK in terms of location, the rooms have seen better days and the staff was surly and unhelpful. Changed room 3 times before we were given an executive room (which we booked) that was big enough to swing my attache case. My partner and I locked ourselves out of our flat on a Sunday, so had to track down a hotel in our area during a very busy period. Despite checking with 10-12 hotels, this one was the only one with availability. So... now that you have the background...here are the pros and cons: PROS 1. Cheap - we paid 40 pounds for our room. 2. Location- next door to Victoria station, as the name suggests. 3. Free breakfast with the room - nothing fancy, eggs and cereal 4. Receptionist/owner- we found him very helpful CONS 1. Rooms - ours was tiny, and there were two double bed instead of one king. 2. No en suite bathroom. 3. General dilapidation of the place. Overall, this place is run down, small, rickety and true, on its last leg. However it should be said -- there were not bed bugs in our bed.For 40 pounds in London, we got a decent night's sleep but wouldn't want to stay here for more than 1-2 nights.",,,
bbono001,482635,"Close to the metro stop, otherwise its about a 20 minute walk to the University. Nice rooms, friendly staff (this was important because we tried extending our tour and needed their help with printing and timetables etc.). The only thing that was off was, as we checked in, the carpet outside our room in the lobby was covered in bed sheets... I think the maid staff had shampooed the carpet but who knows. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. We didn't get a chance to stay here as there was a horrible error with Orbitz (we'll never use them again) but the staff was very helpful in trying to contact Orbitz and working something out to find us another hotel near them. They didn't have to help us at all but they let us use their phone and helped up look up hotels and gave their personal reccomendation. They were honest about the other hotels and their locations and seemed like they genuinely cared about helping us find a place to stay. Many thanks to them and I can't wait to come back to Rome a 4th time and stay here. This would have been a great place to stay as its so close to all the sites... Our trip started off badly to begin with since Orbitz wouldn't fix a booking error between our original hotel. The staff was OK except for the Indian guy who worked the front desk; he was tremendously rude and made us feel like an inconvenience. The hotel is a dump, bad location from most of the major sites in the historical center. You have to ring the front desk just to get into the building, the elevator is ""shaky"" at best, and the computer in the hallway didn't even work. Not to mention the horrible smell from the restroom; the entire trip (5 nights) we were nauseated by the smell of sewer gas. We were forced to run the water all night just to be able to stay in the room. The hotel staff did not accomodate our needs and blamed it on the old building. The AC didn't work the whole trip and the TV wouldn't until the rude Indian guy finally came up to the room to troubleshoot the problem. The room did not have hangers to hang our clothes and the cleaning staff did not always bring fresh towels when they made up the room. This hotel is not worth the stay; its way too far from the main sites and its not worth the hassel. I love Rome and this was my 3rd time visiting... I'd just hope that if you are debating chosing this hotel you take this negative comments seriously when making your final decision. Very dissapointed with my stay here...","The hotel was hard to find, despite having the address written down, we were beginning to think we had been ripped off and that the hotel did not exist as there was no visible signage. Once we found the buzzer by the closed door we were directed to reception on the 2nd floor - we chose not to use the lift as it looked dangerous. We were disppointed to find the facilities in our room did not match those on the confirmation printout - we certainly DID NOT have the Alarm Clock, CD Player, DVD Player, Flat Screen TV, Slippers or MP3 Player listed. And our fridge was not working, and the shrug of the shoulders that we were given when we pointed this out did not stop our food going off. The staff ranged from good to useless, depending on who was on duty. The breakfast was the worst we came across in Italy, being a very limited choice and stale. The breakfast room itself was tiny, and sitting down and getting things to eat was an awkward exercise even if you could find an empty table. The luggage room did not exist - we left our bags in the corridor beside the reception desk, along with several other guests. We tried to use the PC in the lobby to check in onine for our return flight, but the internet would not connect - the staff member on duty was watching cricket on the hotel PC at the time, so this may have had something to do with it. Again the response was a shrug of the shoulders. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable we came across during our travel through Italy. On the plus side, our room was a good size, with large windows which opened onto the street below, and it was clean. The hotel was convenient for sightseeing, though it was a reasonable walk to The Vatican City, etc. But there was plenty to look at on the way. We stayed for three nights, which we had pre-paid, but would have rather paid a little more to get the facilities as advertised, and listed on our confirmation, somewhere else. This hotel wasn't within walking distance of any of the tourist attractions. The staff was terrible and even yelled at us for coming in too late. No one was available to help us lug our bags upstairs in the rickety elevator. The breakfast was weak and we even walked in to find no seats because the waitress what sitting down eating. The rooms were clean enough but the mattress was as hard as a rock. Definitely one of my least favorite hotels ever! Very enjoyable stay in this pleasant hotel. The staff were very friendly, fluent in English and very helpful. Breakfast was simple (croissants, breads, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, coffee/tea, juice) but completely sufficient to get one going. Interior (courtyard) room was very quiet, as long as you don't mind having nothing to look at. Great restaurants in easy walking distance, coffee shop / grocery across the street, metro stop 5 minute walk and Termini Station 10 mins away without luggage - or 8-10 Euro by taxi. The hotel is only marked by a small brass plaque at street level. Buzz the hotel at the street door or head inside if it's open, up to the second floor to find the reception. It also goes by the name ""Hotel Re"". Our trip started off badly to begin with since Orbitz wouldn't fix a booking error between our original hotel.

I stayed at the Coronation Hotel for 4 nights with my 7 year old daughter. After reading some of these reviews I must say I was a little edgey. My mind was soon put at rest . The room was spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. Yes the lift was an experience however we found it easy to operate and my duaghter could hold the door open, so I'm sure older people could survive. Our room was quiet and cleaned every day. There was no smoke smell. The location was a wonderful base for us. I think the negative reviews should not discourage anyone from staying here . You will NOT get better value for money or more friendly staff . We certainly will return . The NH Schiller is located in Rembrandtplein in Amsterdam. The square itself is a little loud and seems to cater to the club scene on the weekend, however it is the perfect location! Central to everything, surrounded by plenty of coffee shops, cafes and the tram line. You can literally walk to all the major attractions within 15 minutes. The hotel staff was very professional, friendly and fast. The rooms are decent sized, exceptionally clean and very comfy! I would absolutely stay here again! We did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel, but did try a few on the square and had great experiences. Walk down the canal about five minutes to the nieuwmarkt square if you are looking for a quieter, picteuresque dining spot. You won't be disappointed. Villa Nieuwmarket is a great place for after dinner drinks. Cozy and very warm feeling with fantastic staff.","I stayed at the Coronation Hotel for 4 nights with my 7 year old daughter.

We loved the location and proximity to all sydney has to offer...the hotel was great and the staff friendly. SydneyÃ¢â¬â¢s Hotel Coronation has so much potential. Perfectly located in the heart of the city within minutes of Town Hall station, a monorail station, dozens of eateries of all types and right next door to a Woolworths supermarket (more on that later). Priced below $120 a night, the rooms are small, but comfy with a tiny, but serviceable bathroom. But nightmares start late at night. Woolworths has a procession of semi-trailers unloading until long after midnight. Slamming the empty produce racks onto the tailgate makes a huge noise, but there are dozens of these trolleys to be loaded over a period of 3 hours. By 1230, theyÃ¢â¬â¢re normally finished. But it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t stop there. At 0515 clanging and thumping of beer kegs will break your dreams. A truck driver throws full, steel beer kegs onto the footpath, then slaps them on their side and down the cellar chute. There one of the hotel staff drags then across the concrete floor. The sound travels throughout the hotel. Trying to sleep above on the third floor it sounds like someone dragging concrete pot plants across the floor above. Next night? Same thing, with the hotel manager the culprit. Dragging the empty kegs at 0525 in preparation for the loading on the truck at 0623. Clanging kegs are thrown on back of the truck below the hotel windows. So if you enjoy your sleep, find another hotel. Did I mention the lift? It should be heritage listed. DonÃ¢â¬â¢t bother to go to Luna Park Ã¢â¬â get your thrills riding in the Coronation lift. The stupid thing is that all these problems can be easily fixed with double glazed windows, changing delivery times and a new, enlightened manager. Management seems focused on running a drinking establishment more than an accommodation hotel. Thankfully, the nice receptionist refunded the two extra nights and we moved out to a nice quiet hotel. The hotel is in a great spot right near Town Hall and we were happy with both of our rooms in every aspect but one. We stayed here prior to taking a cruise departing from Sydney but we will not be able to stay again for our next cruise and have booked elsewhere at the Metro in Pitt Street. Its a shame because the location and price were both right. I dont really understand how it happens but on the two nights that we stayed in this hotel, somehow despite the hotel itself being a non smoking hotel with non smoking rooms I gather, we experienced constant cigarette smoke all night. It was somehow getting into the rooms. My guess, and its only a guess is that because the pub section does not allow smoking inside, people step just outside the pub to smoke. There was a light smoke smell during the day when we saw a few people outside the door smoking but not too bad. However, I think that as the night goes on and the pub underneath fills up, more and more people are standing outside perhaps 10 or so at a time all smoking. This smoke then wafts up the stairwell which is adjacent and leads to the hotel acoomodation or somehow travels throughout the entire building through ductwork or channels that we did not bother to investigate. We just knew that unfortunately we could not stay again in future. I found it difficult to breath. Its a shame as I dont really have anything against smoking as such its just that I get sinus trouble if I am exposed to smoke. Anyway, if you are a smoker or dont mind the smell of smoke then this is a good option for a hotel but if you have sinus trouble then only stay as a last resort. I got the name of this hotel off an internet forum and decided to run along with it. The location was really fantastic. It was very easy to get there from the airport via the subway (remember to buy a MyMulti pass for your stay in Sydney). There is a Woolworths right next door with shopping malls, shopping streets, cinemas and many places to eat nearby. It did not really sink in until I went to stay in Bounce Hotel for the last two nights of my stay (wanted to check that place out). Admittedly the rooms are not of the best standards but for at the price point (AU$109/night) and the location, you really cant expect that much. The restroom/shower area was clean and adequate space-wise. The TV is small and slightly spoilt so unless you are planning to spend a lot of time in the room, that would not be much of an issue. Both of us slept very very well throughout the night even though the hotel was right smack in the city centre. The staff at the reception was excellent too. They were very helpful when we needed directions to places like Sydney Fish Market. I would definitely recommend this hotel to travellers who are on a budget and just require a place to have a good night's sleep. If you need to travel to other places, Town Hall station is just one stop away from Central station. All in all, great hotel! Hotel Coronation was a great place to stay if you want somewhere in the heart of the city and cheap. The staff were very friendly as well. We stayed at the Coronation the weekend of the City to Surf and we couldn't have asked for anything better. It was convenient in location. It was convenient with the shops it had surrounding it. And most importantly it was convenient on my purse. It was great to feel comfortable and at the same time be in the middle of the city. We stayed for just the one night before boarding the cruise ship Queen Mary 2. We really only needed somewhere central and a room to stay in, nothing fancy. We certainly didn't get fancy however we were amazed at the value! A very old establishment with good attempts at some refurbishment. A clean, tidy room that did have a smoked odour despite being a non-smoking room. A very small balcony that was rather bohemian but appreciated. A tiny, but quaint office with efficient staff and security. As mentioned by other reviewers, the lift should indeed be heritage listed (or something) we barely squeezed in with our luggage and the clanging and banging and barely closing doors created an experience in itself but definitly servicable! The hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything, buses, trains, eating. Absolute bang for our buck in this instance. I just had my first trip to sydney with my best friend. We stayed at Hotel Coronation because of its good reviews and we were not disappointed. When we read it was in a great location, they were right. it was super close to everything!! There's a bus stop just around the corner and the train station just metres away. If you rather walk, it is just 15 minutes to Darling Harbour and 30 minutes to the Rocks and the Opera House. You can find places to eat everywhere and a macdonalds just across the street. It was also convenient that there was a woolworths next door to pick up any last mintue items (you can also have internet access there too). In addition, I found the service was pretty good. Friendly and polite staff. The room I had was very clean. I didnt think there was much noise at night. The down side was that there was no hairdyer, some channels on the TV didnt work and that the elevator can be annoying as it was diffcult to open and close. But overall, it was a great hotel and I would stay there agian and I recommend it to everyone.",,,

We took advice of other travelers and requested a room on the 9th floor in a corner, no corners were available but the gal at the front desk found a suitable room instead. We ended up in a queen room which was very tiny, but it had everything we needed. The pillow menu was an added bonus!

We stayed in downtown hotel Seattle for two night. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms wee very clean. Just minutes away from union street and 5th avenue. Starucks coffee next door. 24 hour room service was extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered pizza to our hotel at 12am. we had a good experience. i made reservations and when i showed up, i quickly started laughing at how pathetic is was. first, they didnt even have parking near the hotel. second, i asked if they had wi-fi and they replied enthusiastically,"" we have it in the lobby!"" how is that even a perk? finally, i said screw this place for these rates and left. the manager offered other places and followed me to the door. the next day, they charged me for the reserved room and said that i was a no show! the people are rude and have not given my money back yet. they should post their business as a motel at the very least! all i can say is never again! This hotel is so bad it's a joke. I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables. The elevator crawls up squeeking the whole way with no certificate of inspection or weight limit posted. The room looks like somethig out of the 70s. Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading. Any positive reviews seem like ownership tring to do damage control on the reviews. My husband and I decided to stay at Hotel Seattle because of the price and the location. But in the end, it probably would have been cheaper for us to stay at one of the nicer hotels a block over. There's no parking at this hotel, which meant we had to spend 30 bucks at a parking garage. Also, there's no internet in the rooms and our T.V. didn't work. Definitely a BIG disappointment. I am just a college student visiting Seattle, and without looking into greater detail about the hotel I was making reservations with, I got stuck with Hotel Seattle. I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in. No human being deserves to stay in such a mold-infested dump. OH YEAH- pay $10 for wifi for one day. I was unfortunately booked into this dump by my corporate travel office, I have filed a human rights complaint. This place was probably a dump 20 years ago, its better days are long gone. DO NOT PAY TO STAY HERE, there are nice hotel in the area for comparable rates. We checked in, saw the room and checked back out. I can't add anymore to the description of the ugly, mold infested, creepy room than what has already been said from other reviewers. But I can tell you that it wasn't easy to find another hotel room on a Saturday afternoon. After calling nearly every hotel downton, we lucked out and wound up paying over $200 for the last room available at the Hampton Inn (which was beautiful). But I still shudder at the memory of my very short stay at the Hotel Seattle. I read the reviewsÃ¢â¬Â¦they weren't goodÃ¢â¬Â¦but I thought, well, its just a couple of nights and we will be out and about most of the day...what I didn't remember is this is the only place where we can go home and rest...and its not a place I would recommend to go and relax, it small, dingy, old and not conducive to relaxing. There are only two hard backed chairs in the room to sit on; otherwise there is only the bed. This hotel in general needs TLC. We observed unfinished repair projects which showed wires sticking out of the light indicator above elevator, unfinished ""window transom"" above lobby entrance, and lots of little things that wouldn't take much time to finish to give hotel a nicer appearance. Some things were just annoying like the only useful plug-in for an equally useless hairdryer (which you have to check out at the desk, I think they only have one) is on the FAR opposite wall from the mirror in the bathroom. The noise from the hallway sounds as if the people in the hall are in your room with you. It is enough to say the staff could give a rip!!! This attitude just trickles down from the manager so forget about appealing to someone higher up. All in all, not only would I not recommend this hotel for any kind of stay, I would picket it if I lived in Seattle to save people from checking in!!!",,,

Sara C,235884,"Had great helpful staff! They let us check in early and helped to make our wedding day and our honey moon weekend go very smoothly! Very appreciated for the helpful staff here! We have stayed at a number of palace resorts and are never surprised with the incredible service. At first I thought we were the only ones being treated so wonderfully but when you looked around every one was being treated like they were some super star! We just got back last night from a week at playacar palace and I totally missed Israel & Neftali first thing this morning! Israel was our server every morning for breakfast and was always waiting for us with a smile and my special green drink for me. I'm not a breakfast person but the chef Neftali made green chilaquiles that were to die for! He made them for me every day even though they were not part of what was being served....thank you Neftali! :) As for the service at the beach & the pool...all I can say it's how I picture the truly wealthy are treated on vacation. Perla always made sure we were taken care of and happy. While we were enjoying the sun, cooling off in the ocean or the pool, Perla was working her butt off in the heat giving every guest special attention. And when she finally had her one and only day off, Leonardo picked up where she left off giving us the same great service! And even when we were loud & obnoxious playing dominoes in the lobby bar Blanca treated us like we were one of the family!! You don't have to tip....YOU WILL WANT TO TIP!!! The hotel is strangely split into 2 buildings so if, like us, you are in the annex 2 doors down, you feel a bit detached from the hotel. The rooms are a good standard for the price and very clean. However, we asked for twin beds and were given 2 beds which were joined together so that we could not separate them and I therefore ended up on the couch! Breakfast was quite reasonable but no waiting staff present so impossible to ask for anything you needed. Our main gripe was the lack of hospitality - we arrived in Venice at 9pm and were checked in by the manager. The Hotel has a restaurant and we asked for a table but were told they were now closed. As many diners were still there and the advertised closing time is 9pm we were only minutes too late - I don't think this was a good start to our holiday! He could have offered at least something, and for this reason we did not return to eat there again. We stayed here for two days during the week this past December. The furnishings were very modern, and staff was extremely nice! The room was also modern, but very small. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but if you plan to be in the room a lot this may not be the hotel for you. We had breakfast at their restaurant which was great!","The hotel is strangely split into 2 buildings so if, like us, you are in the annex 2 doors down, you feel a bit detached from the hotel.

This hotel is in a lovely little canal off the Grand Canal just one stop across from St Marks Square and is a lovely quiet spot. Breakfast was good quality, the room was small but we were in the annexe but was clean and we were only in it to sleep as there was just too much to see and do around Venice. The restaurant also served lunch and dinner which was of a good standard. Would definately stay here again just for the location. We spent three days at the Messner during a really freezing cold few days, our room was always warm, clean and tidy,the only good points really. The breakfast room was cold in the mornings, one afternoon we asked for coffee which seemed to be a chore for the employee as she wanted us to wait while she finished her hoovering, no interest seemed to be shown towards the guests, a few times we walked through the reception and no-one even spoke to us, other times with Italian hotels we have found people to be friendly and interested in what was going on, on reflection we see why this hotel has only two stars. We stayed in room 1; the room to be avoided! it is right above reception, we heard everyone coming and going and from around 6.30am reception staff could be heard talking and banging around, all in all a big disappointment on previous Italian trips. Hotel Messner needs to up its game! Very good location for the price offered. Pleasant stuff, free WiFi access (unless stated 2E/hour). The walls design in the room is quite impressive and looks like stylish 19-th century one :) WiFi hardly accessible from corner room. No signs of the Hotel in the near streets, only one outside of the entrance on the building - the coordinates from booking.com were useful for our navigator. We found this hotel in our search for a last-minute room in Venice. The hotel is conveniently located five minutes walking from La Salute church, where there is also the boat stop. We arrived directly from the train station (line 1). We realized that there is a three stars hotel in the main building, while the cheaper rooms are located in a near structure. Room was ok, overlooking a garden. It was silent and extremely clean. Heating was ok as well. Bathroom was tiny, but water was hot and good towels were provided. We couldn't make the TV work though. Breakfast is served in the restaurant in the main building. There was a good selection of pastries, fruit, jogurt, teas etc.. The staff was kind and extremely helpful, we had an enjoable stay at Messner. I stayed at Hotel Messner for 4 night in early October 2011. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the room, which was on the 1st floor of their main buildings. The room overlooked the canal and had 3 windows with shutters and a small balcony facing the canal. The room was clean, neat, and well kept. The bathroom was small, but had everything in it. The restaurant was o.k., but sometimes when it was busy service was rather slow. The people at the reception were as helpful as they could be considering their limited English. The only thing I am not happy about is the inadequate response to my inquiries regarding items I accidently left in a drawer in the room. I inquired twice by phone and on the receptionist's suggestion send the hotel one inquiry by e-mail. However, a week after my initial inquiry, I still have not been able to find out whether my property was found. Just stayed at the Hotel Messner for 10 days and found it delightful. I had a beautiful corner room overlooking the Rio Fornace and looked forward to 'coming home' at night. The staff was very accomodating, helpful, kind, and friendly--they never turned down any of my requests for assistance, and in fact, went out of their way to be of service. The location is great, just behind Salute and across the Grand Canal from San Marco. I would happily send any of my friends there. The room was $160 a night and was not worth it except for the location. The room was infested with mosquitos and was not clean. The bathroom was tiny, and had to ask for towels. The room was also dark and dreary in the annex. The main problem with the hotel was the staff. They were unfriendly and went out of there way to be rude/sarcastic. The location was good because it was in walking distance to a local market and restaurants. Don't waste your money at this hotel. Great location close to Salute vaporetto stop and therefore St Marks. Very welcoming and helpful manager and public areas OK for this grade of hotel. I've read elsewhere that the rooms in the main building are fine but we were given a room in the annex which was grim and should be avoided at almost any price.",,,
abg112070,239073,"great staff ... everyone we met during our stay were warm, friendly and helpful ... always cheerful and smiling ... the rooms were basic but we were out most of the time and needed the room to sleep and have a shower ... our request prior to checking-in were dealt with ... excellent location the best asset of the hotel is it's location ... very near a metro station and is walking distance to practicallly everything ... the room we got was of good size BUT the toilet smelt disgusting (drainage?) ... when we mentioned this at the reception, they came ready with an air freshener and some alcohol based liquid which they used - it made us think that this is an ongoing problem that has not been dealt with ...

The room is basic (but we only used the room to sleep and have a shower). We requested a room facing the main street (gran via) but was warned beforehand that it could get noisy at night (we wanted the view more than the noise). They do have rooms towards the back which i assume would be quieter). The staff are all friendly and speak english. I would go back and stay in this hostal again.","The accommodation was cheap and if that is the criterion this hostel can be a choice. The room they gave us was facing the Gran Via. The views are good but the noise of traffic is all night. They had inner rooms but smaller. As our room was not great I am in doubt if the inner rooms will be good option. The air conditioning in our room did not work. As if by chance we do not need it, do not question the reception, but then checked the hotel website they charge as optional air conditioning (5 â¬ per night and room). For me is something that I will not choose this hotel again.The bathroom was small, with half bath, and no offering (gel, shampoo, etc. ..). Cleaning is on the threshold of acceptability. Could be better. The room was one floor above the reception which we had to access by stairs. The elevator only goes up to the level of reception. Although a metro station is a 50 meters, the station ""Calhau"" is not a main station and therefore implies that almost always have to make the transfer station of the ""Poerta del Sol"" or in the ""Gran Via"". The ""Poerta del Sol"" Station is 250 meters on foot. The area is a expensive area to take breakfast, for example. In the area ""Poerta del Sol"" there are several cafes offer breakfast at prices much more cheap. In this same building there are other hostais so if IÂ´ll choose this type of accommodation again IÂ´ll probably try one of the others. the best asset of the hotel is it's location ... very near a metro station and is walking distance to practicallly everything ... the room we got was of good size BUT the toilet smelt disgusting (drainage?) ... when we mentioned this at the reception, they came ready with an air freshener and some alcohol based liquid which they used - it made us think that this is an ongoing problem that has not been dealt with ...

Phil L,246379,"The Hotel was comfortable, clean, and reasonably priced, and the breakfast buffet was significant. It is right off the metro, and a short walk to Las Ramblas and the harbor. It's perfect for getting anywhere in Barcelona. There are plenty of places to eat in the immediate vicinity. The Cavalieri was a perfect little place to stay in Rome. Just two blocks from the Colosseum, the Roman Ruins, the Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill, and an easy walk to the Ancient Center. A metro stop is located at the Colosseum to get to places north as well as to the Vatican. The hotel is very clean and located in a quiet neighborhood. The staff was very friendly and the front desk easily managed special requests (extra blankets/taxi to the airport). You can't beat the value while in Rome. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, an assortment of fruits and pastries, yogurt, coffee, juice and tea. There is also a roof top deck where you can enjoy a bottle of wine in the evening, but considering the hotel is nestled in the middle of a block, the view from the roof is limited.","The Cavalieri was a perfect little place to stay in Rome.

However there are a few very good restaurants right around the corner from the hotel that made the stay a little bit special. I would definitely stay here again. As being 10th time visitor in Rome, we changed hotel. Hotel Cavalieri is recommendable, quiet surroundings, helpful staff and good rooms. The hotel is situated close to Coloseum and only a short walk from the tourist sites. We stayed for a wekend in this hotel and had a very good time. The room was small, but all you need is a bed and a bathroom, really. Both were there. Own balcony was a nice addition, but I think not all rooms have them. It is situated in a small street at 75 metres from the Forum, which makes this a perfect place to explore the Eternal City from. Breakfast was good with a wide range of cereals, bread, eggs, fruit, etc to choose from every morning. The staff are very helpful and will give you a some nice ideas for visits or trips in the city. the only drawback was an airconditioning unit outside, making it necessary to keep the window closed at night. This might be annoying in the warmer months. This is a great place to stay! This was my second time in Rome and location of this hotel was absolutely great. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and big. Definitely recommend staying here and will stay here myself for my next trip. My fiance and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. It is in a great location if you're looking to explore Ancient Rome, which we were. The Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, Trevi Fountain etc., are within a reasonable walking distance. The Vatican was a bit of a trek (we took the bus), but even that was okay. The room was nice, and had a large bathroom. It is in a quiet area, which is great for sleeping. Two of the best features of the hotel are the adjustable air conditioning and satellite television. It was great for us Canadians to be able to get in out of the heat, and relax after a long day with some English language television, LOL. There is a great breakfast served each morning (croissants, yogurts, muffins, coffee etc.). Not what we're used to in North America, but still tasty. Finally, and most importantly to me, the staff was absolutely lovely. We had forgotten to print out our Internet-purchased Colosseum tickets, and the front desk staff let me use their computer and printer to get them. Such an understanding bunch! Everyone was all smiles and ready to help you as best they could. Thank you so much to the Hotel Fori Imperiali Cavalieri for a wonderful stay! :o) Nancy and Jason We stayed at this lovely hotel for 4 days. The location is excellent, very close to Colloseum and Colleseo metro station. The room was small, but clean and serviced every day. Breakfast more than ample, but the tables are very small and space is a problem, Paolo at Reception desk is a superstar and without his excellent knowledge we would have been lost more than once. If you are looking for affordable, clean hotel this is it. Just got back from a 4 night stay - what a holiday!! The hotel is small, clean and friendly. Breakfast buffet is good - lovely coffee and very smiley Waiter - excellent value. Towels changed every day, beds every other day - more like a 4* than a 3. The rooms and bathroom are small but well equipped and extremely clean. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Location: Excellent - 5 min stroll from the Coliseum - at the city centre side, off a main street and extremely quiet at night. Would definitely visit again. Brilliant Hotel - Fabulous City. I can totally recommend this hotel. It proved to be perfect for a short break in Rome for seeing all the major sights. Its location is ideal; in walking distance of pretty much everything, even the Vatican if you are fit. The attitude of the staff is marvellous and the room was high quality and very quiet, which was welcome as walking around Rome is very tiring. We were particularly impressed with the receptionist who helped us with taxis and made us a cup of tea for nothing late at night â very much appreciated. At 130 Euros per night it was competitive for Rome, and we had a very large room for a Rome hotel (302 - I believe it was actually a quad room). The breakfast was excellent and large enough to keep you going until lunchtime. The nearby restaurants (Iaro and La Piazzeta) looked scruffy and touristy, but served great food. The latter stocks a really top quality Pinot Grigio at 20 Euros. The rooms have aircon and hotel has a roof terrace (though it was raining the night we went up there). If I return to Rome the Hotel Fori Imperiali Cavalieri would certainly be my first choice. One tip on the local restaurants by the way: those recommended on Trip Advisor were all booked up when we visited. You need to reserve in advance if you want to visit the top places. From our experience I would say you donât need to: Italians simply donât serve bad food, so it doesnât matter so much where you go. This hotel is in a quite side street yet very close to the forum and colosseum. The rooms were small but very clean and cool due to good air conditioning. The staff were friendly, especially the nice man who does breakfast and made me a great espresso each morning. They have a nice roof top terrace where you can take a bottle from the local shop and enjoy an evening drink. While we were there most nights we were the only ones to take advantage of this and we sat and watch a light show on the side of the colosseum, well most of one as you can't see the whole colosseum from here, but it was a nice way to end an evening. Our family of four, including two teenagers, stayed here for one night in August. As other reviewers have noted, the quad room is small - there is a queen bed in the center of the room with a twin bed a foot away on each side, There is no chair, table or desk. The bathroom is small. The shower is the size of a cruise ship shower and might be problematic for someone older or heavier. However, although the room might have been a bit small for our family for a week, it worked very well for us for one night. It probably would also work out well for a longer stay by a family with small children. The hotel was clean and very quiet. I am a light sleeper, but I slept very well. Breakfast was good. A few of the pastries were packaged, but most were good and there was a large selection of food. The coffee was very good. The best part was the location - near a metro stop, the Roman ruins and many, many cafes. I recommend arriving at the Coliseum early in the morning before the crowds and tour groups arrive, so having a hotel just a few blocks away is a big plus. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here if I were on a trip by myself or with one other person. The hotel is in an amazing location with the Colosseum just a few minutes walk away! We had a lovely clean room with a balcony, and the breakfast was good. My husband and I spent the last two nights of our vacation in the hotel. The location is wonderful. We especially liked how quiet the hotel was -- only a few steps away from a busy and crowded area, but we were able to sleep well! Hotel staff were not overtly friendly, but when approached, were extremely helpful. Our room, though small, was ample, and the bathroom was very nice. My only complaint is that I could not get cell phone reception in the room, but that's minor. And, the price (a spring deal) was good, especially for Rome. We were staying at the Hotel Nerva (see my review) but when the volcanic ash cloud extended our stay for 4 extra nights they wanted to put the rate up 30%. I searched on venere.com, found this hotel and walked round the corner to book it. It did not feel quite as welcoming but the location is as good, the rooms (and especially the bathrooms) are bigger and the buffet breakfast is excellent. Staff were friendly and everything was spotless. I cannot over-emphasize how much we enjoyed being in the heart of the Forum area. It is more extensive than I had expected and has an open aspect that makes much of the city seem cramped and noisy. Almost everything is in walking distance and the rest is a short one euro bus ride away. No need to have a hotel with a restaurant as there are plenty around every corner. Don't be put off by the cobbled street where this is located. It is safe and quiet with a view of the Colisseum down the next street. Only minor problem I had was that my iPod would not connect to the wi-fi in the room so I was back down in the lobby every day checking that damned cloud.....",,,
pandaeatworld,2515756,"This isn't a high-end hotel, it's not a fancy place, but the staff are friendly and helpful and the room is comfy and pleasant enough to get 5stars in it's bracket. This isn't a high-end hotel, it's not a fancy place, but the staff are friendly and helpful and the room is comfy and pleasant enough to get 5stars in it's bracket.","We choose this hotel based on many things, however we didn't know that it was across the street from a strip club. The place seemed very sketchy, the whole time we were there which was a lot because we had bad weather, it didn't seem like a very safe or secure place. During one of our 3 night stay people were talking outside our door and the staff didn't do anything about it, however the staff was friendly. The room itself had had patches of wall paper that looked like it had been cut out and then just put right back in the same place where you could clearly see where it had been removed. The socks to plug in lights didnt cove the whole circle of a hole there was, the blow drier was jim riged to the light socket. I thought, plugging in my own stuff was going to catch the place on fire. Anytime someone in another room was flushing the toilet or showering it was as if they were doing it in your room. We had our daughter with us and so I brought bed sheets just incase and I'm glad I did. The bath towels weren't very soft, but when we asked for more we got more. The hot water took awhile to get hot, it was a warmish feel and with bad weather I wanted a hot shower. Overall, our experience was not the most pleasant. The breakfast that is included looked home made and it was coffee and some biscuit thing (didn't try it) IHOP was next door so we went there. We would never stay her again or recommend this motel to anyone else. We weren't under the impression that this was a motel, and in dire need of updates/remodeling. This isn't a high-end hotel, it's not a fancy place, but the staff are friendly and helpful and the room is comfy and pleasant enough to get 5stars in it's bracket. and the only problem we had was with the key cards. Our room, my daughter and I, was right next to the elevator and we never heard it, we did hear people rolling their luggage and talking on the walkway but that was minor, there was also plane noise but since I live close to an air base it didn't bother me. This is an older hotel but very inexpensive, a great feature was the parking under the hotel and a laundry, not so good was the size and age of the towels, etc. There is a gentlemen's club across the street but we heard nothing from them, we were on the backside of the hotel. If the club offends you ask for a room in the back. We didn't use the pool or hot tub, too tired after walking around Sea World, etc. Would I stay there again, you bet. It was close to the public transportation and different venues. We used public transportation alot. Even though only 50% of travelers would recommend this hotel, I always find it impressive when the management responds to negative reviews like this hotel does-it shows they care. Anyway, I thought the location was great-very easy access to the freeway system, about 10 minutes from the Zoo, there was an In N Out less than 1 half a mile away, and there was a trolley stop with free parking about 1 mile away. Also, IHOP is right next door, as well as tons of shopping like Ross, TJ Maxx, and restaurants, etc within a 1 mile radius. There was a pool as well as a hot tub-didn't try either. Ice and water just down the outdoor hall. No elevator-didn't bother us. Also, the ac/heating unit is the old type that is either on or off-it can't self regulate. So when we came back after a long day the room was cold. Not a big deal as the heater worked awesome and would heat our room up in a couple minutes. There was breakfast served every morning, but very limited hours (7a-9a). We missed it both mornings. Woke up too late the first morning, the second morning we left too early. That was kind of a bummer-it was one of the reasons I booked this place. There was a micro and well as a decent sized fridge in our room. Also, a desk and chair. Shower/tub combo and good water pressure. Our first night, the area was very quiet-we slept awesome. The next night was NYE, so of course it was pretty loud with the club nearby. But didn't bother me. Also, covered parking was nice and since the hotel is so small, parking is convenient to the room. The front desk lady was very helpful, showing us where the trolley stop is. She was very nice as well. Overall, I am giving the hotel 4 stars. (the hotel states it is a 2 star, and I think that is fair-maybe a 2.5 star). 1/2 star deduction because our room was not serviced by housekeeping at all the 2 nights we were there. Did we call and complain? Nah, didn't care that much. The other 1/2 star deduction is because of the very short breakfast hours. Overall, I would stay again. Don't be fooled by there web site photos.They advertise a family inn, but this is far from that.I took my 8 yr old to Seaworld,and his first question was ""who's Larry Flint?"", the name he had read on the strip club across the street from Bay Inn and Suites. My family and I are from the Coachella Valley,and had no idea this place was in that kind of area.That's just the beginning. Very rude and disrespectful staff,Danielle and Barbara. Over priced for a place that looks like hideout for a Bad guy in a 1977 BERRATA episode.NOT A FAMILY PLACE !STOP DECEIVING PEOPLE.It sounded like we were not the first to complain. When you look at the first photo of this place, it looks like a nice Spanish style resort with whitewashed walls and a red tile roof. Not true! The place has been repainted a dull tan color, and the entrance is so tiny, you can drive right by it before you see it. The pool is small, lined with cracked concrete, and ice cold -- great if you are a midget who wants to practice swimming in ice water, not so nice for everyone else. You know if you drive from Dallas to Houston on the I35, and in the middle of nowhere, you see a ""Motel 11"" with rooms for $29 a night, right next to the freeway? And it is a long, two story building, looking like a cheap apartment building? Well.. that's what this place is like, but its jammed into a funky section of San Diego, right near the Marine base and directly across from a topless place. In fairness, the bed was comfortable. It's just that we were disappointed that we were not allowed to bring our llama into the room. Oh well.",,,
Kelly V,241705,"The service is excellent, everyone in the hotel is very friendly and polite, the breakfast buffet is really good, the rooms look very modern and clean, the price is reasonable and the location is very strategic. All of these factors contributed to making our stay in Rome a very positive experience! Being honeymooners, we were also given a 1 night free upgrade to a bigger & better room on our last night. I booked a whirlpool suite for a romantic getaway online at hotel.com the day before I was expected to come. When I arrived the next day, they told me they had overbooked and were unable to give me the whirlpool suite. I wasn't even notified before my arrival! Instead, they offered me a double bed room for the same price I paid for the whirlpool suite. I had to call hotel.com before 4 o'clock to cancel my reservation and had to book a new hotel room, which was seriously inconvenient! Apparently, a walk-in had arrived 30 seconds within the time I had booked the suite online and they were given the suite instead. It appeared they were low on staff as well. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. My plans were ruined due to them. My wife and I went to Paris for our honeymoon.

Being military I have slept in some, should we say, not so pleasant places so my view may be skewed a bit, not that of an average personÃ¢â¬â¢s, but I will try my best. Traveling as a solo male or a group of adults this isn't a bad place to use as a base camp. It is about 7 minutes east of the FQ by car off the highway. So you have to take a $20.00 taxi ride or pay to park. Depending on whatÃ¢â¬â¢s going on and how far away from the FQ you want to park that can be anywhere from 0-$25.00. The room was ok but I was only there for 5 hours to sleep. It was clean and the heater worked. It's not a place I would go if I was taking my family. There are no ""restaurants"" on that exit so you need to eat before you call it a day. They do have a Ã¢â¬Åcontinental breakfastÃ¢â¬ï¿½ but the gas station in front of the hotel has a little eatery that have very good breakfast biscuits at a reasonable price. But itÃ¢â¬â¢s not a restaurant. The worst thing about this hotel Ã¢â¬ÅifÃ¢â¬ï¿½ you are going to NOLA to party is the logistics it takes to get to the FQ if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have a DD.",,,
basilfriend,197798,"We booked here for a short 2 night city break and found it to be in a perfect location and within walking distance of the city centre. Lovely views overlooking the Prinsengracht canal, and very comfortable rooms with good showers and plenty of space. Breakfast was served in a small but homely kitchen/dining room and included nice quality breads, pastries, fruit etc. Also plenty of cafes nearby and with access to taxis also. Overall a very pleasant stay and would recommend to anyone (especially families) looking for a well priced, small and friendly hotel in one of Amsterdam's most desirable locations. Stayed in a top floor (attic-ish) room with my wife and 11-year old - plenty of room, nice bathroom. Pretty straightforward hotel, nothing fancy but elegant, spotless and friendly. Best is the location - on Echegary/Prado, a block from Pza Santa Ana - in the middle of the bustle and nightlife of Madrid. In the morning don't think about breakfast in the hotel (which is extra) - enjoy the calm and huge range of bars for coffee and a pastry...","The Orlando is in an excellent location at the quiet, mostly residential, end of Prinsengracht, which made it very peaceful at night while being only 20 minutes walk from most of the main attractions in the city centre. The hosts were friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. We are a family of five, and booked rooms 111 and 112, which meant that we had the basement floor to ourselves. Room 112 in particular was enormous, with plenty of room for all five of us to sit together while 'back at base'. Even though the rooms were in the basement, the huge windows let in plenty of light and air. We enjoyed the breakfasts, which set us up for the day, and found plenty of good places to eat nearly, especially just round the corner in Utrechtsestraat (Tempo Doeloe, for example). Top tip - book in advance online for major attractions (Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum) and avoid having to queue - we walked straight past a 90 minute queue to get into the Anne Frank House. We booked here for a short 2 night city break and found it to be in a perfect location and within walking distance of the city centre. Lovely views overlooking the Prinsengracht canal, and very comfortable rooms with good showers and plenty of space.

Overall a very pleasant stay and would recommend to anyone (especially families) looking for a well priced, small and friendly hotel in one of Amsterdam's most desirable locations. Have just returned from a trip with a friend and our two daughters. We stayed for 3 nights in the Orlando. The location is very convenient, about 20 mins walk to the Anne Frank House, and 15 mins or less to the start of the Museum Quarter, for Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum etc. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby. Located canalside, but away from the bustling centre, it suited us very well. We reached the hotel from Schipol by train to Centraal Station (EUR 3.80 adult, ÃÂ£2.50 children) and then taxi from thr station to the hotel (EUR 16). On the way back to the airport the hotel pre-booked us a taxi at EUR 35, which for the 4 of us worked out only a little more than our arrival option (and a lot less hassle with the carrying of bags!) The breakfast was great - delicious freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs, cheese, rolls, yoghurt, hot chocolate for the kids etc.. Very happy with our choice and would happily recommend. We stayed three nights in September. We had room 116, courtyard view and some steep stairs, for our first night and then had arranged to move to room 115, canal view and ground floor, for the next two nights. Both rooms were very nice and clean. Room 116 was very large. The pictures on the website accurately represent the rooms. Both rooms had a mini fridge with some items stocked but we liked that we could put our own items in the fridge. Breakfast was included in the rate and was a nice start to the day, breads, fruit, cereal, cheese, meat, boiled eggs, coffee and fresh OJ. The owner was incredibly helpful, carrying our bags up on the first day, providing us with a good map and help with the transportation system. We took a cab from the central train station on our arrival but used the tram on our departure. It was a 5 minute walk to the tram station. The hotel is in a very nice area with plenty of cafes within walking distance. It was a short walk to Rembrantplein, where there were lots of outdoor cafes and a tram stop. There was also a nice grocery store on the walk to Rembrantplein. We really searched long and hard for a canal view room on a first floor and while I'm glad we found it, you don't really see much of the canal due to the cars and the house boats, so I don't think canal view would be so crucial for the next visit. I really liked the hotel and would definitely return here. My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights beginning September 16. This is a lovely little hotel in a very good area. We had a canal view. A very good breakfast with fresh squeezed orange juice. Can't say enough about that. The owner is so helpful and nice. Our room was a spacious room and very comfortable. A very good location. We walked, with our luggage to a tram that took us to the train station on the day of our departure. I would definitely stay here again. My mother and I stayed at the Hotel Orlando for 6 nights in October/November 2010. It felt like home and was a great base to explore Amsterdam. The beds were comfrotable and the room large and very clean. We stayed in 115 which looked on to the canal. This was perfect for us because it was on the ground floor and saved mum from climbing stairs. The street was quiet at night. The rooms are spacious with high ceilings. Breakfast was made up of bread, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, yoghurt and coffee/tea and orange juice. This set us up for the day and we did not eat a meal until dinner time. Location is wonderful. It is within walking distance of most sites even though it looks a little far away on the map, it really isn't. A stop/go bus passes the hotel frequently and follows the Prinsengracht. You can flag it down and it will take you up down the canal. You can then walk through to Dam square etc. We used this bus frequently. It stops at the train station and one trip costs 1 euro. If you crave night life then Rembrandtplein is just up the street and there are many restaurants which we frequented on Utrechtsestraat nearby. There is also a small supermarket and laundromat very close by. I left my camera on the stop/go bus and with the help of Paul the owner of Hotel Orlando, I managed to get it back 6 hours after I had lost it. Paul kindly made phone calls and drove me to the bus depot on the outskirts of Amsterdam to retrieve my camera. Paul and his colleague Rose were wonderful to us and provided us with advice, called taxis for us and made us feel like we were staying at someone's home. Paul has opened some new rooms and they sound gorgeous. If you want to stay in a Canal house and leave feeling that you have been staying at a friends house then this is the place for you. Very clean and quaint hotel in central Amsterdam - I recommend it! My girlfriend and I stayed here for two (2) nights and would definitely return in the future. Nice Dutch breakfast in the morning and very comfortable beds. We have just returned from staying at Hotel Orlando, on the recommendation of my parents who have stayed there previously. They booked three nights in the hotel for us as a wedding present and we decided to go on the first bank holiday in May. Although we knew it was Queen's Day when we arrived on the Friday, we were not prepared for the spectacle that met us! The Dutch certainly know how to party! However, we found the hotel no problem, even though we were not able to be dropped outside, and we were in room 117. This light, airy and spacious room, complete with three windows overlooking the canal, provided us with the perfect base to sit and watch the festivities outside. The room came complete with a safe, TV and mini-bar, as well as a large, clean and modern bathroom with a great shower. The beds, although twins, were extemely comfortable and the hotel was charming. As it only has five rooms, you don't feel like you are in a large chain and it was very peaceful - with the exception of the party outside! Breakfast was wonderful - although continental in style, it was tasty and filling and set us up well for the day. Each day we had lovely rye bread, fresh croissants, bread rolls, ham, cheese, boiled egg, fresh orange, fantastic fresh coffee and a yogurt. The hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Amsterdam, both in terms of the sights and the restaurants and bars. We found the city small enough that we were able to walk everywhere, but there are always the options of the canal boat and the tram as well. Although there is no front desk at the hotel, we saw Rose every day at breakfast and they couldn't do enough for us in terms of booking a taxi to the airport, allowing us to leave our bags there on the day we checked out etc. All in all, a fantastic hotel and we would highly recommend it to any independent traveller visiting Amsterdam.",,,
RottenRonald,654186,"We stayed here with a group of 17 people celebrating a 50th Birthday and found The Monk catered to all our needs. Our diverse group covered the ages from 14 to 70 and the Nieuwmarket covered all possible needs from supermarket, market stalls, cafes and a coffee shop right on the corner :) I have been visiting Amsterdam for 35 years and the apartments are the largest accommodations I have ever seen in Amsterdam and larger than most surrounding homes. Most of the apartments have access to a balcony and our one bedroom apartment had two. The other main attraction is the location with lots of atmosphere and plenty to see. If you handle the stairs the penthouse has the best views and is a great space which we put to good use and had a cocktail party for 20 people. The bedroom door is a good laugh and is hung upside down and larger than the door frame. The front rooms overlooking the street and the first floor apartment seemed to be the only ones without access to a balcony. Must mention that whilst the balconies are a great spot to chill they are surrounded by residents who are quick to complain about any noise after 10pm. We were reprimanded 3 times but they did not realise we were from the same group otherwise I think they would have caused more trouble for us. It was around 10:30pm and we were not using foul language just laughing a lot but were threatened with the police. In summary The Monk was a casually managed complex with large well equipped apartments, in a great location and great value. Certainly deserves a higher rating. We had a 2 night stopover in Sydney and were lucky enough to book an one bedroom suite at an incredible rate. The suites are very comfortable, well decorated and a large bathroom with lots of amenities. We ate at the bar, Tapas style and found the food well above average. As throughout the hotel the level of service was exemplary and friendly. Definitely check out the pool. Highly recommended especially if you can score a good deal on a room.","We stayed here with a group of 17 people celebrating a 50th Birthday and found The Monk catered to all our needs. Our diverse group covered the ages from 14 to 70 and the Nieuwmarket covered all possible needs from supermarket, market stalls, cafes and a coffee shop right on the corner :) I have been visiting Amsterdam for 35 years and the apartments are the largest accommodations I have ever seen in Amsterdam and larger than most surrounding homes. Most of the apartments have access to a balcony and our one bedroom apartment had two. The other main attraction is the location with lots of atmosphere and plenty to see. If you handle the stairs the penthouse has the best views and is a great space which we put to good use and had a cocktail party for 20 people. The bedroom door is a good laugh and is hung upside down and larger than the door frame. The front rooms overlooking the street and the first floor apartment seemed to be the only ones without access to a balcony. Must mention that whilst the balconies are a great spot to chill they are surrounded by residents who are quick to complain about any noise after 10pm. We were reprimanded 3 times but they did not realise we were from the same group otherwise I think they would have caused more trouble for us. It was around 10:30pm and we were not using foul language just laughing a lot but were threatened with the police. In summary The Monk was a casually managed complex with large well equipped apartments, in a great location and great value. Certainly deserves a higher rating. Would like to say that this place definitely exceeded our expectations. We travelled in a group of 3. Did not really want to stay in a hostel, however we were in luck when we secured accomodation here. We actually came during a busy time as there was some Congress happening and alot of accomodation was fully booked for the week. We only stayed here for 2 nights but was definitely worth it. Convenience along with luxury best described our experience here. Cant spot any faults here as everything here was prestine. Clean rooms, bathooms, living room and we also had our own veranda. The apartment was just perfect. The apartment we got is a lot larger than I expected (based on some pics I found online). Overall the apartment we got was very spacious. The service was great and very very friendly. The apartment was very clean, very well furnished, comfortable beds, nice shower. Cheaper than any hotel. More privacy than any hotel. Over all just super. Arrived at The Monk Apartments and although there was no-one there to meet us, there was a note on the door advising to call when we arrived. Henk arrived within 5 minutes of me calling him. We were a group of 6 guys and and although we had booked an apartment to sleep 6 this would have meant two guys sharing one double bed. Henk noticed this and offered us the 2 bedroomed apartment upstairs completely free of charge as it had not been booked for the length of our stay. Amazing!! He even came up shortly after with a set of keys for each of us. Less than 10 mins walk from Central Station, the apartments themselves are modern, clean and have all you could ask for. A maid arrived each day and really we just asked her to empty the bins and give fresh towels as this was all we needed. It is in a really fantastic location with the redlight light district within about 50 yards but far enough away so that you wouldn't even know. The beautiful Nieuwmarkt Square and Waag are about 20 yards in the opposite direction. Everything you need is truly right on your doorstep. I would not hesitate to return to these apartments and would highly recommend to anyone. This apartment is located in a great spot. Close to the station, close to Dam Square, and within walking distance to all the museums and sights. (very close to the red light district not sure if this is good or bad... suppose it depends on how you feel about it) The apartments are clean. They provide linen, towels, various teas and coffees and plenty of crockery and cutlery as well a dishwasher, kettle, and toaster. One problem though our oven wasn't working. There is a lovely restaurant at the end of the road called De Waag and the apratment manager is a lovely gentelman who was very helpful. They also provide you with a stereo, TV, iron and ironing board. I am in Amsterdam on a project between 9th May and 13th June. i did not experience what you said in your comment. but we all need to understand these apartments are very old, about 400 to 500 years old. also considering garbage collectors in Amsterdam where on strike recently and these unit are in one of the busiest / dirtiest part of the city, such a experience is possible. to me any issue i had i just notice the staff and every thing fixed smoothly. I agree they may need to clean the units more frequently but this not a hotel, this is a serviced apartment. i think the rat, the noise and ... are a result of being in red light district rather than this specific apartments. I stayed here with friends and our initial reaction was that it was very spacious and nice. That was until we spotted mouse traps in the kitchen..and then later that night we spotted the mice!there were about 5 altogether running around the kitchen which stayed for most of the weekend. Its a self catering apartment but could defo not eat out of it as it was a bit filthy. The morning we were to fly home i woke up with little red lumps all over me. Im told they are bed bug bites. Disgusting but true!! Im back three days now and they still havent cleared up. The only good things about it was the fact that there was a balcony so that we could smoke as it is not allowed in the apartment and the location was also good. I would defo go back to amsterdam again but will certainly not be staying here again.",,,
ChantalNB,237397,"We really enjoyed our two night stay. Comfortable bed, clean room, lovely decor, deep soaker tub. Windows that seal shut to block noise. Location is good, walking distance to many attractions. Only complaint would be on the breakfast - some of the items, such as juice and coffee, appeared to lack freshness on both mornings. The boiled eggs, croissant and yogurt were good. The location is fantastic, so close to San Marco. Our bed was clean and comfortable, but the carpet and washroom could have been cleaner. Breakfast was bread and croissant with cocoa or coffee essentially. Given the good price and location, overall it was passable.","The location is fantastic, so close to San Marco. Our bed was clean and comfortable, but the carpet and washroom could have been cleaner. Breakfast was bread and croissant with cocoa or coffee essentially. Given the good price and location, overall it was passable. Basically arrived in the pouring rain off the airport boat at the San Marco pier & this was the first hotel was came across. 90 euro per night was steep for us however were expecting expensive anyway & did not want to trail around Venice in the rain looking for other places. Clean, tidy, quiet & warm - average breakfast compared to rest of Italy however it filled the gap. Very central & close to get boat to train station when we left. Reception men were very serious however no complaints at all. The only plus for this hotel is its location. The service from the front lobby staff was very poor. They were most unhelpful, in fact rude when I referred to a sent email asking for a specific room within this hotel. One would think that for 300 Euro a night and 3 weeks notice this small request could be accomodated. But no. I stayed 3 nights. The room was clean, upstairs fronting the street. The bathroom facilites were not of a 3 star hotel. Antiquated hair dryer a trickling shower that you had to hold. Then there was breakfast. One cup of coffee was all that was allowed. No cereal just a yoghurt and croissants. The pillows were like hardened clay. We were there early September 2011 and the days were hot but the air conditioner did work. We stayed four nights and found the location of the hotel very convenient for all parts of Venice. Venice is very different from any other european experience I have had, it was funny watching so many people trailing through the city towing suitcases, as there are no taxis or buses to the hotel door. This hotel is very convenient for the water taxis and vaporetto, a short walk from St Mark's Gardens and behind Harry's Bar. Our room was good for a short stay, the room was clean and well decorated and on the 4th Floor, the rooms were quiet internally but noisy if you have the windows open, please remember that this is a city of no vehicles so the only way is on foot and people walk though this area until about 1am, we were no troubled by the talking. The bathroom was ok, the taps etc could have done with a good polish, although this was carried out before the 4th night, probably a different housekeeper. Breakfast was very basic, tea and coffee, fruit juice (no choice), yoghurt and a basket of rolls, jam, butter and one cheese portion (dairylea); The front desk was efficient but no warmth to the welcome. I would give the restauraunts right opposite the door a miss, cheap and nasty, not just our opinion. This hotel is very well located. Rooms and bathroom need heavy housecleaning. Noisy rooms. Also found some very small insects n the bathroom. Front staff fairly friendly. Breakfast good for european standards but staff cold. I was supposed to be staying at Ca`del Campo Hotel,but when i arrived, they said there was water damage and i could not stay,so they had booked me into this one. Single room was tiny and dark, large newly decorated bathroom. The view looked onto a narrow dark street, good thing was there was no noise at all. Bed was rock hard. Breakfast was not very good, a ilttle basket with tiny little roll,croissant,a yogurt jams etc. Good points the staff were very helpfull, and the location was excellent, literally out of hotel,turn left, left at the end by Guetta store, straight on 1 min and you are in St Marks Square.(3 minute walk max). Free use of laptop with internet. I know you dont spend much time in your room,but i wanted a view of a little canal or a quaint street,as i would have got with my original hotel. If location is everything for you, perhaps worth considering, although im sure there are others. After a long flight to Venice from Chicago, I was excited to arrive at this charming hotel. Its pretty much what I pictured from the website. I was expecting to get a single room w/a single bed, but was given a double. The room was small, but its what I expected for Europe. The room was clean, bathroom remodeled new. Bed extremely comfortable (as all of the places I stayed in Italy). The location was perfect! its a 5 minute walk to San Marco Square. Dont expect to sleep peacefully here though. My room faced a bustling street which constantly had tourists walking/talking/laughing. I could hear everything even w/the windows closed! It didnt bother me, but if you want peace and quite, it may not be the place. The breakfast area was nice, but not much of a breakfest. Only a bread basket, and unlimited cafe's etc. It didnt bother me, since I liked to try other places. Tons of cafes, stores, shopping all near by with the attractions. Hotel staff was ok, not overly friendly. free internet computer is set up in lobby and you can have password for wireless in your room as well. I would stay here again for the location and the charm.",,,
EODUK,497525,"Not a bad stay, clean enough staff seem OK but didn't really have much inter action with them, most speak English. Breakfast was fine with a typical continental range, fresh coffee. I had dinner in the hotel and chose the set 4 course menu for â¬30 which I thought was value for money, the food was very good. Bed comfortable enough for me but may find the mattress too hard. Free WiFi but coverage intermittent. Would stay again if in the area. If you have to be at the Excel Centre for 2 days this hotel is fine for an overnight stay, paid Â£160.0 for one night, but all I was after was easy access to the Excel Centre for an exhibition I was attending. DLR on the doorstep, not a good place to get a black cab into London. Local minicabs avoid as they are foreign drivers who don't know London at all.

You LOVE the banging noise of heavy construction, early in the morning, even on Sunday. Have I got a hotel for you!! It's a pity that unworkable Wi-Fi and the ongoing construction across the street make the experience at Hotel dei Congressi so bad. The rooms are oldish but in very good upkeep, clean, pretty large for Rome, and well-lit (also unusual these days.) The restaurant is OK, breakfast good, staff friendliness so-so (again not bad for Rome). Location is far away from the tourist places but very easy to reach by Metro, balance good deal vs. scarce local amenities. But the Internet access is so bad it really spoils the experience. The hotels rooms are very dated. I had one of their ""best"" rooms. I had an electrical panel with fuses exposed by the door, old tired furniture and a TV that was about a17"" flat screen. Oh and the free wireless didn't work in their ""best"" room either. To top it off the room faced directly to a busy building site. Even noisy on Sunday. Not a bad stay, clean enough staff seem OK but didn't really have much inter action with them, most speak English. Breakfast was fine with a typical continental range, fresh coffee. I had dinner in the hotel and chose the set 4 course menu for â¬30 which I thought was value for money, the food was very good. Bed comfortable enough for me but may find the mattress too hard. Free WiFi but coverage intermittent. Would stay again if in the area. We've stayed in the hotel with my wife for 3 nights and hotel is just OK . It's just 5 minutes walking from the Metro EUR Fermi station but just near the station is an awful flea market ...Very very annoying.. The hotel itself is an old building with probably 15-20 year old furniture but it looks OK . We were allowed to check-in early at about 9:30 and we were very happy with it. Our room was large and clean with an 22'' LCD TV. Bathroom was clean as well. Probably the best thing is the free WI-FI connection. The breakfast was above average for Italy and the espresso is included. Staff was helpful, especially the night bartender. I've stayed in this hotel just for one night but I was happy with it. It's not in the city centre and you need to take a subway ( by the way one day travel card for subway cost 4e) but it only takes about 20 minutes to get there and than about 3-5 minutes to walk to the hotel from the subway station = really easy. The hotel is still facing a building site so it might be a bit noisy in the morning unless you have the room on the other site of the hotel I guess. My room was big, clean - the only thing I miss were the tea/coffe facilities in room (ok not each hotel have them) and it was easy to get the tea in the hotel bar - it cost 2.5E there. In the bathroom there were 2 small ""kits"" one with with ""brush"" to clean your shoes and the second one was with the hair band, few pads to remove your make up, small emery board and ""sticks"" to clean your ears - really cool. I arrived early - before check in time but i could left my luggage there and go sightseeing. And I was really, rally late for the breafkast but still was able to have it: there was bread, cakes, some ham, yellow cheese, white cheese, jams, joghurts - it was good enough for me.",,,
trip12345,185405,"We stayed one night to see this end of Paris. It is a expensive hotel but very luxurious. The hotel itself is a beautiful historic building. We had a good sized room with nice terrace which was clean. We arrived early and the front desk staff was very nice to get us in a room early. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and will return if I choose to stay near the Opera again. PS The Rossy Bus from the airport stops right across the street from the hotel which makes getting to and from the airport very easy This is an older hotel and not a typical Staybridge design. However, it is clean and well maintained. Nice breakfast and happy hour in the week. Nice looking pool, although not heated. There is a jacuzzi though. A great rate and near the Galleria mall. Would stay again if the rate is right. We stayed one night to see this end of Paris. It is a expensive hotel but very luxurious. The hotel itself is a beautiful historic building.

PS The Rossy Bus from the airport stops right across the street from the hotel which makes getting to and from the airport very easy Stayed here before an early flight out. Good shuttle service to and from airport. Friendly staff and clean rooms. It is not the newest but it has a nice atrium design and is well kept. They gave us free drinks because of priority club membership as well as continental breakfast which we missed due to an early flight. It also had a nice business center and restaurant with nice staff. Would stay here again due to location and price. (100USD incl. taxes) Nice hotel right on the magnificent mile. Took the subway in from O'Hare. No complaints except I wish they'd offer free internet. Clean rooms, nice beds, nice pool and workout room. This hotel is located right at the WTC. Came to Mexico City to sightsee but would recommend staying up at the Holiday Inn Express Reforma closer to Center Historico. However, this hotel was perfect for the price with friendly staff, business center, internet, breakfast, and clean rooms. If returning to the WTC area, I would definitely recommend it. We stayed one night on this end of HKG Island. Very modern. Quick and friendly check in. Because I booked on Expedia, internet was free. Clean room and a little tight. Nice big TV, desk, view, and bathroom although the""magic glass"" was different. Two blocks from the metro and shuttle from hotel to airport express for free. Fairly expensive as hotels seemed to be on a Saturday night. Didn't look for restaurants nearby although a McDonalds a block between the subway and the hotel. Overall would return if the rates are right.","Internet connection was impossibly slow (0.14 mbps) for most of my 16-hr stay. After technical support acknowledged the slow service, I took up the issue with management and the front desk, which dishonestly pretended that this was their standard for their offering of ""free high-speed Internet access"" and that there was nothing wrong with the service. All rooms are noisy (although worse if you face the freeway), so if you wanted to ""save"" time staying at this location, be sure you will not sleep comfortably. You are much better off having a good night sleep in any downtown hotel that adds only 10 mins of extra cab time to the airport (you will drive in the opposite direction of morning traffic!!), or at pricier Camino Real or NH right at the airport. The free shuttle adds only marginal value: it leaves ONLY once every hour and they INSIST you check in with their service 10 mins beforehand, leaving the hotel invariably 5 mins late for a 10 min ride, so it is not really time-saving (if you are downtown, an early-morning taxi ride will not take more than 15-20 mins vs the 25 min free ride of holiday inn). This is a great hotel, new and clean. The room was beautiful and had one of the largest, nicest bathrooms I have seen in Mexico. The bed was comfortable with fluffy pillows and nice comforter. The staff was very helpful. I ate dinner in the restaurant and although the menu was limited, the food was great! Best of all, they have a free shuttle that runs hourly between the hotel and the airport 20 minutes away. I would highly recommend this hotel because it is also reasonably priced (half of what the hotels at the airport cost). I picked this hotel because I had an overnight in Mexico City. The hotel is very close to the airport and has a free shuttle and free wireless. Once I cleared customs, I found the hotel office in the airport right across the hall from the exit. The office is just a small counter with coffee and couches but it was nice to sit and wait for the driver. The hotel employee quickly found my reservation and the hotel driver arrived right away. The hotel is clean and the rooms are very comfortable. I appreciated having a restaurant in the hotel. My ""european sandwich"" wasn't very good but the buffet looked nice. The return shuttle to the airport was very convenient and easy. I would stay here again just for the airport shuttle. Catching a cab from the DF airport can involve huge lines depending on when you fly in. I never left the hotel except to go back to the airport but if I was staying as a tourist I would stay on the zocalo instead. It didn't look like there was much in the neighborhood around the hotel. We needed to have a hotel close to the airport because of an early flight the next day. Relying heavily on the TripAdvisor reviews we decided to go with this hotel. I think it was a great choice at a reasonable price. We had no reservation but were able to get a room. It was spotless inside and had a great bathroom with more than enough towels. We went to the restaurant and found that the food was good and the prices were resonable for Mexico City. The bed was really comfortable and it was quiet enough for us to get a good nights sleep. The shuttle runs every hour on the hour to the airport. It was reliable. We had no trouble catching our flight. It took about 10 minutes to get to the terminal. Due to the location it's not great for tourism, but it is perfect for staying somewhere to catch an early flight. I mainly travel in the USA, but have made several trips to Mexico in the last 2 years. I have stayed at several hotels in Mexico. They have always been clean (I rely heavily on Tripadvisor ratings to ensure I am staying at a decent place)...but they are not typically anything to write home about. My flight into MEX was delayed, and thus I missed my connecting flight to Veracruz. It was late, I didn't have an internet connection, and I was at the mercy of the hotels that have small storefronts in Terminal 2 of the airport. It was so late that only two hotel desks were open. I picked the Holiday Inn and I ended up being very happy with the entire experience. Upon agreeing that I'd stay with them, a gentleman carried my bags out to the hotel shuttle. I was whisked to the hotel location, checked in quickly (friendly English speaking staff), and taken to my room. The hotel was beautiful (built on an Embassy Suite concept of an open atrium area that all rooms open to). My room was very modern, fresh smelling, and clean. The bed was comfortable, bottled water was supplied (at no additional cost, unlike USA hotels), the shower was powerful and hot, and the air conditioner kept the room very comfortable. Because I was simply grabbing a place to stay and my next flight was early the next morning, I didn't get to experience any other aspects of the hotel. Based on that, I can highly recommend a quick night's stay. When I left for my days business I returned to find my bed made but no towels replaced. The trash was not removed as well. The wireless internet had a lot of problems and when it worked it was very slow. Stayed here before an early flight out. Good shuttle service to and from airport. Friendly staff and clean rooms. It is not the newest but it has a nice atrium design and is well kept. They gave us free drinks because of priority club membership as well as continental breakfast which we missed due to an early flight. It also had a nice business center and restaurant with nice staff. Would stay here again due to location and price. (100USD incl. taxes) Enjoyed this Holiday inn a lot. Great restaurant and the food was excellent. Will stay here again! There is no store or restaurant within walking distance. You need a car or get taxi for shopping, So I had no choice having dinner except this hotel restrant. I ordered pasta which was extremely salty. I mean the chef must be dropped spoonful of salt on it. Next morning I had breakfast, I had to ask for butter for bread, ketchup for fried eggs. American breakfast comes with some Mexican black paste which taste not very good. Threr was no bath tub, only shower. $100 a night is way too high for this hotel This hotel is located in industrial area, This hotel is very inconvenient and I never stay this hotel again. Room was excellent, large, huge shower, amenities etc. Airport pick up, make sure take the phone number so you can call from the airport. Shuttle to the airport leaves every hour on the hour. Only downside, on a very heavily trafficked road, load, and heavy curtains don't close all of the way, not great for light sleepers. Very nice hotel, a little further from the airport than I thought, but the free shuttle was great. Also the Breakfast buffett didnt start until 7 and we had to leave before it opened. This hotel was near the airport, provided a free shuttle and was within walking distance of a subway station, which we took to the magnificent Anthropological Museum. The wait for the shuttle was long and the directions on the location at the airport were poor. The room was clean and comfortable, it was freezing cold and the controls were inscrutable. The running water in the hotel was safe to drink. We greatly enjoyed the breakfast buffet (not included), with a great variety of tasty hot and cold dishes including typical Mexican food.",,,
Mary Lykes,206924,"The hotel is in an historic building but, for us, the attitude of the hotel staff easily overcame any of the limitations resulting from the age of the building. In particular, receptionist Leaughan was most gracious as was the greeter who welcomes and seats customers at the hotel restaurant. Both of these young ladies obviously enjoy people. Note to Hotel Manager: give them both a raise! Although we are in our 60s, we walked to the hotel from the cruise terminal with our rolling luggage and again the next day to Union Station for our Amtrak train. Keep in mind this was in November when the weather was ideal. The location of the hotel was perfect - away from the noise of the French Quarter but within a 5 minute walk. Also, the St. Charles streetcar was one block away and the bus to Magazine Street was on the corner. Buy an all day pass for $3 and have a ball in New Orleans! Was everything perfect? No - the lighting in the small room was weak, the in room air circulator was a bit noisy and the doors of other rooms on our floor could be heard when closed. But we were not bothered too much because of the warm welcome and treatment we received from the moment we checked in. We had visited Barcelona before and were looking for a location away from the noisy and pricey Ramblas for a one night pre-cruise stay. This hotel met our expectations. Even though we are in our 60s, we bought a cheap shareable T10 ticket to get from the airport to the Barcelona Sants train station from which we walked to the hotel with our rolling luggage. The next day we took the Metro to the Drassanes Metro stop and then the blue bus (extra fare) to the ship. The neighborhood is quiet and there are lots of cafes and grocery stores nearby, which suited us well as we would be doing our fine dining once on board the ship. Staff at the hotel were very courteous. Considering the ease of transportation in Barcelona and the accessibility of the NH Forum to metro and bus lines, this is a good basic alternative. Metro to Ramblas took about 15 minutes. Great location close to Stanley Park and public transit. Downtown was not too far away. It is an older hotel and the room was smallish but the location and price made me very very forgiving. Friendly and very efficient staff. I used Priceline for a good deal and would be happy to stay at the BW Sands again. Central location, walking distance to subway, refurbished room with comfortable bed and accessories but there were some wacky design features such as bathroom sink that faced into a mirrored corner and a difficult to view TV screen. Pool was also distant from the main building. Staff was cordial but not overly friendly. Lots of restaurants in the complex were closed. Renovations gave the place a bit of a concrete monster feel. Renovations reduced elevators from two to one. Lots of nearby restaurants on Broadway. Staff was friendly. Close to really good public transit. Building and contents showing their age. Free luggage storage. However, there was nothing really compelling about this hotel that would make me want to return.

Whilst it's located a little way out of the centre of Barcelona, it's very convenient for the metro and for Sants Station (which has trains to the airport), so it's not that much of a problem. There are also some very good restaurants in the area around the hotel. Our room was large and clean, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was extremely peaceful. We stayed there for two nights on a busy weekend (Valentine's day). The staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful. The waitress in the breakfast room though could not speak English, but tried to understand. It was a very decent and comfortable stay. Breakfast was good with a great selection of anything you may ask for breakfast, although when something is finished it takes a while to replace it-or never if it is a late Sunday breakfast. Having the special weekend rate whic included breakfast and free mini bar, we were really happy with it. The only problem is that is more than 500m away from Entenca metro station and almost 1km from Sants, which is not very convenient when you carry luggage (also no elevator in the metro, as in most stations). But there also buses running very close. It easier to reach it from the airport if you take the bus to Plaza Catalunya and then either bus 27 or 30 (we took the train to Sants and then a taxi since it was close, and we had to pay 17 Euros for 1 km, as they charge 2 Euros per suitcase). Internet is very expensive (5,5 Euros for 1 hour and almost 11 Euros for 24 hours). Nevertheless I would stay there again (if it is for leisure and I don't need internet )!",,,
Lynne F,266705,"I was surprised by some of the reviews as I found this hotel offered excellent value for money. Yes, the single rooms are not large, but for one person I found the room more than adequate. Before I discovered Infanta Mercedes I was in a hotel with a much larger room, but breakfast there was 18 euros, wifi was slow and the price was a third as much again. While Tetuan is not a posh area, it is a regular neighbourhood and I never felt unsafe. It's also only 10 mins walk to the metro. Everything was clean, there was a bath/shower with plenty of hot water. I like that they have soap dispensers rather than little toiletries - much more eco-friendly. I enjoyed free wifi 24 hrs a day which was very fast & reliable. The buffet breakfast is included in the price and the selection was wonderful. Fresh fruit, cereal, hot food, cold food, pastries, all nicely presented. A great way to start one's day. Reception staff always very helpful and courteous. Loved the bowl of sweets on the reception desk. There is a lift in the lobby. My only concern was that I could hear other guests through the walls/ceiling, but that didn't overly detract from what I found to be the best value for money in the area. Each guest will weigh up what is important to him/her - for me as a seasoned traveller, I would definitely return here when in Madrid again. Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference and for me Hotel Infanta Mercedes served all my needs and more. Thank you. I found the reception staff helpful and pleasant and there was a bus service on metres away from the entrance taking me directly to the city centre. The room was cleaned each day during my week's stay and suited my needs well. Loved the deep bath with plenty of hot water. Would prefer to see little toiletries discontinued as there is so much wastage with small plastic packaging. Soap dispensers are more eco-friendly. Wifi was not always reliable and it was inconvenient to have to ask for a new password every 24 hours. Unlike previous reviews I had no trouble adjusting the cooling in the room. It was quiet and not so much light in the room that it bothered me particularly. I got the distinct impression that the focus in this hotel was on making money from business travellers whose company pays the bill, rather than provide service. For example, no tea/coffee in the room and this had to be paid for in the lobby along with everything else. I refused to pay 18 euros for breakfast, and walked to a nearby coffee shop instead. On my return to Madrid another hotel was recommended to me at a far cheaper rate, with excellent free wifi & a delicious, free buffet breakfast. From a seasoned traveller's perspective, you don't actually make money charging extra, instead you lose customers - worth keeping in mind. This hotel could be so much better simply by focusing on meeting the needs of guests, especially by including breakfast, providing a better wifi service and having an iron available.","I was surprised by some of the reviews as I found this hotel offered excellent value for money. Yes, the single rooms are not large, but for one person I found the room more than adequate. Before I discovered Infanta Mercedes I was in a hotel with a much larger room, but breakfast there was 18 euros, wifi was slow and the price was a third as much again. While Tetuan is not a posh area, it is a regular neighbourhood and I never felt unsafe. It's also only 10 mins walk to the metro. Everything was clean, there was a bath/shower with plenty of hot water. I like that they have soap dispensers rather than little toiletries - much more eco-friendly. I enjoyed free wifi 24 hrs a day which was very fast & reliable. The buffet breakfast is included in the price and the selection was wonderful. Fresh fruit, cereal, hot food, cold food, pastries, all nicely presented. A great way to start one's day. Reception staff always very helpful and courteous. Loved the bowl of sweets on the reception desk. There is a lift in the lobby. My only concern was that I could hear other guests through the walls/ceiling, but that didn't overly detract from what I found to be the best value for money in the area. Each guest will weigh up what is important to him/her - for me as a seasoned traveller, I would definitely return here when in Madrid again. Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference and for me Hotel Infanta Mercedes served all my needs and more. Thank you. I was booked into this hotel for a couple of days cause we wanted a city brake. It is located in a quite area of the city with a small square. Is situated close to a number of top sights in Madrid, including the Paseo de la Castellana, the Bernabeu football stadium, Congress Center and Plaza Castilla Square. Well-sized room with extremely comfortable beds, good bathroom with hairdryer, free wifi and good breakfast. Booked this hotel as I had some surplus Sol points and we wanted a city break. Hotel is in Tetuan and is not in a tourist area. However you do get a feel of how madrileÃ±os live. We sat in the big square one evening letting our daughter play with other local children and talked to some of the locals. The area felt safe but use common sense as in any city. Room was basic but clean and quiet. Breakfast was ok. Hotel is 10 mins walk from underground. Madrid is a great city, fantastic art galleries. Barcelona pips it on looks and atmosphere though Quite street but rooms poorly noise aisolated. Central heating is turned off, you have to guess how to turn it on..... Strong smell of black waters in the bathroom. Apart from that...... value for money If you want to hear what your neighbor is doing and also be told when can you feel warm or cold, this is your place! Although the location is good, it doesn't compensate for the nights without sleep. The walls of the hotel are paper thin and the street noise can be heard clearly. Now, the breakfast buffet is worth the price for the variety of fruit and pastries, but the sleepless nights or when you think that somebody is entering your room it is unbearable. Have sleeping pills handy when staying here! Great hotel. Front desk was always helpful and rooms along with the hotel very clean. There was a little mix up in my room, so the next night I was placed in a room closest to the street and sometimes it got a little loud in the evening because there is a little park in front. Not too big of a deal. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and/or stay again. The metro stop (Tetuan) near the hotel isn't super close, but just far enough from the heart of Madrid. Breakfast buffet isn't free, but it is good with a lot of variety. Not sure it is worth the 10euros every morning. Yes, it is a little annoying that wi-fi has to be paid for. I think it was only 3euros my entire stay, not much, but still a little annoying. Really though, this was a great stay. This hotel is very very affordable considering it has a restaurant on site, room service, a good breakfast, and very helpful front desk staff. Rooms are very clean, comfortable beds, and great bath. I love the quiet, safe, location that is near Tetuan metro line that goes directly to the center of Madrid. It is also very close to Vaughan Systems meeting point. After 10yrs of coming to Madrid, I now have found the hotel that I will be staying for my every visit. It is a great value for such a nice hotel. My second stay here the first time was when it was part of the Sol Chain of hotels...have great people at reception and gladly gave me an early check - in which was great because I had an early flight.. Overall its a good budget hotel and used normally by businessmen visiting Madrid. The only downside was they start cleaning rooms at 9 a.m. sometimes noisy after a heavy night out.. We stayed here one night after attending a family wedding outside Madrid. The hotel was in a quiet residential area of Madrid as we were visiting family near there that evening. We arrived around midday and were given our room immediately. Decent size with adequate bathroom, very clean and comfortable. Parking in the street and, as it was a Sunday, it was free until the following morning from 9.00 a.m., then payable. The hotel did not have its own car park so, if travelling by car, you would need to keep this in mind. However, it was fairly near the Metro system for travelling into the historic centre of Madrid. We didn't eat dinner there but there the breakfast was excellent - good choice of dishes with fresh fruit, eggs, pastries, etc. and excellent coffee (even though from a machine!). Friendly reception staff. We found it good value for a capital city hotel - we paid E70 for double room and breakfast. Small typical family restaurants nearby for eating out.",,,
cactie,535836,"We stayed 3 nights there. The hotel is a little bit far from the public transport. You have to walk 15 minutes to the nearst metro station (Plazza Republica or Termini). Our room is on the 1st floor. It's clear and not to small. But the bathroom is tiny :-(. You can only take a shower with very hot or very cold water. The staff is friendly. There are some restaurants around the hotel. The hotel is on the edge of the city, but the subway station or the bus stop is only 5 minutes' walk. The room was clean and quiet during our stay. The WLAN didn't work on the first day, but after we reported the problem, it worked again. The staffs were always friendliy. We paid only EUR 87 for 3 nights, in view of the excellent service, the hotel has really good value for money.","real good location,cheap and cheerfull stay had no complaints was clean and tidy and good location to get around,metro just a few mins walk down the street,would use again The Hotel Louisiana is an older hotel on the 4th floor of an older building. The room was typically European small but clean. The lift is small which required multiple trips to get our luggage up, a minor inconvenience. The staff is helpful, if not entirely engaging. The breakfast is the usual Italian breakfast fare--breads, fruits, coffee, etc. It is a reasonable walk to the city bus route, the hop on hop off bus and La Repubblica Metro. Our main complaint was the noise from the street below. There is a ristorante located nearby and the rowdy crowd kept going until the wee hours. Nothing memorable but it is clean and the price is very reasonable. For a short (2-3 day) stay it is fine, wouldn't want to stay for an extended visit. Very nice hotel, within walking distance of most of the main sites. Breakfast was a little bit disappointing but it did fill us up. We are happy with our choice and we feel we did get our moneys worth. We would stay here again. We where met by a room that felt like a sauna of air freshener, and a receptionist that had no idea of how to turn off the central heating...""it turns off automatically at 23.00""...a bit late for a good night sleep when you are not able to open the window in 1.floor directly facing the street!! I guess they used the air freshener to cover up the fact that all their rooms where smoking rooms, which was not mentioned in our booking site. To be honest the hotel did not really pick up after that! It is a 1 star hotel, and do not expect anything else! If you are in the habit of enjoying hot showers I hardly recommend to be out of bed before 8 in the morning, or you have to wait until 14.00. And the happily we spotted the bloodstains on our bed cover the first night. They say they have wireless internet connection, but that does not work!! As mentioned, not a hotel worth visiting, you can find better hotels in the same street for almost the same price!! We stayed at Hotel Louisiana for three nights over the weekend in Rome. It was a decent part of town and a convenient location to walk from the train (less than a kilometer). The reception desk was upstairs, which is strange and not perfectly labelled, but there is an elevator to haul luggage up. The hotel staff was adequately helpful, though I wouldn't give them any service awards. The room was clean enough, though the furniture was cheap and seemed easily breakable. There were scuff marks on the walls, which could be easily spruced up with some paint. The bathroom was big enough, though the shower head was old and leaky and the accordion doors didn't want to stay closed. The water temperature fluctuated quite a bit and the shower stall was quite small...smaller than other European hotels we've stayed. There was wifi available in the common area only, and was a little finicky to connect, but usually did so after some waiting. There was an outdoor area in the center of the building which was nice for sitting and relaxing in the evening and checking email, but smokers and mosquitos did hinder our enjoyment. The included breakfast was pretty light compared to other hotels, but sufficient. The hotel is quite central, situated about 5 min from the subway line station. Even if we were shoched when we first saw the building (I checked the adress to be sure), the interior wasn't that bad. The building holds more hotels, our reception was at fist flour and our room at 4th flour. The floor and the rooms were renovated and looked nice and clean, bath was large enough. What I disliked was the fact that the wireless was working only at the first flour, but even if I managed to get a poor connection, at this floor I didn't have network for the telephone! So in fact I did not have any wireless working! Another bad thing was the breakfast - very poor and only sweet, cold things - cold croissants, jam, honey, butter, cereals with cold milk, bad cofee and juice- I hated it from the first day and hated it more every day. It would be nice to have more diversity and not only sweet things! The staff was ok, some more kind than others. Overall, it's a good hotel for a limited budget, cause Rome is quite an expensive city! We stayed 3 nights there. The hotel is a little bit far from the public transport. You have to walk 15 minutes to the nearst metro station (Plazza Republica or Termini). Our room is on the 1st floor. It's clear and not to small. But the bathroom is tiny :-(.

Great location near Termini station and close to most of old town attractions. Clean, spacey and quiet rooms and nice breakfast (not to many choices but you can eat as much as you want).",,,

The rooms are always clean and ready when we arrive whether it's before check in or late evening. The breakfast is always ready when it is supposed to be and items are fresh and restocked when they become depleted. Close enough to the expressway but not too close that all you hear are the semis rolling by. Good food/restaurants along with fast food close enough via the car. (within a few minutes) Downtown is less than 10 minutes away if you want to go shopping at the mall. No issues at this hotel! Will be staying there next Jan again and maybe in April of 2012 (if we decide to return to Indianapolis). Spacious rooms is a plus at this suite hotel. Some hotels claim they are ""suites"" but you are cramped in. Partial divider between pull out sofa and beds make it nice! You won't be disappointed. We just returned from a several day trip and stayed at this Comfort Suites. We were greeted by friendly desk clerks. The hotel is very comfortable and clean, rooms were very spacious. The breakfast was adequate for our purposes, included in the room cost. Overall very pleasant experience. We will be returning to this hotel. Why? Because the price was terrific and offered us a large suite type room with continental breakfast. (The kinds of continental breakfasts offered at these type of hotels are not that great but that's not why we stay at there.) The location gets you quickly downtown or to the airport plus Steak n'Shake is right across the street!!! Two of our friends got married, and arranged for out-of-towners to stay at the Comfort Suites-Indianapolis on Kildeer Drive (Southport Rd. exit on I-65). What a great place! The suite was fine, the bed was comfy, the place was very clean and the staff was terrific! And you couldn't beat the rate they offered for the wedding guests! Downtown is just a short drive away, and the hotel is surrounded by good places to eat, including one of Jimmy Buffet's ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" outlets. If you are some big-time celebrity, you won't be interested in this hotel. But if you are an average middle-class couple who is looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay in Indy, offering free breakfast, check out the Comfort-Suites on Kildeer Dr. on the south side of Indy! HillaryMills Very sweet and helpful great room . Wish to meet more people like her. newer facility, convenient to several area restaurants. far enough off highway to be quiet, but still convenient to I-65. very friendly staff, spacious clean rooms, frig/microwave, comfortable bed. breakfast is quite adequate....pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereals, hard boiled and scrambled eggs, and sausage (although i have to admit it was ""different looking""). lots of area restaurants nearby. We always stay at this Comfort Inn and Suites whenever we have our grad school class in Indianapolis. Melissa and Constance are amazing, so nice and very helpful! I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will come back whenever I'm in town! My two young children and I stayed for two nights for a wedding. The room offered a large king sized bed with lots of comfy pillows and bedding. It also offered a hideaway bed in a couch. The room also offered a closet to close clothes up inside rather than the typical exposed closet by the bath room. The bathroom was roomy and pleasant - typical hotel bathroom except a nice size and clean. The room decor was very pleasing - it didn't feel like this was some age old hotel. The hotel also offered an impressive workout room with a full set of free weights, half and whole balance ball, treadmill, eliptical, weight machine, water, lots of towels and it over looks the salt water pool with hot tub. The breakfast was fine - lots to chose from though the eggs were not very good. Though the carb selection included bagels, oatmeal, cereal, and fresh waffles. I highly recommend This one had the strengths of other Comfort Suites: Big, comfortable, clean, modern room,with good bedding. Very nice staff. It's right off the highway, but not really close to downtown Indianapolis. Lots of dining options in the area, however, the entire neighborhood smelled of fast-food frying. Breakfast also wasn't quite as good as I've had at other properties of the same brand, and they weren't as good at keeping it stocked. Slow, unreliable wireless connection with many interruptions was a disappointment. My wife has had to have surgery in Indianapolis twice this year and we have had to have other doctor visits before her surgery and as I have had luck with most (not all) Comfort Suites, I though this one seemed ok according to the reviews. The little night hostess has been there every stay and knew us after only two trips there by last name when we walked in the third time in a four month span. She works hard to please the customer and was very impressive with her service for us each time we stayed. We even complimented her to the manager the next day before we checked out after our second stay. The rooms are huge and everything is very clean. I usually leave a tip when the room in a motel looks like an extra effort has been made to clean it up well and have left one here all three stays. We will be back there later this month and I hope that this great service during these trying times of illness for my wife continue as they are much appreciated. Ask about the discount rate if you are going to local hospitals for sugery/ appointments as this makes a great place even better with a great deal. (We were told about this by the night hostess.....Thanks!!) I stayed here because my reservation at another hotel down the highway was messed up and they were fully booked. It's a little tricky to find (it's behind the Speedway gas station), but it's close to the highway along with other comparable hotels. Being a walk-in, I was expecting a high price, but the price was actualy $10 cheaper than the other hotel I tried booking...bonus for me. Extremely nice, clean, up to date room. I didn't try the buffett, but there was a Cracker Barrell within walking distance as well as other restaurants close by. No gripes or suggestions at all. Would definately recommend it. We stayed at this hotel as we were traveling to South Carolina. Great location and very new and clean! Right off I-65. We had a very spacious room with separate sitting area. Breakfast was also good. Highly recommend.",,,

While the room was small It was neat, clean, modern and well equiped. It even had a small fridge but that had to be removed from its cupboard in order to get it to work. Staff were very friendly and professional. While the room was small and the price high, that is what is to be expected in central Paris. The location is excellent with easy access either by foot or Metro to all the major sites. We did not partake of their morning breakfast, seemed a little expensive, so we can't comment on the food but the breakfast facilities looked pleasant. We would stay here again without hesitation if we return to Paris. booked this last minute and was taken by its quirkyness. Enjoyed my stay. The quirkiness though is superficial -nice ideas but did not have the vibe portrayed. But a clean room and bed in a conveneint location was enough for me. One word of caution - it is in the middle of a corner with 4 sex shops. Wasn't expecting that...and would not advise for families ! Fully agree with the other positive reviews. Very well located; nice, modern and clean rooms; friendly staff; nice shower! We will come back! Very clean, great location, experienced and helpfull stuff. I surely would stay there again. Worth paying 140 euros for double room. Thanks God i found this hotel after a nightmare lived in Helder Hotel for 12 hours, that i afford it. While we were there, the hotel was still undergoing renovations and updating and while normally, that would have been a hassle, having been through the same thing for 8 weeks at home in Sydney it was merely more of the same! The design details of the hotel are lots of fun and rooms are very individual in their design details. The beds are really wonderful! We loved the hotel and its Madeleine locale where there are great shops, good local restaurants which are also reasonably priced and of course, right around the corner, Fauchon which has very good coffee and food at a premium price. (Paris is notorious for very bad coffee virtually everywhere!!) (Tip within a tip: really great coffee can be found at the cafe restaurant atop BHV, rue de Rivoli, which has to be one of the best department stores anywhere - better than Printemps and Galeries Lafayette!!) Hotel du Triangle d'Or offers a 15 E breakfast which is a great way to start the day and this includes good coffee! Staff are excellent and personable. The lift in the hotel can be in demand at certain times and being small will take two and some luggage at a pinch in a silver glitter cocoon.",,,
Naples64,291922,"Venice was our last stop on our trip to Italy and I was looking for a hotel with a canal view. The location was perfect - right on the San Marcuola boat stop. We arrived by train and walked there ( about 15 mins) but I would recommend just catching the boat. Our room was on the corner so we could see a little side can from both windows. We loved being able to look out and see what was happening ...gondolas, people delivering furniture etc. The rooms have air conditioning but you need to ask to have it turned on. The staff were incredibly helpful and we got some great recommendations for dinner, coffee etc. We only had 1 night here coming back from Venice and flying out from Rome airport the next morning. We had chosen the hotel for its proximity to the railway station - very close and easy to find. The room was spacious with a balcony and beautifully decorated. There was a spa bath with an over the bath shower. The water from the shower was a little hard to contain as there was no shower curtain or glass...but not a major issue. When we told them we needed to leave at 5.15am the next morning they organised a breakfast for us and had delivered to our room for us without us even asking! You can't ask for much better service than that.","As someone already mentioned, I was too expecting a bit more for 150euro a day hotel. --- Positives: --- Locations was great, vaporeto station 20 minutes from hotel door; not too far from anything. Clean - ish. Breakfast was served rather than self-served. --- Negatives: --- Visited in February so heating was required, which was using a noisy air conditioning device. Found hard to sleep with constant noise coming from air conditioning device over my head. Floor was a very cold concrete and there were no carpets. Had to put my boots on just to go to the bathroom. Blankets looked tatty and not in sheets. I really hope they were washed for every customer. Stayed for 3 days and all three days breakfast was exactly the same - cold and a bit boring. We paid for canal view room but you could hardly see the very small canal so not worth to pay more for it. This hotel is only small and is very well situated right by the canal - 2 vaporetto stops from Santa Lucia Railway, and a nice walk from Rialto! The rooms are quite large and comfortable, and the reception staff were very friendly and most helpful. The breakfast was great, and again nothing was too much trouble. We organised a gondola ride starting in a side canal just near the hotel. It was wonderful - all through the back canals and 2 crossings of the Grand Canal, and for half the price of those from San Marco. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, or you can just catch the vaporetto right outside the door and go further afield. We have stayed in Venice before, but this is definitely a little gem. Venice was our last stop on our trip to Italy and I was looking for a hotel with a canal view.

We had a small room with a window on the street, but it is very quiet, so that was no problem. I guess the rooms with a canal view are great, but probably they also are quite a bit expensive. Another good thing is that is is less than a minute to walk to the water bus. I would advice everybody to buy a ticket for the number of days you stay right away. It may seem expensive, but afterwards travelling with the boat is free :-) Walking to San Marco takes something like half an hour. Nice, but you do not want to do it many times. The lady who welcomed us in the reception was very nice and took time to explain a lot of things. Also there are nice restaurants in the vicinity that give you a much better deal than overpriced lot around San Marco. The breakfast is just acceptable, but the coffee is horrible compared with normal procedure in Italy (yes, Norway is another story).",,,

The most annoying was someone with a loud muffler on his truck and he would just sit in the parking lot and rev his engine over and over and then he'd tear out of the lot. About 1/2 hour later he'd tear back into the parking lot and rev his engine some more, go back inside and the the whole process would repeat itself over and over till about 6am when it finally stopped. The front wall (with the window and door) of the room felt like it was being held on with masking tape because we could hear everything that was going on outside. Every drunk person throwing up, every drunk couple stumbling up the stairs, everything! The rooms themselves were standard Motel 6 fare (retro blue/yellow/red bedspread) and an old TV. We tried to plug in our cell phones and lap top in the only outlet in the bedroom area and the wall plate fell off the wall with plaster crumbling to the floor. The only time I would recommend this place is for an emergency situation and you have nowhere else to go or you are on such a tight budget that the things I mentioned above don't really matter to you. I stayed here once about a decade ago and was pretty impressed back then. Itâs not quite as good as it used to be but still probably the best budget place to stay near Seattle. The biggest shortcomings would be the limited number of towels and pillows provided and the ancient TV. The big plus other than price is the epic water pressure in the shower. Location is just a few exits from Seattle, which works well if youâre driving but if you donât have a car donât even bother considering this location. Thereâs nothing really in the area and itâs not the easiest place to find but if youâre just passing through on a road trip or just donât want to pay hotel prices in Seattle this is a pretty good place. Iâll probably return if Iâm in the area and looking to save a bit of money.",,,
anil_talasli,559363,"I have been to Bebek Hotel several times but the last one was worth mentioning. I've made the reservation for June 26-28 in March and they told me that the reservation for room no. 405 was made. Since the rooms with street view were too noisy I first asked for a sea view room.Since all the sea view rooms were reserved I asked for a street view room upstairs. When I came for check in they gave me room no. 101 which is at the first floor and very very noisy. I changed the room the other day but I had a terrible night. I could not understand why they gave my reserved room 405 to somebody else. It is been quite a disappointing experience. I can only advise you to stay at rooms with sea view... The hotel is at the heart of ÃÂ°stanbul.The rooms are well-equiped and clean. I highly recommend the rooms with bosphorous view. The breakfast service is good but was better before. The hotel is excellently situated on Passeig de Gracia, in L'Eixample. Although we arrived early on Monday, our room was ready, and had a private terrace as we requested. As soon as we entered to our room, they kindly sent a bottle of Cava and chocolate truffles as they knew that it was our honeymoon. Hotel's services were amazing. Everyone at the front desk was helpful, friendly.We really loved this hotel.","This is a lovely hotel, with good rooms (small, well-appointed suites really) overlooking the Bosphorus directly. Staff very helpful (not always smiling but always knowledgeable and very nice). Tasteful rooms and much comfort. A bit far from tourist attractions, but the bus and taxi systems work well. Bebek is an upscale part of Istanbul, slight far from the main tourist landmarks but has a busy high street, number of very nice restaurants, bars, etc. Bebek Hotel is a small charming hotel on the main high street on the edge of the the Bosphorus. I stayed in a room with the Bosphorus view which is phenomenal from a view perspective with a decent size balcony. The room itself was also very well decorated and spacious. Bathroom was also nice but the shower worked adequately. Could 't help but agreeing with some of the reviewers below about the service. There wasn't any untoward incident as such but 'service with a smile' was somewhat missing. The breakfast area is also well located next to sea - however we sat inside given the January weather - but the selection somewhat limited. Overall, a very pleasant hotel in a nice part of town - ideal for a romantic trip but do go for the sea view room. I have been to Bebek Hotel several times but the last one was worth mentioning.

albyIMF,612937,"I stayed in Hotel Clodio in the first weekend of October 2011 for work. The hotel is located just below the âMontemarioâ hill near the headquarters of RAI. The hotel is officially a 4 stars hotel but when you get out of the elevator I canât find immediately my room â¦. My room hasnât have the door as the others rooms because it was in renovation â¦ so I check all the other room numbers to be sure that the horrible door was effectively my door room. The room is quite spacious but the furniture is old and you have the sensation that all the furniture would be renovated and not only the door!! The hotel has a nice terrace on the roof which is divided in 2 parts: on the left side you have nice sofa and low table, on the right side there are some tables and the chairs very old!! Please renovate all the terrace!! The terrace is just below the âMontemarioâ hill and you can see a nice view!! The breakfast in nice with a lot of good food where you can meet some Italian TV famous people. The hotel is not a 4 star hotel without a renovation in the rooms!! I stayed in Grand Hotel Fleming in the first week of October 2011 for work. The hotel is located near the âForo Italicoâ so itâs very far from the downtown (about 25-30 minutes by taxi) and the only way to come to downtown itâs to take a taxi because there is a near underground stop!! Be aware that the Grand Hotel Fleming is the typical hotel where organized tour with big Pullman come with a lot of people â¦ so if you make the check in when arrive the organized tour will be wait a lot of time!! The room was very bad with old and low quality furniture and there is also a bad smell. The bathroom was so little that when you open the door you must watch out because the bidet is just behind the door!! The air conditioning is very noisy and if you can sleep you must switch off!! The room is embarrassing for a 4 stars hotel!! The breakfast was terrifying â¦ there were so poor food and with low quality!! The hotel is not recommended!! I stayed in 207 Comfort Inn B&B in the second week of October 2011 for work. The B&B is located in Viale Giulio Cesare and itâs not far from the Vatican (about 10 minutes by foot)!! The B&B is also 50 metres near the âOttavianoâ underground station â¦ so you can take the Underground to go to downtown!! The B&B has a front desk open 24 hours so if you arrive late in the evening itâs better to call them!! The B&B is at the first floor of an normal building but inside itâs quite modern!! The room is normal (not large and not small) and the bathroom is useful but not too big!! The room is located in Viale Giulio Cesare which is a very busy street so itâs better to sleep with the window closed!! The breakfast is served by the waitress in the room at the time you have defined with the front desk staff but itâs very poor breakfast!! Itâs true that a lot of B&B have a poor breakfast but they could improve the service without a big effort!! So I suggest the 207 Comfort Inn B&B if you donât want a luxurious room and service!! The quality / price ratio is good!!","Ideal for visiting the Vatican and within walking distance of most places of interest. 5min walk to metro station. Our room faced the main road, which is rather busy and can get a bit noisy at night. However, after all the walking during the day we slept like a log anyway, so the noise didnt bother us too much. Very friendly staff. Would go back I was arriving in Rome for a study abroad program and needed a place to stay for the night prior to my accommodations becoming available. I researched the options on Tripadvisor and wanted something close to the Vatican, as St. Peter's Square was a priority of mine to see first. 207 Inn was extremely comfortable and offered a great base of operations for that first day in the city. Great view of the busy street below, too! Very helpful staff and a tasty breakfast. A great base for exploring Vatican and Rome! Near Ottaviano station (Line A). The hotel is located on the 2nd floor of an typical roman building. The elevator is also old and at the same time very romantic. Rooms needs to be renovated (dirty walls) and TV set to be repaired. Breakfast was served to the room: juice, croissant and tea or coffee, so perfectly acceptable for a decent start for the day.

The quality / price ratio is good!! I stayed there with my girlfriend at the end of september 2010 and decided to opt for a room with a balcony even though we were told the room would be small with a tiny bed. We were surprised when we saw more or less a normal size bed. As we were spending most of our day sight seeing we didnt mind having a smaller room as the balcony more than made up for this. The hotel is very very clean, probably the cleanest place I have stayed, and the staff are extemely helpful and friendly-we didnt have any problems with language either as their English was good! We were seved breakfast in bed every day and had a choice of times for it to be delivered. There were plenty of inexpensive restaurants on our doorstep as well, along with a very cheap market just in front of the hotel. It was still quite warm when we stayed at around 27 degrees every day, but the room had air conditioning. Ottaviano Metro stop and the vatican are literally a stones throw away, so an excellent location for sightseeing. All in all I had a great time here and would definitely come back again. YOU SHOULD AVOID THIS HOTEL...I'M WARNING YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE I made a booking to this hotel for more than a month and found out upon arrival to the hotel that the room just gone due to a problem with booking!!!!! It was an absolutely unacceptable reason and poor management since it supposed to be informed few days ago so that I could reorganize the hotel booking. I don't need to stay to that hotel, but finally I knew from the hotel reception after carring more than 40 kgs heavy weight bags via a long journey. Luckily, I arrived around 4-5 pm so I could rearrange the accommodation. WHAT IF YOU ARRIVE LATE AT NIGHT????????? it will be absolutely nightmare for you... So I'm warning you.....avoid this hotel.. It's so risky to find out yourself has no room to sleep. Expectations is what it is all about. Hubby & I stayed at 207 for 3 nights before a Meditteranean Cruise with 2 other couples. Granted, our room was very tiny in comparison to what we are used to but we found it quaint, with a wonderful balcony where we could have a drink and watch the Romans at work and play. It was all clean and the great thing was that it was close to the Vatican and within walking distance of what we wanted to see. We also got the bus to go to the colloseum and other places. We didnt notice the noise at all and anyway, who wouldnt want to be serenaded by the local market stall owner who saw us sitting on the balcony having a vino! There were larger rooms available but without a balcony. It was a small (pardon the pun) price to pay to be able to use this at night and in the early morning which is the only time we were really in the room (who wants to watch TV when you are in Rome!). For breakfast we just did what the locals did and had a coffee and a pastry standing up at the little shop just a few doors away from the hotel (the owner was very accomodating with our lack of Italian but we did try!). In regard to the front desk there was a small problem with the language barrier but they did try thier best and were very polite if a little reserved. I found nearly all of the places in Italy that we visited wonderful and the people very willing to help you if you tried to speak a litte of their language. As my husband is fond of saying ""Its all part of the experience"". I would definitely recommend this hotel but only if your expectations are realistic.",,,
divvy_l,2013911,"In a country where, overall, service can be too often unknowledegable, brusque or dismissive, this SIngapore mainstay does well to rise above a number of its competitors with an assured level of service without falling back on any other aspect of its offering. During my recent stays I have at no point been dissatisfied and I would have no question about basing myself here in the future. This well-located hotel is readily accessible from the airport without encountering traffic and is located short metres away from Marina Square and Suntec City as well as the Esplanade MRT; the Esplanade district itself is a short stroll away. Taxis are almost always on call here in contrast to some other locations around town. The public areas are sharply executed and well-staffed. This is also reflected in the rooms - floor to ceiling windows let in plenty of natural light and sharp views. There is plenty of desk space and an expansive and tastefully-outfitted bathroom with quality toiletries. The executive lounge too performs well with pretty views across Marina Bay and a high-quality execution of the Hilton breakfast buffet and afternoon buffet, with a high-tea buffet to boot. Breakfast at Oscar's is on the extensive side (an ice-cream bar at breakfast? certainly complements the made-to-order waffles nicely). However it is in service that this hotel distinguishes itself. From the courteous and helpful check-in, where real upgrades are given happily and proactively, through to the restaurant staff, the business centre staff and housekeeping, the service is not just obliging but thoughtful and comfortable. I usually ask a lot of difficult questions of hotel staff but I was never disappointed with an answer I received here. I would definitely recommend this for short and long-stay travellers as somewhere where you can genuinely feel comfortable and at home. I will be back. The rooms are pleasant enough, there is free wi-fi, you can watch hundreds of cable TV channels and the breakfast on the roof is quite acceptable. I can't think of any flaws in the hotel. However the true standouts here which make this place excellent are the service and the location and all the reviews on TripAdvisor are justified in lauding both. The hotel is in the heart of Sultanahmet - so if you want easy access to all of the major tourist sights, and a sense of the Old City, then this is a very good base. The Hagi Sofia and the Blue Mosque itself are 2-3 minutes stroll away and the oft-lauded Cagaloglu Hamami is around the corner. There is a tea shop three doors down and a small grocery store across the road. Even the tramvay stop is not more than 100m walk away and from there it's easy going to the Spice Market and Kirakoy. There are plenty of acceptably-good restaurants nearby although for the fashionable places where the locals eat and drink you'll have to go to the other side of the Golden Horn. The service is superlative; it is personalised and thoughtful without being intrusive or patronising. Eve and the team treat every guest with a personal touch - I sat in the lobby at one point (trying to sort flights the evening after I had checked out) and I saw her greet every guest in the door and discuss all matter of things that guests were interested in with some depth of knowledge. Gifts on arrival and departure are also a nice touch. All the staff are incredibly obliging and give this hotel a massive edge. I would definitely return given these two factors. It has the feel of an apartment with a friendly local downstairs and it is hard not to feel at home. This is a great value find for someone looking for a stay with a more personal approach. The nine rooms of the hotel are on half of a floor of an otherwise normal building. This is right above the Furio Camillo metro station (on the same line as the stops for the Termini station, the Spanish Steps and Via Veneto) but the surrounding area really is unremarkable and you are dependent on the metro, which due to construction at the moment is only open until 9pm (after which there is a bus replacement). The rooms, while not large, have a modern and comfortable fit-out which appears relatively new. Having stayed in two different rooms there is some variation - one was over the road and had quite a bit of traffic noise, but one overlooked a rooftop garden area with a French window arrangement. The beds are very comfortable and every room is fitted out with security cards. They centre in on one main corridor. Noise does resonate a little within the hotel. There is free wi-fi and a basic continental breakfast in a small breakfast room. Service is very intent and will be appreciated by those who like the concept of being hosted. All in all it fits the style of a pension (albeit one which is not in the middle of a particularly charismatic area but is accessible to them). For the amount I paid I was really quite satisfied and I would certainly recommend it to those looking for this style of hotel in Rome. I feel this could be a very good hotel - but isn't. While I have only stayed here once (and I came wanting to like the place) I have learnt enough to doubt whether I would consider returning. In principle there is quite a bit to like about this hotel. It is in a tasteful building with a pretty lobby (although not immediately at the vehicular entry to the hotel) and is attached to the charismatic Bugis Junction shopping centre (with classical Singaporean shopfronts in airconditioned comfort as well as an MRT station). Sadly the finishing touches are what are lacking. The rooms feel cramped and the views (even on high floors) feel industrial and constraining. Although there are Elemis toiletries in the bathrooms, and a pleasant fruit bowl is provided on arrival, the installations seem tired. Wait staff, although doing their job technically adequately, were tired and disinterested. Service in fact was often brusque. I was interrogated for sitting in the lobby without ordering a drink (I understand there must be problems with flow-over from the shopping centre, but I was reasonably well-dressed and the majority of tables were empty). After late check-out was granted I was called three times in the hour before the agreed time asking whether I was ready to check out yet. The check-in staff were unwelcoming and disconnected - and while I admit bias in that my Priority Club Gold status yielded absolutely no upgrades or concessions (which is their entitlement), my friend (who is Priority Club Platinum and a member of the Ambassador program as well) got an upgrade in name only (his room was exactly the same) and was denied access to the club lounge. If you can't please that kind of customer with what they would consider basics then you have got problems. All in all it certainly does not make a compelling argument to return. While it isn't a four star hotel, frankly in this price range it should be doing much better.","Great experience staying there. Very clean and new rooms on top of friendly service. It is right next to the metro station and you can go everywhere in Rome in just a few minutes. Staying a little bit out of the city center and turistic places help you to taste authentic italian restaurants paying good prices. Recommend also Ristorante da G Roma, just around the corner. Friendly people and good food. This is a great value find for someone looking for a stay with a more personal approach.

The rooms were very stylish, and equiped with everything you needed. A bit out of the city center, still walkable though, but right next to the metro line A. Via Appia offers great shopping, and just around the corner from the hotel a very authentic roman restaurant. This is a lovely, quiet hotel. The rooms are designed with real thought. They are clean, roomy and comfortable. The staff at the hotel are extremely friendly and helpful. If you need anything, they are there to help you out. The location is good. It is located right next to the metro and only 6 stops to Termini station. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if in Rome. This hotel is a real gem. It is located just next (literally 7-8 meters walk) to Furio Camillo metro station (from where Termini or the Spanish Steps is a matter of a few minutes). The interior is beautifully decorated, and the rooms are at the levels of 4* hotels. Everything is really tasteful and functional. Breakfast is included in the price, and there is fridge with water, beverages and snacks for free use in every room... Beds are great and the place is very quite for relaxation once you return from your exploration of Rome. The hosts are very kind, unobstrusive, and very helpful. In its price this hotel is just one of the best places to stay - literally 4* accommodation for a 2* price. Near the hotel, around 70 meters walk, there is a great traditional Italian Restaurant (you have to visit it to have a taste of real Italian food) with the name Hosteria. Do try this too.",,,
Euro_hopper19,273188,"The area around King's Cross and the new St. Pancras International Rail Terminal has never been one of London's more desirable locations. But if you are exhausted coming off a long train ride or need to leave on an early train, this place is safe, clean, and comfortable. If you are carrying heavy suitcases, this is one of the few inexpensive hotels near the station with a lift (elevator). The rooms are plain and some have quirky shapes. But the beds are clean and comfortable, the front desk staff marvelous. Early in the evening, the police and ambulance drivers seem to favor nearby Euston Street, but seem to take other routes at other times of the day. So there will be some street noise, but it should disappear by bedtime. On the banks of the Spree River, next to the Ministry of Interior, is the Abion Hotel. Rooms are spacious, bathrooms immaculate, service excellent. On a summer's eve, there are boats along the river, and a path for walking and biking along the river, and a an anchored river boat serving a glass of wine or a pizza depending on your mood. Although apparently isolated, the hotel sits at the end of a long block with a decent South German fish restaurant and a grocery, open on Saturdays. The only trick is finding the hotel, which is not easy even with the help of internet maps. But many taxi drivers know the place--less than a ten euro ride from the central train station. The hotel is also used to host conferences held by the Ministry of Interior,. Outstanding service consistently merits this hotel 5 stars. Chaotic groups of weary travelers are welcomed, comfortably seated while waiting organized and dispatched to their rooms in minutes. When facing distinct simultaneous demands from tourists, the front desk personnelÃ¢â¬â¢s professional calm makes each supplicant feel that their concerns matter. For us a non-functioning cable box was replaced within 20 minutes, and taxi drivers requested by the front desk appeared in five minutes. Breakfasts are abundant, with both traditional European and Mediterranean foods available. After having stayed at the hotel for five days, the front desk helpfully pointed out that since we were familiar with the tram system, we didnÃ¢â¬â¢t need a more expensive taxiÃ¢â¬âbut could easily reach our destination by tram. At night the hotel is easy to locate by the string of sapphire blue lights near the entrance.","A very nice hotel, good value for money and a great stay. Was great location and room was big enough for the 2 who stayed. Friendly staff and good cooked breakfast to get you on your way. A good stay. I want to express my thanks to the Carlton Hotel Kings Cross for accommodating me on a busy Friday night at 1.30am with a perfectly acceptable single room with ensuite at a good price. I was booked into the Northumberland around the corner but when I saw how awful it was I knew I could not spend the night there no matter what. Nigel the receptionist was extremely kind and helpful. The rooms are basic but comfortable, pleasant decor, TV, tea/coffee facilities, clean well furnished ensuite, good ventilation and sound proofing. Great location. Really can't ask for more for a short break in London. Well, after trawling through lots of reviews for London hotels we came across this one. We booked a triple room for 2 nights. We got there and found it to be very convenient for both Kings cross and st Pancras stations. When we got there we were offered a quieter room in a newly refurbished building a short walk down the road, approx 50 yards. Room number 6 The room was very clean as you would expect a newly refurbished room to be. It fitted our purpose, it was clean and reasonably spacious with TV and drink making facilities. The shower was good, and all in all the room was an 8/10. The only issue i had with the room, was that the wardrobe for me was facing the wrong way and looked like it was going to fall over for some reason. The breakfast was included and it was a full English and a help yourself service, so it was a case of fill your self up! We paid Â£290 for the 2 nights for the 3 of us. I would class this as reasonable for a London hotel with the stations so close, and breakfast included. We stayed at Carlton for three nights. For the price we payed we didn't expect much, so it was nice to see that the room was clean (and cleaned every day) and in a room for 3 people there actually were double bed and a single bed, not just some old sofa bed. The bathroom was small but clean, there wasn't much hot water but we managed. Breakfast was a full english breakfast (buffet), which was ok for the price and kept us going for a long time. The location near King's cross is excellent. Not a luxury hotel, but a nice budget alternative! The area around King's Cross and the new St. Pancras International Rail Terminal has never been one of London's more desirable locations. But if you are exhausted coming off a long train ride or need to leave on an early train, this place is safe, clean, and comfortable.

Early in the evening, the police and ambulance drivers seem to favor nearby Euston Street, but seem to take other routes at other times of the day. So there will be some street noise, but it should disappear by bedtime. we spent the most terrible night in this awful hotel. There was snow outside, it was freezing cold but there was no heating in our room. We asked the night receptionist to try to get it working, but he couldn't, so we spent a sleepless night, wearing our winter coats etc. I emailed the owner when I got back and asked for a refund or part of a refund but they just tried to get out of it. The owners are Italian, and I thought on the whole Italians are very reasonable but they have treated us very shabbily. We stayed at the Carlton Hotel in July 2010. The location of the hotel is most advantageous for travel in and around London. The hotel is literally 1 minute from the KingÃ¢â¬â¢s Cross station. We arrived via the Tube from Heathrow and departed via Eurostar from St. Pancras station which is adjacent to Kings Cross. On the tube we were able to travel to all the attractions we were looking to visit. We paid 80 pounds/night which is a very good price in London. The room was quite basic, but suited our needs. Wireless internet was available. There was no air conditioning in the room and we found it to be quite hot. We resisted opening the window, though, because there was much traffic on the streets at all hours of the night. If possible, maybe request a room that does not face the street. The breakfast was satisfactory. It was a traditional English breakfast . All in all, I would recommend this accommodation based on the price and the location (provided you can stand the absence of air conditioning). After having booked a studio apartment with a great deal of attitude from a Rude Arabic man, who didnÃ¢â¬â¢t seem to know what was available and when and then insisted on me paying for the whole booking in full, I eventually settled on a small deposit after threatening to go to his boss. When I arrived, with my boyfriend, they firstly told me that the studio was with twin beds; I reminded them that we had booked a double and we received black looks from both the Arabic man and his lady assistant. He then said that the studio was not available as check in time was 2pm. When we came back to check in they told us they couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t give us the room as it had bug infestation, in fact they said they had to vacate the whole hotel because of the bug infestation. They offered no alternative but a full refund of the deposit , which we took as we saw guest arrive and leave. The Bug story was clearly a lie and they clearly didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want two guys sharing a bed together. We felt horrible at the way we were treated and wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t stay there as a gift, with this kind of Dickensian prejudice. Brilliant location,friendly and helpful staff.Room basic but clean,would definately stay there again.My friend and me had a fab 3 nights stay here.Kings Cross just across the road made getting about so easy. 1. the bathroom was too small 2. room was too small 3. the lamp shade had loads of stains on it, the blankets on the beds were very thin, the beds were past it, the furniture was falling apart with handles missing on drawers. 4. very very noisy 5. It's very expensive for what it is, this place is only small step up from staying in a hostel 6. Breakfast: eggs&ham - i must wait for free table (haha) Liked: The best thing about this one was its location directly across from King's Cross RR Station. Liked: They held our bags until it was time to catch the bous to airport Worst hotel (hostel) in my life Room 1 An absolute nightmare, from listening to the toilet system fill up to the rattling door to the window that does not close due to broken bits then added to that was the continous outside noise. I felt like i was part of crime theft auto. The general cleanliness was good however the bathroom was to small and i bumped my head,on the shelf brushing my teeth and the shower would not suit anyone who carries a bit of weight............. Did not try breakfast, overall not somewhere i would stay again despiet being in a good location.",,,
suncoastrider,91577,"After experiencing rude customer service during earlier stays in Memphis at other hotels (including the downtown Marriott), I was a little leery about this visit. I stayed three nights and, without fail, treated professionally and always made to feel at home. It's rare to find staff so courteous across the board. So, hat's off to management. I particularly want to recognize DeLois. She is the epitome of customer service. The location is close to the airport but not in the best of areas. This made dining options either the hotel or a little bit of a drive in truly inclement weather. One other quibble: the televisions need updating. Come on, beautiful hotel, great staff and crappy tvs? All in all, great stay with a few quibbles. Simple touches make this hotel stand out. Friendly check in with a welcoming note from management for starters. A problem with the front gate so they eliminate the nightly parking charge when you know most would still insist on it. Coffee at 5 a.m. when breakfast officially starts at 6. (I've literally had other hotel dim the lights in the lobby until the official breakfast time and refuse to turn them on.). This hotel gets it. Treat people like they're at home. Now, for the big things. The room was clean and the bed comfy. The social hour had decent options and plenty of them. The hotel also is centrally located for restaurants and bars and even has a canal walk running behind the property, which is ideal for a little jog or brisk walk.","We frequent hotels for work and family reasons, as one daughter plays USTA tennis tournaments. This trip was for a college visit to Butler University, very nice school by the way. We have silver or gold in various chains. I do not recall a hotel stay in the last several years where the front desk staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel as a very welcoming feel. I took time out of my busy schedule to email the hotel manager about the nice front desk staff, something I typically do not do. Good location, as I was able to walk to downtown restaurants and shopping, and the hotel was just a 10 to 15 minute drive to Butler. Would definitely stay again. Stayed one night on business. This is a nice hotel near downtown (but still a good walk from all of the main areas of downtown). The canal area is very nice. Rooms were huge and breakfast and evening food and such were top notch. Would definitely stay here again. My only complaint was that the ice cubes continued to be made overnight and spilled over onto the empty freezer deck...which was quite loud. Just a glitch though and nothing to prevent me from staying there again. My stay at the residence Inn On the Canal/January 14,2012 was very nice. The room was wonderful. Only problem I think they over charge for parking $17.00 if we are staying at your facility it should be free and included in the stay We stayed here for two night in January 2012 during a swim meet. Our room had just been renovated and was missing a couple items. The staff was very accomodating to get us the items needed. The staff was very friendly any time we walked through the lobby or needed to speak with them. Hot breakfast with waffles, eggs and more. This is right on the channel so we feed the duck and walked the channel. We will definatly stay here again. I have stayed at this property many times over the last 10 years. It is located on the canal, and is within walking distance of many amenities. You can take a scenic walk, or cab very quickly to any destination in Indianapolis. My favorite part of this hotel is the fact that the people are very friendly, and it is very clean. The price is right, and the breakfast is provided. I would also like to compliment the availability of parking. If you have to park a large vehicle, it is very affordable. I routinely take large and small groups to this hotel. The staff will remember you and treat you like a celebrity. The Residence Inn on the canal in Indianapolis is a hotel which upholds the Marriott standards, please be advised that they will be going through a remodeling starting 11/01/11. The rooms are fine but a bit outdated, have flat screen TVâs and all the necessary kitchen items. The breakfasts (which are included) are very full and family centered. The location on the canal helps make it accessible to several museums and sites. Also it is near the bike and paddle boat rentals. The pool was just the right size and it has a small hot tub. They also have a pool table which was fun to teach my daughter and she could not leave the table. The staff were great, it was late Friday and we had just come from a show (see report on Mind Tripping) I wanted some milk, and the closest convenience store was 8 blocks away, the desk staff went into the kitchen and gave me 2 cartons, no questions asked. Earlier that day, I had to do a conference call for work, and my family took a nap, when I came back in, they were picking out some snacks at the hotel snack shop, the desk staff did not have a local map of the canal area; I had found one on the web and shared it with them, and he gave my family their treats for free (quid pro quo). The only down point was the $17/day parking. The lot is gated and they give you a card to swipe as you go in and out, but $17 is a bit much. The location is great for many sights and touring, donât forget to shop websites for the best prices. My husband and I have stayed at this hotel for the MotoGP weekend in 2010 and 2011. We loved being there and we plan to stay there again. Although the TV's were dated and the electricity went off for a bit longer than we would have expected, we'll forgive them as the staff and overall hotel stay experience was a comfortable one. Breakfast served early in the morning and on our way in from our time out, they would have fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and lemonade available - a nice treat. We sat on the patio overlooking the Canal where the ducks waded and the paddle boat riders, joggers and cyclists would pass by. We walked to the restaurants close by and even ventured off to the downtown area which was very nice. What a shock (and disappointment) to have the Marriott name attached to this property. On the plus side, the staff couldn't be nicer...courteous, accommodating and willing. The rooms, however, left much to be desired. Paper thin walls allowed me to hear the occupants walking above and talking in the room next to ours. Those same thin walls also allowed me to know when they were using the bathroom. Not good!!! Also, when the fan/blower kicked in for the AC, it did so with a bang each time. This is not conducive to a good night's sleep. The kitchen area was hopelessly outdated and made me not want to even use the kitchen. The TVs are not flat screen or hi def. It's hard to go backwards on this when you are used to viewing hi def. The TV in the bedroom was basically impossible to watch. This facility is desperately in need of an upgrade. Shame on the Marriott for even letting it get to such a point. For what I paid for my room, it was a rip-off. First, the front desk staff go out of their way to make an extended stay like being at home away from home. Cherie, Annette, John and Connie greet you personally to make you feel welcome and go out of their way to assure your comfort during your stay. A simple task such as giving extended stay guests a laundry basket ( cost less than $5 ) instead of those unwieldy plastic bags to carry one's dirty clothes to the laundry room make the stay enjoyable. Second, the hotel is on a canal. Joggers, walkers, bikers etc can be seen every day and in better weather you will see paddle wheel boats, kayaks and an occasional gondola on the water. 2 seater and 4 seater bikes are available in season for rent. A trip around the canal is approx. 3 miles. There are several museums, condos and a college campus for Indiana U and Purdue U on the canal. You are within walking distance of Lucas Oil Stadium, Conseco Fieldhouse, Indiana Repertory Theater and downtown Indy including Circle Center Mall . Free Breakfast is served daily at the hotel and free meals are served several evenings for those too tired to venture out to numerous restaurants also within walking distance.Swimming pool, hot tub and exercise room are also on the premises. I just completed my fourth stay at the hotel and hope to return in the future. Simple touches make this hotel stand out. Friendly check in with a welcoming note from management for starters. A problem with the front gate so they eliminate the nightly parking charge when you know most would still insist on it. Coffee at 5 a.m. when breakfast officially starts at 6. (I've literally had other hotel dim the lights in the lobby until the official breakfast time and refuse to turn them on.). This hotel gets it. Treat people like they're at home. Now, for the big things. The room was clean and the bed comfy. The social hour had decent options and plenty of them. The hotel also is centrally located for restaurants and bars and even has a canal walk running behind the property, which is ideal for a little jog or brisk walk. Did overnight trip with family to Indy. Very pleased with this Residence Inn. Located right on the canal. Very relaxing view and good amenities such as billiards room, pool, and fitness rooms. Staff was very friendly and even upgraded our room for us! Parking was steep ($17.00) but found space on street to park for free. Definitely plan to stay here again! We had to be in Indy to go to the Indiana University hospital. We had to bring our little dog along with us. The Residence Inn was the most pet friendly hotel we've ever stayed at. The staff were absolutely wonderful, helpful, and supportive. (Thanks Annette and Courtney!) If we're ever back in Indianapolis again, we will definately stay at the hotel again! I stayed at the Residence Inn Indianapolis Downtown on the Canal for two nights in August 2010. My stay was excellent! Check-in was very easy and we even asked for a room change to be closer to a friend who was staying there at the same time. The location is very good, being right on the canal. You can go down to the lower level and walk right out to the sidewalk! It's near the highway so it was easy to get back from excersions around town and in downtown, so there was easy access to the sites and resturants there. Rooms were clean and appointed with needed ammenities. One of the televisions in our room was upgraded to a flat screen and one needed to be. Our friends room didn't have either upgraded so that is something they should work on. Breakfast was declious with lots of variety and the fresh cookies in the afternoon were a great treat!",,,
Nikko63,1158696,"Amazing apart hotel, very convenient for business travelers. You have space to work, dine and sleep. A living room very spacious, 2 lavatories. It is not an hotel, you don't have a valet parking or things like that. It's far from the main leisure places but it's a good place to go if you want to be in Dubai as if you were living in. You have your own flat and you live like a rich expat. The housekeeping did the washing up every day. There is a washing machine. Unfortunatly, the wifi was expensive but you can catch one for free in front of the lifts !!! It is quite noisy every morning for the prayer Good Hotel and good price, but far from all the main things to do in Dubai. The lobby is very nice, we were offered a beverage at the bar inside. The outdoor pool is very close to the hotel. Nevertheless the rooms are made with poor quality materials. The windows and the walls are thin, we can hear the noise from inside the building or outside. The road is noisy. Choose a room at the opposite.","Spacious and good located apartment building, with helpful staff. During my 12 days stays everything from checkin, room cleaning, concierge services to checkout run smoothly. Good (and free) parking options, nice lake and Dubai Marina View, close to Emirates and The Montgomerie golf clubs (10min by car). Some compliances - we need a visa prior to our visit to UAE. I tried to contact hotel by email and by phone (each day), but no answer or swithching phone calls to ""responsible"" but missing person. It tooks 2 weeks to send me an answer with absolutely overpriced offer for visa application. Second (but only small| compliance is about towels - room cleaning service changed them each day, but we receive normal towels only on some days. This is simply an apartment building being managed as a hotel and the management/staff are doing a poor job at it. Although the units are spacious and have good views, yet the staff and the management are not professional and need a lot of training. THREE days with no towels being placed in the room because they are fully booked is an unacceptable excuse for any accommodation service provider regardless of the reason. When the staff was informed, they would simply smile, inform you that there is nothing they can do and promise to find some towels within a couple of hours. Needless to say once you start shouting, the ball rolls and you get the towels. In short, if you prefer value over service, then you may want to consider this hotel yet note that in Dubai, there are a lot of better options at great deals. Just Wow ..... Booked in advance for a 2 night stopover in Dubai for my young girls birthday, and tell you what, can't ask for anything more. Room, staff, food, service ... Excellent. Only problem is location.... will remember to hire car next time... we forked out a lot for taxi to go round. Don't worry about looking for taxi outside, just let the reception know when you want one and it will be there. Don't be fooled by Dubai marina metro station just nearby, you have to figure out how to get there. Which you want be able to as itâs a long walk, you have to get there by taxi and some of them won't like the short fare. It was out of question for us with little one to walk that far. Only complaint I have had was they didn't let us check in an hour early but no problem, the guy gave us a very good room instead and we asked for lower floors as we had children and there it was the on the third floor. Overall, just get the transport sorted and this the hotel you won't regret going for. We enjoyed out stay there, it is well services and prices are very reasonable for a two bedroom apartment...

I stayed there for 4 days and everynight after Dubai tour I felt really relax inside the Liwa heights, Balcony, well equipped kitchen, always on time room cleaning, no city voice, also relaxing sitting room even for 4 people. It is really very easy to reach the taxi there and 15 minutes to Burj Khalifa by taxi, The staff knows English well and helps all your needs on time.

The apt is fully equipped with stainless steel appliances, pots and pans, crockery and cutlery. The only negatives were the airconditioning/heating units and the elevators were always busy with service workers After getting excited about our supposed New York city view that we had booked and confirmed we were disappointed with a view of neighbouring apartments. Management were not interested in our complaints. As it was just prior to Christmas we has little option but to stay there.Bathroom was small. The apartment smelled constantly of the neighbours cooking. Location was good. Noise of building works from the upper floors during the day. I had a very good stay at this property for two months. The room was spacious, with a very helpful small kitchen and a small bathroom, besides a comfortable bed. Sleep quality was very good, with little noise coming from the street. Sutton Court has a good location, almost on the corner of 57th and 1st. The neighborhood is fine and less crowded than a more central Midtown Manhattan address. There are two supermarkets and some pharmacies nearby, and a wine store right next door. You're gonna find coffee houses and restaurants all around the region. My biggest complaint refers to the distance from the subway. Although being very well located, it was a 10-minute walk to the nearest station. This is not a really bad problem, but keep it in mind if you need to take the train daily and you don't like, don't want or simply can't walk this distance. Obviously you can also take a bus (there's a stop close to the hotel) or a taxi. I would definitely recommend this property. Just come back from a stay here with my husband. The one bed appartment is lovely. It's a 15 minute walk to Central Park and Park Lane. The area is classy and well communicated. There's a good supermarket nearby and some places for dinner although we normally went nearer the center. Loved it My best friend and I stumbled across the Sutton Court website almost by mistake when looking for somewhere to stay in NY; and I have to say that it was the best 'mistake' that could have been made! EVERYTHING from the reservation process with Laysee (she's amazing), to assistance in helping us find the best way to get there from the airport, to the hotels location, staff and (of course) the room blew us away! ""How lucky we were to get a room at the Sutton Court Hotel Residences"" came up regularly in our conversations and I am almost positive that our trip wouldn't have been nearly as great if we had of stayed anywhere else! The hotel is a close walk to Subways and lots of major attractions, the area is clean and safe and there is a grocery store right around the corner which is wonderful when you have the full kitchen in the room. The fact that we had free wi-fi and local AND long-distance calling blew our tops off.... I mean, how many other places can you stay and have free long-distance calling?! Now where do I start with the room... unlike most hotels, the rooms at SCHR look exactly like they do in the website photos! They are huuggee, clean and furnished/decorated almost nicer then my own house! I loved this place and will highly reccommend it to anyone and everyone I know going to NYC... (and hopefully I will be returning again soon myself!!) Sutton Court is fine - that's pretty much as far as I'd go. The location's pretty good for transport - a couple of blocks from the subway and on a good north/south bus route. There aren't many great places to eat nearby, but there's a good food store just around the corner (Food Emporium, on 59th). Service is pretty non-existent - the only people there on weekends are from a security firm - so if you need anything on a weekend, you're out of luck. And even though we had problems during our stay, when we checked out, noone asked how our stay was. The price is pretty good for New York (i.e. jaw-droppingly expensive for anywhere execpt New York!) if you're staying for more than a week. As for the apartment itself, the whole place is a very good size for two people, the kitchen is well equipped for basic needs (although there really are NO provisions, leading to bizarre things like empty salt and pepper shakers), the sofa is comfy, the shower is good (although the bath's tiny), the bed is good quality (soft but not squishy) and the dÃ©cor is nice, if a bit ordinary and uninspiring. Neither of the TVs worked properly and the internet didn't work at all - which made us very cross as high-speed internet was one of the plus points of the apartments. But the worst thing about our stay was the noise. I live in a city. I am used to noise. But 24/7 traffic noise, car horns and sirens, so loud you feel like you're actually sleeping ON the bridge, is just crazy. Even on the 14th floor, we could only sleep with the white noise of the fan, which we turned to high. I suggest you ask for a room at the front of the hotel and on as high a floor as possible, as I guess there would be less noise, but we never saw one of the apartments on that side (we asked to move, but noone who was actually in the hotel on the weekend we arrived had the authority to move us). So basically, if you're staying for a week or more, Sutton Court works out pretty good value for New York and in a pretty good location, but otherwise I'm surprised by the reviews of this place. I stayed here 12/6-12/16 and found the front desk staff very helpful especially with deliveries, laundry, etc. The studio apartment had a kitchenette (very helpful for breakfast in the mornings or breaks during the day). There are a couple of supermarkets walking distance and the location near the bridge was helpful when I had to make trips out of Manhattan. I had a very quiet room so no problems sleeping and a wonderful view of the bridge and the rest of the city. My two adult daughters & I stayed here for a week. The room was large enough to comfortably accommodate the three of us which is not easily found in NYC. The room was spotless & the kitchen was fully equipped. The fact that housekeeping was not included in the rate was not an issue for us. A delightful surprise was that we had free long-distance calling. There was also free broadband internet. The area is quiet but with plenty of restaurants & a nearby groceteria. Two subway lines are 5 to 6 blocks away. Sutton Court provides large rooms with internet connections. The place has a ""spruced up"" look, with contemporary furnishings, but carpets were tired, some installations a bit crude, paint in corridors worn. Seemed like ""Design on A Dime"" didn't finish the project. Staff was excellent. Still, for NYC, the price was great. Kitchen was well equipped. The fitness center is minimal: Lots of good cardio machines, but only one rack of dumbells, max weight 30lbs. Enough for a very basic routine, only....... Sutton Court Residences. What can more can i say but ""perfection"" all wrapped up in a beautiful, clean, spacious fully equiped apartment in an excellent location and staff that are all polite, helpful and always have a smile and a nice word to say to you. I was in NY for 2 weeks and staying at Sutton made my stay 100% enjoyable and stress free, I only wish i booked to stay longer :) I will definately be booking with them again later in the year. Thank you everyone at Sutton Court x",,,
AndyCatChilliwack,568348,"I believe the motel itself is an older one, but every has been spent in keeping it up. It was quiet and comfortable, and we were greeted with a little gift package of chocolate bars when we checked in. We'd picked it because it was about half an hour from Hollywood, where we'd spent the day at Universal Studios and Musso and Frank's wonderful restaurant, and well placed for our trip east the next day. The ""expanded"" continental breakfast was lovely. Don't be put off by the weird cage elevator that you see after you're buzzed in -- use it to go to the hotel reception on the third floor (4th by North American counting) and don't carry your bags up four floors like I did. The room was a tad ... lived-in, but we glimpsed a couple of other rooms and they looked nice and fresh. My son had recommended it and his room was great. It's right on Cavour, and the Colosseum is right down the street. We had a room NOT facing Cavour, so it wasn't very noisy. There's no breakfast room, so you get a modest but very nice Continental breakfast served at whatever time you choose, complete with cappuccino if you prefer. Very nice, helpful staff.

The ""expanded"" continental breakfast was lovely.","It wasn't the worst place I've stayed in but it is still far from the best. Although it's kind of a funny story now so it's hard to be completely negative about the place. Well the huge selling point is the location. It's about a minute up the street from the Forum, 5 minutes from the Colosseum, 5 minutes to the Birthday Cake. Really awesome location. What wasn't good was the place itself. Without explaining too much, I'll just say that seeing the night porter with only a towel around him was not really what I expected. The breakfast is horrendous. I don't know why they bother giving you two croissants that have come out of a packet. They're chewy and really minging. It was difficult to find also. On the main street (Cavour) its the end towards the forum and it's a big brown door with no signage (that I noticed). Then you enter and go in a lift up to the floor that the hotel is on. The room itself was a little small for how much the room cost and the bathroom isn't a separate room, it had walls but was just a raised kind of cubicle area in the corner of the room. The air conditioning was really good though. Looked pretty new. The things I liked about the place were the decor. Was kind of traditional looking. They key into the room was huge so there was sort of an air of authentic tradition. The bed was massive as well which was good after 10 hours walking around Rome. Of course the location was by far the best thing. When I think about it now, being so close to everything we wanted to do by far outweighed a bad breakfast and overpriced room. I don't think I would recommend it though. There's probably nicer places on the same road. stayed here in July with family. Lovely small hotel. very clean and nice large room. Location is fantastic. Colesseum just around the corner. Would stay again. Hotel is only about 5 mins walk from Colloseum metro stop, so location is quite handy. Room wasn't ready when we arrived (about 1pm) but the lady on reception was friendly and let us wait in the lobby. Room was a pleasant surprise, nothing modern but it's classical old, rather than scruffy old. Everywhere seemed clean and the bathroom was a good size. Aircon did not seem to do much, but to be fair we never raised it as an issue and the room was naturally quite cool. Would have given it 4 out of 5 if we hadn't been woken on the second night about 4am, with lots of other guests shouting and laughing. Felt like the staff on Reception should have done more to make them keep the noise down. The advice offered by the staff on Rome was questionable (we were directed to a restaurant that didn't exist and told the wrong number bus route) but everyone was friendly and polite. Overall, I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel if price, cleanliness and location are your main priorities. Don't be put off by the weird cage elevator that you see after you're buzzed in -- use it to go to the hotel reception on the third floor (4th by North American counting) and don't carry your bags up four floors like I did.

As if that wasn't enough, Mon-Thurs evenings there's a complimentary light meal with beverages. The staff was very friendly and made guests feel very welcome. Two outdoor shopping areas (Happy Valley Towne Center and Norterra Shops) with lots of restaurants are located behind the hotel. Since the hotel is next to Interstate 17, there's just a short drive to reach the Anthem Outlet Mall and the Cave Creek area. My overall rating for the hotel would be higher if it weren't for the one night of horror and what might be a practice of putting non-smokers in smoking rooms. We are Hilton Diamond Members and we enjoy staying at the Homewood Suites. This is our second stay at this location. We stayed here for 10 days. The good: The rooms are spacious, clean, and quite. There are many restaurants nearby and Walmart is behind this hotel. The front desk staff are courteous and pleasant. Good internet connection and TV selection. They have DVD's available for free. The breakfast was fair, not a lot of selection compared to other H.S. and the evening meal was ok. The bad: Housekeeping was inconsistent...they would forget dishwasher soap or kitchen towels etc..Overall we enjoyed our stay and would come back to this location. We recently stayed at the Homewood Happy Valley and were very pleased with the staff from the moment we checked in. The grounds were kept up, the room was like new, the breakfast and evening food was just perfect for our stay. This is a little north of Phoenix, but in a new area right off the freeway but not so close you hear the freeway noise. Very new mall next to it but back to back so you can get there easy by going around the block but no mall traffic. Theaters (new) with in a few blocks. For business or pleasure this is a 5 star location. We stayed here to be close to a convention I was attending. The wife loved the pool and being next door to a large shopping center. Should we ever have a reason for staying in this area of Phoenix again, we will surely try to stay here as we really enjoyed it. Hotel employees were friendly & helpful. The room was large, comfortable & clean and even the view was ok. To be crystal clear, this isn't a resort, but is a superb hotel with a great staff. I had a great experience visiting my mom and sister in this Homewood Suites. The staff was friendly and kind. They made you feel like you were a family. The cleanliness was superb. Great place to stay! PROS Stayed for 6 nights. Daily Breakfasts and dinners on Monday â Thursday. Breakfast was scrambles eggs served with a rotating two of the following: bacon, sausages, corn beef hash, and potatoes. There was also the normal cereal, instant oatmeal, bread/toast, yogurt and fruit salad. Made it for 2 dinners, one with raviolis, with choice of red or white sauce. The other dinner was chicken and potatoes. Thereâs also green salad, and some deserts came out later. Wine and Bud Lite from tap is also served. Shopping and restaurants within walking distance behind the hotel. Business office had 3 PCâs each with a black and white laser printer (one was not working). I found this great! Lots of places usually have only one PC and no printer. Great size room, full kitchen, full size refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, plates, and utensils. Thereâs a large flat screen that was on the dresser along the wall in the middle. Situated so that you can swivel it to watch from the couch or turn it so you can watch from the bed. Also in the room was a work desk, a small table you can eat at, and ottoman used as a coffee table. Thereâs WiFi and cable for a direct internet hook up. Room looks just like the pictures in Homewood Suitesâ advertisement. . Except for the WWF bout going on above, the room was quiet with the adjacent rooms. CONS 22 miles from Phoenix if you wanted to do stuff downtown. Exercise room had 2 treadmills and a stair stepper. The only weights were free weights with one bench. Look out, the location was not on my GPS. Just exit North 17 at W Pinnacle Peak Road, the hotel is just a quarter mile on the right. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 30 days while enjoying Spring Training baseball. It was a wonderful stay on all accounts! Throughout our visit, the entire staff made us feel so welcome. We truly felt at home because of their warmth and genuine care. Our room was very spacious and modern. We slept well each night of our stay because of the comfortable bed and quiet nature of the hotel. We also ate very well - from the daily breakfast with many extra touches, to the weekday evening reception which was a full dinner. The dining area and lobby were bright, with high ceilings and a calm, comfortable feel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would strongly recommend this terrific hotel. In fact, we have already made another long-stay reservation for this autumn! We enjoyed everything about this hotel. The food was great and the people were super friendly and helpfull. Great facility, location & staff. Will definitely stay there on any future visits to Phoenix.. This hotel was just north of Phoenix in a nice location. It's close to highways and plenty of restaurants and stores. The staff was friendly and the hotel is in good condition. It was a nice place to stay. Stopped here for 1 night as part of a Phoenix / Palm Springs trip. Changed reservation from another hotel to this one to be closer to Sedona. Looking on google earth before stopping here expected to be in the middle of nowhere. Arrived here at about 2.30 after driving from Palm Springs. First the Garmin took us to the wrong area! Had to use alternative GPS on iphone to get there. Very surprised to see lots of shops / restaurants in this area! The hotel looked very new. Rooms were very clean and bright. Furnishings were excellent. Walked around the surrounding area and ate at the BW3's. Returned to the hotel at about 6pm and had a few of the free beers / wines from the managers reception. The beers were all bottled. Meaning numerous people turned up. Took 4 and went back to their rooms. Had a good nights sleep and left early the next morning for the 90 mile drive to sedona. Overall a very positive experience! I chose the Homewood over the Hampton (which is right next door) simply because of a slightly better price I booked. I was very impressed by the friendly and helpful staff. The room was excellent. It was very spacious and had a good work desk. They had good internet speed, and lots of channels on the TV including several HBOs. I have to give them only a 9.9 out of 10 on the bed, the only 10 around is the famous Hampton Bed in my opinion. My only regret was that I spent too much of my trip away from this room doing things in Phoenix, including attending a DBacks game. I will definitely be staying here in the future.",,,
DCtraveler0009,635243,"I stayed here for one night leading up to the Super Bowl. The hotel is about 25 miles from the airport, which can be a rather expensive taxi ride. It's about 11 - 12 miles from the stadium downtown. The room was spotlessly clean and they provide a safe and there was a mini fridge in the room. However, you can clearly hear TV noise from next door rooms, moderate to low voices in the hallways let alone anything loud, and the heat / AC is rather noisey as well. The location of the hotel is next to a Wal-Mart, near a Kroger, and a few other chain restaurants. It's not in the best part of town. On my way from the airport, when we were about 3 miles from the hotel, we passed a few strip clubs and trailer park areas. I wouldn't want to walk anywhere from the hotel. So aside from having a clean room and friendly service at the front desk, I can't imagine ever coming back due to the noise and location. I stayed here for a few nights around the Super Bowl. The hotel staff clearly went out of their way to provide as much extra help and assistance as they could to make guests feel at home. Service was friendly and excellent. The rooms are standard. Clean, but the water pressure / shower nozzle was not good and made it hard to get conditioner out of my hair. The best feature is the location. It's a block of the main circle downtown. You can easily and safely walk anywhere in the area. There is a Starbucks in the building as well, which is always nice. Breakfast was fine, your standard basic hotel buffet. Plenty of great restaurants are within walking distance, and you can walk to the stadium easily. There is a parking garage at the hotel, which looks as if the ceiling is starting to fall apart. Overall, fine hotel and service. I would stay here again.","This property is conveniently located between the Wal-Mart parking lot and the Goodwill store. The whole place stank of cigarette smoke and some of the male clientele reminded me of the boys my daughter would bring home, hoping to frighten us, her parents. I asked for a non smoking room on the top floor (reserved a week ago) and was summarily given a room on the middle floor. The desk person seemed more interested in chatting with girl than helping. Finally getting a room on the top floor I discovered the room stank of smoke, half the furniture was missing, the other half broken and there was no internet. I grabbed my belongings and told the receptionist, still chatting to his girl, that I would not be staying due to the inability of the hotel to remotely meet my needs. This upset him and he insisted my credit card had already been charged. I told him, in that case, reverse it or I would be. Life is too short to stay in this dump. I told my customer I had moved and they moved a group they had coming in for a conference too. I stayed here for one night leading up to the Super Bowl.

So aside from having a clean room and friendly service at the front desk, I can't imagine ever coming back due to the noise and location. My wife and I stayed two nights at this Comfort Inn location. Before I left, I asked for a fridge in the room, but I guess my note was not received or understood. The clerk told me that it was $10 and wheeled out a fridge from the front desk area. I had to wheel it to the elevator and plug it in myself. Not a complaint but little things like this matter to me and make all the difference to a stay for me. There was mold in the fridge but I didn't want to lug it all the way down again and I was tired. We cleaned it best we could. The rooms were comfortable and very clean, we got a king sized bed. The breakfast is the usual, waffles, cereals, coffee, eggs, bacon, bagels, toast and was always a good stock of items. Front desk staff were nice. The hallways are loud, like most hotels. People can be quite loud and inconsiderate sometimes, especially late at night. It is 5 minutes from Fort Harrison State Park, Walmart can be seen from the room window along with many restaurants. Applebees, Bob Evans, Marcos Pizza, Steak and Shake. There was a pool in the hotel that looked clean but small, looked sized for children. High speed internet is free and quite fast.",,,
jerome347,244041,"I spend there one night because of a late flight, I was supposed to go directly to Olympia when landing, but it was the night already. They had a room for me, and it was a really good night before going to my meeting the day after. Good value for the money. As at Disneyland Paris (see my other reviews) it's always difficult to find a place to stay near Walt Disney World while in business trip because most of the hotels are only for families with kids or not very cheap. Celebration Suites was a pleasant stay (3 nights) for me : close to the airport, free shuttles, free parking and 24-hour front desk. Good value too.

They had a room for me, and it was a really good night before going to my meeting the day after. Good value for the money. Originally I came to seattle on business and stayed at the La Hacienda because of location.Their rooms where 70 a night which was okay but all the rooms havent been remodeled and we stayed in one that smelled of cig smoke really bad. So bad that it stained every article of clothing in my suitcase. I am a smoker and it really bothered me. Decided to try another hotel a wee bit further out in hopes of better conditions so I decided to try this place out. I was very skeptical considering they only charged 50 BUCKS for 2 people. I Paid for only 1 night at first to see how it was. Wow.....was i impressed. While this is a no frills hotel, all rooms have been remodeled tastfully and where REALLY CLEAN.I actually tried to find dirt and found none. It was very quiet(at least on the back side-upperfloor), and I felt totally safe. The staff where cordial enough and tended to my needs.If you are on a budget or if you just want a CLEAN and quiet place for a few nights, this is the place. I HEARD NO AIRPLANES! W00T :) Beds are new also. Pillows kick butt stayed here one night to have access to the airport- was a short drive to return the rental car. everything was fine- clean room, quiet (i had requested a quiet upstairs room in the rear not facing traffic), easy check-in. the interior halls can be noisy but it wasn't problem with my stay. they advertise expanded cable but there were only the usual 20 channels. overall, it was a typical motel6 and good value. The motel was very affordable for the area. It is close to the airport and not too far from the tram (about six blocks) to access downtown. The room was clean and nice for the price. It is in accordance with what one would expect from a Motel 6 .....reasonable prices, few frills, but solid quality. We followed the advice from the desk clerk and stayed in a room towards the back of the motel. Our room was quiet, peaceful and worth the price. It had an ""old motel"" room smell, but a few squirts of air freshner took care of that. The extra 3 dollars for the internet was worth it, as it worked well. We drove from Portland to Seattle for an afternoon Mariners game and had decided to stay one night to 'explore' Seattle. This location was a bit south of everything, but I knew that when I made the reservations. I'd read the reviews on this location, so was a bit leery. At checkin, the clerk suggested a room in the back which she said was quieter. The view was kind of park-like, and there was a picnic table below (next to the garbage enclosed garbage cans). The room was within my expectations, very clean and adequate for the price. There was a bit of an 'old room' smell, but a couple of spritz's of my room spray took that away. We did turn the fan on for a bit of 'grey' noise overnight (again had to use my room spray). My bed was very comfortable, which was nice! Basically if you're expecting the luxury of a $100+ a night motel, dont stay here.. But if you just want a cheap place to spend the night and you do stay here, ask for a room in the back.",,,
Franknap,229419,"The hotel is on the outskirts. The shuttle is a pain and waiting for the bus to where you are shuttles to is ok. Bunch of vendors selling all different stuff. The hotel itself is clean, nice rooms, and great breakfast. Take a walk past the shopping center and go to some of the restaurants, great food. We found a wine shop that sold us a gallon of wine we picked from the vat and poured it into an empty water bottle. Kinda cool! cheap too but good vino! Need to pay for internet but why bother going on vacation if you're surfing the net! Prego! Not bad this place, a bit of a pain getting the bus. But it was cool mingling with the locals. Great shops down the block. Across the street is a nice little pizzeria where you wait for the bus. Dont wait for the bus in the front! It comes on the side of the hotel. Get tickets from front desk(when they have them) or go to the gas station right outside. Breakfast is great but a bit pricey, dinner wasnt bad either. Cheap drinks!","The breakfast was OK, nothing special. The staff on the other hand were helful with bus information and calling us a cab. In terms of price, this hotel was affordale especially during the New Years when I had gone but had I known better I would have spent a bit more and booked a hotel closer to the city center! This hotel is a long long way from the center of the City. Its a long drive from all attractions, airport, railway station etc. Nothing much to choose from inside the hotel too. Breakfast was too simple. This is my new favorite budget friendly brand in Europe! Found this hotel on Expedia and was so impressed with the quality and service I booked an Idea Hotel in Milan later in my business trip! Awesome modern design, great breakfast with lots of options for me and my colleague who dreamed about the Idea Hotel spread the rest of our trip through Europe. Great service and even gave great recommendations for late night food haunts just down the street. Also take note even though it is quite some distance from the city center, they offer a free shuttle to the metro so we were great at making that savings work for us too!! This is a modern well appointed hotel at very very reasonable prices ,it is well connected to the road system and is a business hub hotel and used by coach tour operators for easy access to the road system. Superb breakfast spread but be early if there are two coaches at the hotel ,Rooms are light and airy clean and ample towels soap ,shower gel etc.Nice flat screen ty with sky channels .I am a little puzzle by some back comments made by other travellers this is a really smart place. There is a large supermarket close by for those travelling on a tight budget ,plus it is in an urban area so lots of places to eat ,nice pizza down the street opposite and Carrfour supermarket so it is well serviced.Our trip was on a budget so we used Public transport and walked ATAC the city transport service has a great website with a how to get to route finder easy to use and very helpful.Buses and trams can get quite crowded . The hotel is on the outskirts. The shuttle is a pain and waiting for the bus to where you are shuttles to is ok. Bunch of vendors selling all different stuff. The hotel itself is clean, nice rooms, and great breakfast. Take a walk past the shopping center and go to some of the restaurants, great food. We found a wine shop that sold us a gallon of wine we picked from the vat and poured it into an empty water bottle. Kinda cool! cheap too but good vino! Need to pay for internet but why bother going on vacation if you're surfing the net! Prego! 1.The proximity of this hotel imposes plenty of restrictions because of limited accessibility to its location. One has to be on the shuttle at the latest 1030 to get into town and at 2130 to return to the hotel. Between 1030 and 1845 there is no shuttle service. After these hours, take the public transport 451 to/from Ponte Mammolo metro station. One one occasion we got bumped off the shuttle by the driver as he wanted to accomodate somebody else (guess why??). Not wanting to create a scene on the shuttle and delaying other perople we got off and took up the matter with the receptionist (Emmanuella??) and the hotel manageress who promised to investigate with the driver (not George but the other one). No explanations to date forcing me to surmise their cowardly behaviour! 2. As for the hotel, the rooms were ok - airconditioner hardly having any effect. The cleaners never did a completely satisfactory job. Either they forgot to replace to tea tray or never vaccumed the carpet or omitted to do the bed altogether. We had to get these complaints rectifed via the reception. On 3 occassions the locks refused to open up on swiping the card and once we had to change the room becasue they could not programme the key due to a broken down machine. The mattresses need replacement as most perople we spoke with complained of back aches when we met up in the breakfast area. 3. The reception staff tried to be as helpful as they could especially Daniel went out of the way to make us comfortable. 4. The supermaket and the cafeteria behind the hotel was a boon as we could not find restaurants nearby. Finally, I expected Holiday Inn Express to be forthright about its limitations on shuttle services. I beleive this site is now an Idea hotel using the Holiday Inn Express brand. OK if you are able to speak Italian - Breakfast OK - Staff 50% helpful Beware of the location. The hotel would like you to think it is just a quick shuttle ride to the subway taking you down to city center. What they do not tell you is that there is one (1) 16 person shuttle to serve this hotel and another hotel across the street. You actually do not catch the shuttle at the Holiday Inn Express Rome East. Between the two facilities there are hundreds of occupants. Lines are long for the shuttle and some people are rude, often jumping on the bus without waiting their turn. Tempers can flare. If you miss the last shuttle back at 9:30 PM, good luck. You have to catch the public bus and then walk from the bus stop through less than ideal neighborhoods back to the hotel. If you have the bad luck to miss the closest bus stop and get off ""down"" the bus line, good luck. It took us 2 hours too walk back, and all the policewoman we found could indicate in sign language, no they don't all speak english, was stay together, keep your eyes open, they attack from the dark. I was also amazed that our driver from the airport to the hotel could find it. Rooms were OK and breakfast comparable to other Holiday Inn Express hotels. The positives can not overcome the negatives of the location. The staff we had spoke minimal english.",,,
carlitguy,188299,"We used the SkyTain to go downtown from the airport and it is only about a 100 paces away from the City Centre terminal. We were greeted by the doorman and the front counter check in was quick and friendly. We had a King bed on the 7th floor and it was large and super clean. The bathroom had to be seen as it was very large and spotless. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance and it became a chore to decide which one to eat at. We got a discounted rate and thought they would give us a lousy room. Boy were we wrong! Highly recommend! Used the parking garage as well and the elevator to the lobby was appreciated. They have free internet and printer on the third floor. Definitly will stay here again! Dean in Canada At this price point it is hard to beat this hotel. We stayed here last year and will stay again. You should see what else is out there for this kind of money (under $100) if you shop. Best of all it includes a breakfast with juice, yogurt, milk, teas, coffee, cereal, full fresh fruit, toast, jam sweet breads and jams. Our room was clean and we had a small issue with the thermostat but it was our fault not theirs. They dealt with it promptly. The room was clean and hving developed a very serious medical emergency the front desk staff moved us away farom most of the other guests as I had to spend three days in bed. There is free internet, a pool and newspapers. I look forward to staying here again next trip. The only issue it is not convenient if you don't have a car. It is on a bus route though Dean in Canada","The price was right, the location is convenient, close to downtown, restaurants and shopping. The staff were professional, polite and helpful. The room was clean, modern and very comfortable. I really enjoyed the full size pool and the overall atmosphere was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again! Just needed a staging base for a trip to Calgary. I found the staff at this hotel to be above & beyond the usual Hotel fare. They were honestly concerned with my comfort and went out of their way to make me feel at home. This hotel fit our budget & we intend to use their conference centre. The place just exceeded my expectation. The lobby was great and spacious. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The pool was the highlight of the night as it was huge, and clean. My friends and I had a blast in the pool and Jacuzzi . Breakfast was good (danish, muffins, croissants, cereals, bread and bagels, orange, apples, milk, orange juice, apple juice). They don't have hot breakfast and which is not a big deal for me and my friends. Staff were very friendly and courteous. Requested for a microwave and refrigerator for 1 of the rooms and it was granted. The only negative thing I observed is, the elevator needs updating as there some scratches on the walls of the elevator. Other than that, I will be back again. Booked through Priceline and got a good deal $95.00 for 1 room, parking is $5.00 (includes breakfast for 2, breakfast for child is free as long as sharing room with adult) Note: if you bid your room at Priceline, breakfast is not included. Thank you to all the staff at days hotel. We really enjoyed our stay. My congratulation to the entire staff at Days In, we were delighted with the world class service, beautiful updated rooms, fantastic breakfast package and close to all amenities. As organizers we hosted a group of 30 folk dancers from Europe in October. Our guests were treated like royalty. All concerns and questions were addressed immediately. The fact that they were walking distance to a major mall and a hop step away from the major highways made their stay exceptionaly comfortable. Accommodations were made for the many costumes they brought with them. The staff and management helped me organize much of their travel and made suggestions to items I had not thought of. We now feel that any time we have guests our point of contact will be Days Inn. We did our research with all accommodations in the area, Days Inn surpassed all of them. I was given a tour of the full facilities with an understanding if I wanted to do a conference a banquet a dance or even business meeting, they would accomidate! Thank you! Having stayed at Days Inn for over two weeks I have been very happy with the staff and room. There have been many Hotels over the years that I have stayed in, 4 Star and better but I feel that Days Inn has taken care of my needs as well or better than most. Feel comfortable in staying here on your next trip to Toronto. The room was clean at first glance, then you wonder who has the long black hair? And why in my bathtub? The answer a slow drain. The Tub floor felt like water was in between the acrylic seal and the tub. The white glove treatment would not pass, just to naked eye. A small Continental Breakfast, better bring your favorite snack. Coffee/tea Maker, didn't work.however one cupper, so patience is a virtue! Fitness Centre, Sauna, Swimming pool all not clean, a cold walk from shower to pool that was freezing. And whats with the duct tape on pool? Hotel is ok not as clean as I would like. I was very upset as all ads say there is a restaurant and yet it is shut down! There is no food close to this hotel so at night your stuck unless you have a car or are willing to have delivery from some place! Internet was shoddy and it was a roll of the dice if it worked which made it hard to complete my work. With no room service and not even a place to get a drink to unwind I was very unhappy with this hotel! My room was always clean, and the staff was always accommodating for my full 9 days stay. I stayed in this hotel for 20 days during my business visit to Toronto, Canada. I chose this hotel because this hotel was quite close to my work place. But there is adirect connectivity to downtown via Subway. As a landmark, its very close to Fairview mall (Subway station also) in Toronto. This hotel has a nice indoor swimming pool, free high speed Wi-fi internet facility, microwave for every room and a very nice restaurant Fox and Fiddle in its premise.

Service was great; couldn't ask for more. Daily breakfast was superb; we just loved the croissant. Coffee seemed to have an aroma different from the ordinary brew. Room had enough space to move around. We loved the king-sized bed; lots of room to stretch our tired bodies, considering we flew in from California. Bathroom space is quite limited. Hotel location is very accessible to and from the airport, shopping centers, and Niagara Falls. The trip to Niagara enabled us to view the countryside. Lest we forget, your front desk staff are very friendly, courteous, and accommodating from the very day we checked-in until we check-out . We take off our hats to Frances, and Chris for a job well done. Keep up the good work! Yorkland Hotel is very lucky to have staff like you. This place was so busy at times I just wanted to scream watch your children please. Wasn't so impressed with the room, just looked dirty and the sink was. No blowdryer in the washroom???? Breakfast in the morning was watery coffee bruised apples and picked through pastries. I recommed Tim Hortons around the corner. The alarm was set for 7am and was woken from that. That is something that staff should be checking as they clean the room. I was pissed. This hotel was amazing, total 5 star service and we enjoyed every minute we were there. We had a rough start by staying at another crappy hotel and decided we needed to leave. We booked the yorkland through hotwire and when we got there, we were completly exhausted from not being able to sleep in the other slump so they let us have an early check in and a late check out! We will absolutely be repeats! Thanks again, Lea Horrible smell, stained carpets, dirty everywhere. Rude front desk. They advertise the ""Toronto's new four star Hotel"". It's a joke. Breakfast was free and everything was stale. I didn't like the hotel from the entrance to the exit. To top it off, as I was having breakfast a mouse ran across the cafe. When I told the front desk she was very non responsive...maybe not the first time she's heard it. I dont' mind a simple place but it should have some basic qualities...clean, no smells, good food, nice people, and fresh food....we should have spent a few more dollars in gone somewhere else.",,,
stunew15,185273,"The hotel is in a good location, however all the places on Robson street seem to close fairly early. The hotel were particular with what you cooked which was explained to us when we moved in, however we werent aware how particular the management would be. The cooker in the room didnt have an extractor fan and therefore anything being cooked on the hob, in the oven or in the toaster would set off the smoke alarm on a near daily basis. We were recommended the only way round this would be to open all the windows and switch the air conditioner on full blast, which in mid january is not ideal in your pyjamas! While most of the staff were friendly and helpful, the old woman who works there (although we're not sure as we were told various stories of her role in this hotel by herself) really let this hotel down. On various occasions she was rude and said inappropriate and offensive(at times) statements. One such story was that her husband had died and the manager made her work all the hours he could, however about a week later she then told us that her and her husband ran this hotel as well as the hotel over the road. pretty impressive for a dead person! And another was discussing inappropriate 9/11 views which I found shocking and offensive. Other than this it was a good place to stay for the month we spent in Vancouver. We stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne on the 14th the 15th. It was a clean hotel with lots of character and the room had its own kitchenette which proved useful. The staff on the front desk when we arrived were very useful and gave us plenty of info on the surrounding area and what to see in Seattle. This review would have been a 5 however when we arrived we were asked for a deposit on a credit card of $60 ($30 per night of stay) which we were not informed of when we booked the room. This was supposed to be refunded when we left however nearly a week later this has still yet to be done. Also the website we booked through stated we had breakfast with the room which it didnt, however we think this is a problem with the website as this happened to us at a later stay in Portland. We stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne on the 14th the 15th. It was a clean hotel with lots of character and the room had its own kitchenette which proved useful. The staff on the front desk when we arrived were very useful and gave us plenty of info on the surrounding area and what to see in Seattle. This review would have been a 5 however when we arrived we were asked for a deposit on a credit card of $60 ($30 per night of stay) which we were not informed of when we booked the room.

The hotel was ok, but left a lot to be desired. They were given conflicting information, depending on whom they spoke to at the front desk. Since August 2011, I have been trying to get a refund cheque from the manager Karim. He keeps on saying it is in the mail, but it is November now and I've yet to see it. He does not answer email anymore. I don't know who really runs the place, but they don't do a good job of it. Very disappointing - avoid! There are lots of great places to stay in Vancouver, so skip this one. This place is like Faulty Towers! Avoid at all costs! During our stay somebody working at the hotel took quiet a few transactions from our debit account, despite paying for our stay in cash. When we confronted the manager he blamed the new girls on the front desk, mind you the girls on the desk were the only good thing about this place. After clearing the issue up more money vanished, this time the manager told us it was his computer. This place should be shut down, clearly something illegal is going on! I had stayed here some years back and so, as a last minute booking, it seemed an ok idea. This despite the room charge was an obvious opportunity grab on a long weekend and about 4 times the lowest normal rate. The staff is clingy and not to bright. The room so basic itâs ridiculous. The beds hard as a rock. TV an old, small screen CRT type with limited channels. Lighting from grandmaâs house. I had to unscrew one bulb because the wall light and bed light were on same switch. A kitchenette but all supplies locked up, not even a glass to use. Air-conditioning was an old nosy window shaker and to use it you had to leave open the curtains letting in the street light outside and the view of the neighbouring apartment dwellers across the ally. The bathroom very basic. Cheap toiletries, cheap toilet paper, NO Kleenex tissues anywhere in room. Small thin towels. Exhaust fan that was tied to light switch and made hearing impossible. I could go on but you get the idea. Worth $50 maybe, NOT $250! Then they screwed up my credit card by double billing the security and not communicating to night audit that a cash deposit had been made. Despite a number of pleas and providing the forums to be signed off it took an additional 42 days after staying there to get the credit hold of $328 removed from my card. I have been in the business and usually am pretty forgiving but these operators should be put out of business. Canada Select 3 star rating - what a joke. Will be advising both Canada Select and credit card companies to dump these losers. The hotel is in a good location, however all the places on Robson street seem to close fairly early. The hotel were particular with what you cooked which was explained to us when we moved in, however we werent aware how particular the management would be. The cooker in the room didnt have an extractor fan and therefore anything being cooked on the hob, in the oven or in the toaster would set off the smoke alarm on a near daily basis. We were recommended the only way round this would be to open all the windows and switch the air conditioner on full blast, which in mid january is not ideal in your pyjamas! While most of the staff were friendly and helpful, the old woman who works there (although we're not sure as we were told various stories of her role in this hotel by herself) really let this hotel down. On various occasions she was rude and said inappropriate and offensive(at times) statements. One such story was that her husband had died and the manager made her work all the hours he could, however about a week later she then told us that her and her husband ran this hotel as well as the hotel over the road. pretty impressive for a dead person! And another was discussing inappropriate 9/11 views which I found shocking and offensive. Other than this it was a good place to stay for the month we spent in Vancouver. I have become a permanent fixture for this hotel and, though, I do not get to come out this way very often I always choose to stay at the Robsonstrasse. They have been nothing but amazing to me; the manager and all of the staff. I would not stay in any other hotel now that I've come to know the wonderful staff of this establishment and that's why it pains me to see all these horrible reviews geared towards this nice, but older, hotel. People are so horribly vindictive when they do not get their way and or have been caught with their proverbial pants down. I have felt nothing but safe and secure at the Robsonstrasse for any and all of my previous stays and every time I return they take excellent care of me to the best of their abilities. Now I understand everyone wants a five star treatment, but it is easy to understand that as a boutique styled hotel, that is in no way apart of some massive chain, they are limited in what they CAN do for their guests. However, they always make up for it with their clean, affordable rooms (if a little on the older side), upgrades for return guests (if they so desire) and a friendly atmosphere. Even their new day clerks gave their best in trying to assist me with restaurants to dine at and a few other sights I had not seen or even thought of to check. Like I have mentioned in my other postings to this site; I will always return for a stay at the Robsonstrasse. Thank you so much for, yet another, wonderful stay. Do take care and I hope to be back again. As usual the Robsonstrasse and it's happy staff never disappoint me. My sister and I decided to travel out to the wonderfully green city of Vancouver once again and as is the norm for me now we stayed at the Robsonstrasse. We were greeted with warm smiles from the ever helpful staff who upgraded us to a larger suit (for the same price) just, because I am a return guest. I never get this treatment at any of the other hotels I stay at. If I upgrade at any other hotel I have been charged applicably for it....not much, but still charged none the less. I was pleasantly shocked when I arrived at the hotel this time around as they have apparently given the building a bit of a make-over. A whole new coat of paint (nice and bright) and a brand new sign (time and all included). Not only that, but even the rooms have been renewed and are even better than my last stay. The beds have spring, the appliances are shiny and new and there is now free WiFi! All this and the wonderful staff just added up to a superb stay! I shall return again. They will never be rid of me. :) Possibly the worst hotel in terms of value that I have ever been to. The lobby hadn't been vacuumed in well over a week, there were piles junk everywhere (I have the pictures to prove it) and our two room suite only had one window unit air conditioner. I had to sleep on the floor in the room with the air conditioner because the other room was so hot. I've stayed in better hotels for $50 a night, let alone the $239 they charged us. We left after one night. The Robsonstrasse exceeded my expectations, providing a spacious room, comfortable bed, VERY clean hotel, and excellent location. If you're looking for a boutique-type hotel (and are okay with sacrificing large resort-type amenities), this is probably Vancouver's best option. The staff is very friendly, and they operate with the goal of obtaining guest loyalty. After returning home, I had a question about my bill and emailed the hotel; they returned my message within twenty minutes and we were able to resolve my confusion. The Robsonstrasse is a great deal for travelers, and I will be returning! Hotel cancelled our large group reservation despite having written confirmation. We had sent emails and phoned to verify that everything would be great with our reservations which were made months ahead of time, but when we arrived our reservations had been cancelled. No explanation was offered and staff were completely ignorant. The Hotel manager and booking agents in particular do not help you at all. They didn't offer to help us in any way or compensate us for the problems and said they were now fully booked. I had read the bad reviews but since it was cheap and in a good location, decided to go ahead anyways- Don't! Do not even bother to waste your time despite what any other review or the 'hotel manager' who comments on these reviews says. I always stay at the Robsonstrasse when I'm in Vancouver. It is clean and affordable. They have upgraded me a few times, at no extra charge, because I am a regular customer. It is right on Robson Street, so the location is great. Taxi service is easy to find also. Parking is in a secure place and is watched by video. Your room key is needed to Access the elevator so that makes visitors feel secure. Rooms are air conditioned. As a foreign traveler there, I was impressed they patiently helped me with many problems. I thought it is a nice hotel. It was a good stay and I would stay again. The Staff are helpful and the service good. The room was very nice and the beds comfortable. Excellent location; friendly staff; good housekeeping and good value, and also secure. We enjoyed walking around in Robson street commercial area. If you are taking a cruise this is a great option also because it is just a few minutes away from the ports Nice hotel with nice,clean and comfortable rooms.Really good location.Excellent management.",,,

My 2 kids & I stayed here for 5 days on vacation. The room was clean and suited us well. Customer service was great and I do appreciate good customer service! It was a bit noisy in the back, but I have stayed in worse. Hot water never seemed to run out which is a bonus when there are 3 people in a room. Dennys was right across the street, and the freeway on ramps were very close. Alot of places to eat in the area including an In n Out, Chili's, Red Lobster, and Phil's B-B-Q, old town is close and a neat place to visit, Seaworld is right around the corner too. People criticize the strip clubs being close but you'd never know it by the activity around the place, we never saw anyone around it. I just wonder why it smelled like marijuana smoke in the stairwell and near the other rooms..... I stayed at this hotel twice, one with friends and again with my kids. Though its not the most luxurious it was clean and the rooms are decent, the buffet is great, the kids loved it, the Adventure dome kept the kids busy for a little while and the carnival type games are fun. Didn't care for the cheap circus acts. Within walking distance to the Stratosphere, and if you want to walk the strip and see everything this is a good starting point.

This was the filthiest hotel I had ever seen! From the Cheetos wrapper, mystery stains and stabbing-like rips in the sheets, to towel bars ripped off the walls, rust stains in the bathtub...you name a problem and this hotel had it! Not to mention I did not even get the amenities that were listed on the reservation. When I complained to management they simply said ""sorry you didn't like our hotel."" Yeah, well, I don't enjoy staying in hotels that look like someone was just murdered inside and the staff didn't even bother to clean up. It was embarrassing and horrifying to even have booked this room thinking that management would take enough pride in making sure that the room was CLEAN! Not to mention large, thuggish men were strolling around the parking lot and arguing outside of my room all night. I couldn't sleep at all. TERRIBLE! Good value for short stay. Non-smoking room still smells of smoke. Cigarette burns in comforter. Old and unsafe crib. Not safe for women traveling alone to be outside the hotel at night. We stayed in Room 506. Checked in about 8pm. Bedbugs all over the place. Met 2 women at breakfast who had the same problem. Very noisy on Friday Night The room was clean and the staff friendly. A small breakfast was offered by the hotel and several restaurants and fast food venues are close by. The location is easy to reach by car, bus and Light Rail, with the bus stop being nearly right in front of the door. I would definitely stay there again or recommend it to others travelling to Seattle as alternative to staying in a more central, but also more expensive place.",,,
ladyonfire,98725,"My two best friends and I stayed at the lovely Orleans for 4 nights and 3 days, and honestly, we needed a spatula to pry our butts out of the hotel to go wander the strip, we were having too much fun. I had seen photos of the room courtesy of TripAdvisor, and my friends and I were excited just by those, but when we first walked in to our room, our eyes popped out of our heads! We barely stretched our pockets to pay for the basic room, and ended up getting something bordering on a suite! It was so spacious and comfortable! The overstuffed chair, the couch, and those sinfully comfortable beds were to die for! The linens were clean, smelled quite nice, the bathroom was SPOTLESS (which is really a shocking find in most hotels these days), and there was enough room for the three of us to go about our business without getting in each others' way! The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. That includes the maintenance people, the desk people, and the maids! Man, the maids were SO friendly, and again, is something rare to find in a hotel. Service was prompt, room service was timely, delicious, and the price was more than reasonable. The many restaurants in the hotel were amazing, the movie theater was cozy and comfy, and come on, you can't beat a 24 hour bowling alley! The Casino was fun too, though we didn't spend too much time in there. The various bars in the hotel were awesome, with a brilliant set of bartenders (The Mardi Gras bar was the best!), and the piano bar had an amazing band playing, and they even were kind enough to talk to our group of friends after finishing up their set at 3 a.m. It was the whipped cream topping on an incredible vacation. I've been raving about it since I returned home, and will definitely stay there again the next time I go to Vegas! My friends and I stayed the night on our way to New Orleans, LA for Mardi Gras. It was the halfway point of where we were coming from and where we were going, so we were all pretty exhausted and annoyed with one another by the time we arrived to the hotel (which was a little difficult to get to, being right off of a crazy busy multiple lane, seriously congested freeway with exits on both sides of the freeway *which is strange coming from a place that only has exits on one side*). When we checked in, the girl at the desk seemed a bit bored with the mundane details of her job (i.e. typing my surname into the computer and giving me the hotel key). She barely spoke English, which generally I didn't mind but I had a few questions I needed answering, and she was having a lot of trouble understanding me and vice versa. We got to our room, and was surprised by how clean, sizable, and comfy it was. The beds were stacked with the fluffiest, most delightful pillows, the beds were shockingly well put together, clean, and the sheets were soft. The bathroom was spotless (which is rare in a budget hotel), and everything was in fine working order. The free continental breakfast was surprisingly delicious, there were a ton of options, and everything seemed quite fresh and tasty.

Secondly, I asked why there were no other quests when the more expensive hotel next door was charging twice as much and had only two rooms left on a holiday weekend. Please do not stay here. It is only cheap for a reason. The lobby gives a false sense of reality. It seems classy and a bargin. After paying, I noticed immediately made a mistake. Trash was overflowing from trash cans. Smell of marijuana in the halls. Other terrible oder spread throughout the hotel and rooms. Blood and the hair on the bedsheets. Staff unfriendliest people I have ever meet at a hotel. Terrible terrible experience for someone who has frequented hostels, slept on trains and hundreds of hotels around the world. We were on a budget and decided to go next door and pay twice as much for only a nights stay. Also, I noticed the doors were not locked on the sides.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's not a hotel snob looking for a decently priced hotel that's clean and comfy. This hotel was cheap and the breakfast was ok (I'm not very discriminatory on any food any where). This hotel needed tons of maintenance. Our room entry way light was burned out making our room very dark. The door handle for the closet fell off. The chair to the room desk was broken, the arm rest was nearly falling off. The door adjoining the neighboring room would not lock. Also, the carpet hallway carpet throughout the building was dingy and smelly. The bathrooms were disgustingly dirty and often had no toilet paper. The tables in breakfast dining area were wobbly and the milk smelled sour. One other thing to note, the walls are paper thin. We could hear people talking in the hallway and our neighbors TV even though neither were at unreasonable volumes. Finally, I called down to the front desk to find out when breakfast was served 3 times and no one ever answered. I left a message and it was not returned. Staff had very few suggestions for local, ""off the beaten path"", restaurants or attractions. If you are looking for cheap, suspect cleanliness, and not very good customer service then go hear. This totally served our purpose for this trip. If you are looking for nice, or even just descent, keep looking. The hotel was horrible. The front desk staff was rude and even tried to cheat me out of my quoted rate and tried to over charge me for pocket change. The breakfast was disgusting. The rooms were dirty and smelled terrible. The hallway down on the first floor smelled like ""Marijuana"", the buisness center didn't work because ""there was a virus on the computer"". It was creepy and ugly! The stay at this hotel was a great experience. Front desk, house keeping and all the staffs were very friendly and were very welcoming. The breakfast they have is the best one can get in a hotel and its a nice way to start the day. The rooms were clean, front desk clerk was very helpful and cheerful. Highly recommended. My husband and I decided to take our children to Dallas for the weekend. I looked on a coupon site and found a 49.99 coupon for this hotel. He told me not to expect much for that price, but I wanted to try it out anyway. We got there and were very impressed with the cleanliness of the lobby and the very nice hotel front desk staff. The room was nice and clean and the beds were very comfortable!! Their hotel and spa were clean as well and the kids had a great time swimming. We were looking for a nearby walmart to find some things we had forgotten to pack (like my swimsuit) and the desk clerk was so nice! He even printed out directions for us. The breakfast was hot and great! Eggs, sausage, waffles, homefries, cereal...too much to list! Anytime my family and I travel to Dallas, TX, we will stay at this hotel! Thank you for a wonderful weekend! Stayed here for half a week in October of 2009 and came back for two weeks in March of 2010. Got a good rate for the week long stays. Cleanliness and condition of rooms were fine, not ultra luxury, but on target for the price level of this hotel. Breakfasts were better than average and we always easily found someone to replenish supplies. The group having their breakfast one morning was interesting and did not cause any problems as stated by another reviewer. I would be happy to return to this hotel in future. It is very much centrally located which is great if you need to do things all over the Dallas area. I stayed at the Quality Inn Conference Center for one evening with a large group of approximately 40 people. Minnie, the Sales Director, was extremely helpful and provided a great customer service experience that exceeded expectations. Once I arrived with my large group, the staff on site were also very helpful. The location of the hotel is great, (right off of the LBJ freeway), and the full hot breakfast did not disappoint. I was inclined to stay at the Quality Inn Conference Center because of the ballroom meeting space which I needed for my Friday night conference, as well as the great service I experienced prior to my arrival. After my trip, I am not ashamed to say that Quality Inn certainly did deliver. I would not hesitate to bring my group there again for another stay. And I would definitely recommend staying at the Quality Inn Conference Center for anyone needing a place to stay in the Dallas area. I stayed at this property for a couple days while on business and found it to be a great value and convenient to the city. This hotel was very bizarre. A large site with four wings of hotel, half of which were Quality Inn and half of the same property was La Quinta. The Quality Inn side had the sad quality of an abandoned hotel--dark, smelly, and wierdly decorated. The marquee and the web site promised ""all new rooms"" but my room was stark, the bedspred was stained, the sofa was warn and smelled bad, the coffee table had a big white paint smudge on the top. No ice in the icemaker. Lots of strange young men loitering around talking on cell phones in the hallways, outside the doors (drug dealers? pimps? did not seem like legit business men)",,,
Maria B,618894,"nice rooms, rich breakfast, very cheap , just little noisy We went to the Arizona Grand Resort for a 3 day Spring Break vacation with my 10 year old daughter, a girlfriend, and her 9 year old. The kids had a blast, the moms had a nice relaxing time, with drinks by the pool, workouts, and spa treatments. Came back refreshed and wanting to return! We stayed there from the 9th to the 13th of February during the carnival period. It was very very cold but our room was warm, water was always hot, room was playful and impecable. It had a fabulous mezzanine with a VERY comfortable bed. Overlooking a small canal, it has been tastefully decorated in the venitian style a bit over the top with chandeliers and murano apliques everywhere! The walls are made of silk fabric. We LOVED it! The staff was friendly, the location couldn't be better at a jumping distance from Rialto or St. Marcs. What can I say... value for money. We spoiled ourselves and it was worth it!!! Bottle of Prosecco waiting as we came in the room impressed my husband (I preordered it when I made my booking, it was his birthday) If you have the money GO SPEND IT AT HOTEL CANALETTO!!!! THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! GRAZIE!!!!! Not far from the airport, distant from the city. However is amazing on its quietness, comfort, quality of facilities and of services. Really liked to rest here and walk by foot to the restaurants and shops on the road nearby. I had a reservation made by the travel agency, so I dont know if it was them that choose twin beds for us or the hotel. So when I arrive here I asked to change for a double room and the reception staff offered us an upgrade to a room at the Executive Lounge, wich we pay for half price, it seems. I would be back here. This hotel is right down the street from the Colosseum and the Roman Forum and across the street from Saint Peter of the Chains where the extra large sculpture of Moses by Michelangelo resides. It is a comfortable room with nothing too special - but the price is right - and the food is great! We had Christmas dinner there, and it was a lovely gourmet meal. Close to Saint John's Laterano (Rome's mother church) and Saint Clemens, an historical wonder with three levels, one of which dates back to the 1st century AD and also includes a Mithraic Temple. Stones throw from Piazza Navona - a cab ride away from the Vatican. Walking distance from the Victor Emanuel Memorial - walk up to the higher level in the rear of the building at sunset and see a beautiful skyline. we stayed for 2 nights, great low budget hotel, nice room , the breakfast was full, very clean, the staff very helpful and all the famous monuments in walking distance.. Stayed in Rome for 4 nights. Hotel was better than expected. Good price, great location, clean and even though our room was facing the main road we couldn't hear a thing.

I found the staff to be kind and accomodating. The price was right and the breakfast good. I was amazed that these people bent over backwartds to accomadate the various allergies and difficulties that 30 teens bring with them. We appreciated the location, where our bus could easily pick us up in the mornings or we could walk to some of the best curry sausage joints or to Checkpoint Charlie. If I were a single traveler or older than say 30, I would avoid this pllace if zou have a low tolerance for noise and squealing girls, especially at half term. Other than that it was great fun. You will always get what you pay for. This hostel cost me 36 Euro a night. The room was small had 6 beds in it, but was clean and tidy. It was secure. Even though 6 beds 36 euro offered the whole room. Ideal for a family, or students or even a business traveller coming to the end of the financial year. Car parking is difficult, but I've stayed there three timers and always manged to park on tempelhofer ufer, right outside! Ideally placed for technischer museum, potsdammer platz and 200 yards from Markischer Halles / GleisDriecke. Breakfast is a bit of a free for all is school parties are staying. Well, this is what I get for even trying a hotel(hostel) that was ranked so poorly in Tripadvisor... This place was a dump, with horrible service. It's simply a way to con people out of as much money as possible while maintaining an air of actual (but non-existent) quality. The rooms, while not looking like much from the photos you may see on websites, are all the worse when you see them in real life. The bed was barely adequate with worn linen and parts of it seeming to have permanent stains. To add insult to injury, I left a scarf in the room by accident. When I contacted the hostel to ask if they had found it, they said yes and very helpfully offered to send it for free if I gave an address which was in Berlin. Coincidentally I had a friend who has a house in Berlin so gladly gave them an address. Turns out that they sent the package by DHL courier and charged the expense to the receiver, so my friend had to pay â¬15 to receive a small package which travelled maybe 2 miles !!! When I contacted the hostel about this, I of course received no reply. Don't waste your money! Positive things: Excellent staff, good location, You can easily walk to sights like Check point Charlie.. U-bahn station is also just a short walk.. There is also a direct bus (M41) from Hauptbahnhof that could drop you near this hotel Negative aspects: In terms of comfort of stay, I would say that this hotel performs terribly bad.. We stayed in a 4 bed room in the 5th floor. Through out the night we were disturbed with the sound of U-bahn passing nearby.. So the hotel needs to do something seriously about sound proofing.. Moreover, the curtains were really high and it was really hard even for a person of my height (I'm 5' 11) to move it to cover the windows which in effect made light enter the room throughout the night.. I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you are looking for a damn cheap option of stay in Berlin. The aletto Kreuzberg in Berlin offers a ""what you see is what you get"" feel. This hotel has more of a hostel feel to it, packed with student tour groups from around the world, clearly taking advantage of the value. The aletto's rooms are small and plain but one can't complain too much considering what you pay. The front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations. It is a 5 min walk from one of 2 nearby subway stations which is convenient and about a 10 minute walk from restaurants and shopping. The biggest complaint would have to be certain excessively noisy tour groups, resulting in sub-par sleep quality. I wasn't sure what to expect with this place as had never stayed in hostel type accommodation before but it definitely exceeded expectations. There were 13 of us staying here for 2 nights as part of a stag weekend. When we arrived we checked in with minimum fuss. We had originally booked 4 rooms - 3 rooms of 4 single beds and a single but at reception we were offered a even cheaper option of 3 triples and a room for 4 that had become available. Needless to say we were impressed with the service and the 70 euros we saved were then spent on the first couple of rounds of drinks! The rooms are what you would expect - basic, however are well maintained have separate toilets and showers in each room and the beds were more comfortable than expected. Breakfast was included as well and was a good quality continental breakfast with plenty to eat. Just dont expect a full cooked breakfast if you want that option go and book into somewhere else. There is complimentary tea/coffee in reception and free internet as well. It is also in a good location which is quiet but nice and central with most of the sights within walking distance. Taxis are also very reasonable for when travelling further. Would definitely stay here again for a similar type of holiday. We stayed here for 2 nights, 21 & 22Feb 2010..2 adults & a 4yr old..En suite room with breakfast included was only EUR95!! Excellent location, clean rooms, friendly & helpful staff..2 mins from the nearest subway (Moeckenbruke, not sure of spelling ) , plenty of local resturants close-by..Museum of technology about a 5 min walk..Wish they would have had room for our full stay !! If you are expecting the Ritz you will be let down, if you are expecting a hostel then get ready for a great surprise..!!",,,
EuropeanDiversity,754309,"The former communist regime did a lot to turn East Berlin into an example of their success. At least they tried to. Just before the Wall fell (in 1989), they had started to built a new hotel at one of the most prominent spots â right on the South side of Gendarmenmarkt. Hilton bought the almost finished building site and turned into their flagship venue in Berlin. At least the tried to. The raw material they took over from the socialist planners did not allow for a lot of creative realisation. The hotel has two (terrible) back yards around which many (most?) of the rooms are arranged. The ceilings are too low to make you feel comfortable, and the very American style is quite misplaced (but then, did US chains ever care?). Some years ago, I stayed on the exclusive Executive floor, which did not feel special, and last time they booked me into the newly renovated 5th floor, and again, it felt more like a standard, OK kind-of accommodation. The rooms are too small to make any good impression, and the air condition worked poorly (in the newly renovated room!). Breakfast became quite good over the years, with a lot of freshly made dishes and a super view on Gendarmenmarkt. In any case, the location is the biggest plus of Hilton Berlin. And the staff was also a positive surprise as Berlin is not famous for friendliness or customer-focus, and neither are large hotels. Letâs give it another chance in a year or so, when they will have renovated the conference facilities and the lobby, which currently is terrible 1990s staircases and small fountains, brass and brick (sic). Berlin is a very, very competitive market for hotels, and many of them have unique selling points, ranging from location to style, personalised service or other values. The Sofitel at Gendarmenmarkt has it all, and it continues to be my favourite place to stay in Berlin, and I did stay at quite a few others. The hotel is a former socialist building, which has been completely redesigned and turned into a design temple in the best possible way. Cool entrance and lifts, spectacular gym (in the attic) and unparalleled restaurants (the breakfast room!) and event rooms (the Delphinum is one or Berlinâs best event halls). The rooms are not particularly big, but most have a phenomenal view on the square, and some on the upper floors have small balconies. Cool bathrooms with windows to the actual room, exceptional lighting and cosy beds make your stay extraordinarily enjoyable. When I got to my room, I found a small sweet dish (not just some fruit) on the table â a mousse au chocolat â along with a partly hand-written note. This has been one of the most positive surprises during all my many travels and stays. Also, the check-in and check-out staff was so competent and friendly that it even exceeded the five star expectation. If you like design and service, try my favourite hotel â I will always recommend it and go back. Catholic Spain has come a long way in becoming open-minded and relaxed about many things. But would you expect a regular, more business-focused hotel to decorate each bathroom â the shower actually â with the full-sized (!) silhouette of a naked woman? It is â or least was â the case at the High Tech President Castellana end of 2009. This detail was discussed quite at bit in our international group of business people, and you can imagine how the perspective changes with gender, cultural background, age, sexual orientation or religion! The decoration also was not included inadvertently but as part of a full re-design of the complete hotel in 2005. All rooms, the lobby and the meetings facilities boast a very cool, clean style, and all is good quality. However, the guest rooms are quite small (and a bit dark, even on the upper floors) and breakfast did not leave a strong impression either. Staff is friendly and helpful. The location is good for shopping and some sight-seeing as the hotel sits in a small side street just off Castellana and Serrano. This said, itâs obvious that the location is not so ideal if you want to discover the city or go out partying. The Axel is positioned as an open-minded design hotel in the Eixample district, one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Barcelona. The hotel is very easy to reach (just 3 min from Pl Universitat) and in the surrounding 6 blocks, you will find all kinds of restaurants, shops and everyday life (great mixture). The entrance hall is a cool piece of design, but unfortunately, the staff is a bit pretentious (based on what the place is supposed to offer ...? or why?). On the first floor there is a small business centre, serving its purpose. Most rooms are facing the streets or the crossing. Some are facing a courtyard (would not recommend those although the courtyard is quite cool). The upper floors offer more light, and bit less street noise (as always...). The roof-top terrace is super-cool and among the best in Barcelona (as it overlooks all surrounding buildings). There is a Jaccuzi and a pool up there, and a bar (in the summer). There is a new public gym and spa in the basement, run by the hotel, but guests will still have to pay extra (it was free this month). The Spa is not extraordinary, though. Breakfast is a standard buffet (what a pity) in a design room on the ground floor. Overall recommended place - along with other design hotels in the Eixample or the Raval. Like many hotel chains, AC maintains a good standard in their hotels, which unfortunately also means that individuality is limited, especially when it comes to the rooms. For the AC Barcelona (Forum), the architecture at least is quite interesting as the hotel was build as part of the massive development for the Olympics. It is therefore close to the (new) beach, which it overlooks on the one side, while the city side offers views on the Sagrada Famiglia. The entrance hall and the bar on the first level are specifically interesting and well-designed. Also, there is one floor for the gym and wellness area including an outdoor pool (which could not be used in Feb, of course...). Overall, it's a good hotel and recommended IF you need to stay in the area. For visiting the city, more central places should be preferred. Creative, small, new and centrally located but not at all professional in how the place is run. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s the in-a-nutshell-summary for Pera Art Suites in Instanbul near Galata Tower. The place is a bit difficult to find when you first go there as most maps locate the address wrongly. Once you arrive, the team will be very friendly and helpful. However, when you are in need of some services, it will get difficult. The location is just perfect to explore Galata/Pera but also the metro and trams are just a few minutes away. I recommend this area over the Ã¢â¬Ëold townÃ¢â¬â¢ where you can just go for your sightseeing Ã¢â¬â Galata is the place to go out, have dinner and drinks. Rooms are relatively large and include a kitchenette but without any pots or pans, so you canÃ¢â¬â¢t use it. Breakfast is served in the rooms (upon your call in the morning) and is a sad plate of assorted bites. Furniture and bathroom are all modern and great. The lower the floor, the less light or let alone view you will get (as usual, but here this is even more true). DonÃ¢â¬â¢t expect any service at Pera Suites. I had booked an (overpriced) transfer to the airport which was not there on time. They had required me to pay that in Euro but could not provide change in Euro (bills) so I refused Ã¢â¬â just as they had refused to change back some of my remaining Turkish Lira in Euros. When I cancelled the cab based on all the inappropriate conditions, they starting yelling at me so I left (and would not go back).","Creative, small, new and centrally located but not at all professional in how the place is run.

But when we returned from the coast, we moved across the Galata Bridge and up the hill to a hotel in the New Town, a block from Istiklal Street, in a happening district with lots of interesting restaurants. Hotel: Pera Suites MeÃÅ¸rutiyet Caddesi Orhan Adli Apaydin Sok. No:17/A TepebasÃÂ± 34430 +90 (212) 252 50 50 info@theperasuites.com infoATtheperasuitesDOTcom Ã¢â¬Æ www.theperasuites.com We stayed in a Junior Suite, which is a studio apartment with small kitchen. The price was reasonable and the location excellent with restaurants, bars and clubs and small shops close by (Pera Suites are a block from the famous Pera Palace Hotel if youÃ¢â¬â¢re looking on a map). The area is lively at night and even though the windows are double-paned, there is a hole in each for ventilation, so every word (and shout and late night song) rings clear. It helped to block the vent hole with pillows and to run the air con for white noise. The other challenge at Pera Suites is language (if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t speak Turkish). The staff are very friendly and want to be helpful, but they have limited English and arenÃ¢â¬â¢t able to assist with directions or information or recommendations. But they try their best! We recommend the place, especially if you are noise-tolerant (or are usually out making noise). One blok far from Istiklal street. Good breakfast maybe too tukish with a good selection of cheses. I have spend two nights in Pera Suites, and I was very happy with service and the rooms. Hotel is in excellent location, just few minutes walk from famous Istiklal Street. In this hotel you have the feeling that you are at home, because of the warmness and kind hospitalty that you feel every minute of your stay in this place",,,
JimBeau-n-TX,196257,"Was delighted by the Hotel Arco. I was amazed at how large my room and bath were for the price. The hotel is located on a peaceful, tree-lined street, yet is close to all sorts of nightlife for those who want to partake. The Viktoria-Luise-Platz U-Bahn station is just a short (and pleasant) walk away, which will quickly connect you to other transit routes throughout the city. This old, restored building has a lot of charm, including a courtyard and a beautiful staircase and entrance. The German breakfast was delicious and there was plenty to tide you over until a late lunch or early dinner. Look forward to returning to Amsterdam again and staying at the Freeland. During my visit to Amsterdam, I injured my foot, which required a trip to the hospital. The hotel staff was wonderful, accompanying me to the emergency room and ensuring that I was able to navigate the Dutch medical system (which was superb I might add). Beyond that, the Freeland is convenient, just a block or so from the Leidesplein tram, which will connect you to everything. Breakfast was delicious, with plenty to tide you over until a late lunch or early dinner. I was in Room #8, with a big window that faced out on to Marnixstraat. Loved opening it and getting the nice breeze in the mornings.","Ist not the first time that we book this hotel (9 th) in a quiet street and very nice breakfast buffet. Very helpful staff, room rate includes breakfast every morning. Hotel located just a few blocks from U-bahn station .. My stay at Arco Hotel started with a pleasant surprise since the director, Mr. Osterloh, gave me a double room for the price of the single room booked. I appreciated this nice gesture because the room was not only spacious but also at the end of the corridor. So I enjoyed perfect silence during the night. This room was directed to the inner court full of trees and may be one of the very few hotel rooms in the centre of Berlin where traffic is virtually inaudible. In order not to raise too high expectations I must admit that the house itself is not fully sound-proof. Actually, quite some noise results if somebody flushes the toilet or walks around in the room above. Thus, the silence I experienced was due to a large extent also to the considerate behaviour of the other guests. My room was modern, in best condition and spotless. It was definitely of much higher standard than one would expect in such a moderately priced hotel. The room was equipped with a king-size double bed and a flat screen TV with 16 channels, including BBC and CNN. I would have preferred the mattress and pillow of the bed to be firmer, but this is an issue of personal preferences. Apart from that, my only minor criticism regards the illumination of the desk, which is not really appropriate for reading. Of course, the breakfast buffet of this small hotel cannot compete with that of hotels of hundreds of rooms. However, I did not miss anything and was even offered freshly boiled eggs. On top of all that, Arco Hotel is situated in a nice and calm residential area garnished with some decent restaurants. I may have had particular luck, which cannot be taken for granted. At any rate, I enjoyed a perfect stay and exceptional value for money. Was delighted by the Hotel Arco. I was amazed at how large my room and bath were for the price.

From the first moment we arrived at the hotel the staff were rude and very unhelpful. they had not got our booking so upgraded us to a better room. that night they then wanted to move us back to original room. because they had new booking for the room we were in. Through out the stay the pool was not working at all ! never any expectoration or apology for this. there was a number of ""mice"" seen by the group nothing was ever done about it. A number of the group had items which went missing from their bags during the stay. When asked to see manager he refused to do any thing about it saying that his staff would ""never do some thing like that"" ! Rooms very dirty and need a very good deep clean to make them liveable. Rooms very hot and noise with traffic, The air con did not work ! The internet very slow and over priced ! Never eat in the restaurant as food very Indian orientated and an couple of the group were ill after ! I am regular visitor, but staying here for the first time; Value for money property; always busy so book in advance; great location; Internet should be free, as it is very cheap in DXB; Everything else is fine; B/fast is too Indian Needs lot of improvement to attract more customers as studio rooms are too small. Service very poor. Out of the two lifts available, one lift always found under maintenance. Staff also not properly trained. Swimming pool is there on top 10th floor but that does not attract customers. Passage also very conjusted at reception counter. Over all better find another hotel in Dubai if one needs comfort and luxury at a time. The place had great service. Staff couteous to all inspite of the volumes of people there. The decor was oldish and dated, but the rooms themselves were spacious and clean. I had been there with my in-laws (who are old), and my husband was unable to come along, so it turned out to be a good choice as the staff was great. The breakfast was good, but the selling point for us was the Kamat restaurant right below. My in-laws usually suffer a lot from lack of food alternatives, so this was great. And the food was good to boot, Barjuman was a 10 min away, and the location was not bad, if not great either. Another guest was complaining that the swimming pool on the top floor was dirty, though I cannot confirm this as I wasn't able to go there. There were certain issues such as safe not working (not solved), and delayed room service, but having travelled enough, my husband and I look more at hotels'response to complaints than to the problems themselves. In proactivity, the service came out tops, but they were a little sluggish to react. However, between the general service conditions, the staff, the Indian veg restaurant at the bottom and the breakfast spread, I'd say this is a good place. Date: 16 Feb 2011 to 20th Feb 2011 I was told before I was leaving for India that it is not a five star property and i would not be satisfied with the service. But to my surprise, I had a complete different experience. Upon reaching i was given their big two bedroom suite in place of two separate bedrooms booked for four of us. More than that, the staff were kind and most hospitable. I lost my shopping bags and i received great help from the staff around to help me search one. The breakfast menu and the arrangements made with Kamath were superb. Even my friends and cousins , who did not stay in the hotel, but came to see me , were well attended. Of all this: BIG ROOM, GREAT FOOD and SITUATED AT THE MAIN MARKET MEENA BAZAR makes it all worth a stay in DOLPHIN. Thanks for making our stay pleasant, peaceful and of all Value for Money. Filthy rooms, Unpleasant staff, not helpful at all. Big rat in a room next to gym. Rooftop pool not avalible. Door locked every time we tryed to go there. Breakfast juice served in tiny one-use cups, at what's supposed to be a 3 star hotel. We were only served breakfast the first day even though it was to be included for the entire stay according to our booking. Good location close to Dubai creek and lots of good food. nice location, decent food, easily accessible. near to market area & metro stations...ideal place for people travelling with families...good indain breakfast...pure veg hotel for better for indain travellers..only problem is slow life..rest its ok rooms are big , clean....food is good.....best option for indians even the location is good.....near meena bazar, were lots of shopping can be done I am regular traveler to Dubai UAE i have also stayed in Imperial suites ,York & Ramada they are just pimp hotel service only for that people those who wants single enjoyment But this hotel is strictly a family hotel no nonsense is allowed family can stay for long time and best of all the morning Indian & continental breakfast is free which i like the most because their breakfast is like home made food. The only family hotel left in Bur Dubai. dolphin is a 3 star hotel, its location is good as it is in city area of dubai. meena bazar. please confirm the booking to this hotel before reaching to hotel... location is best , as it is in city, and also its budget hotel",,,
dawoz,248601,"I stayed here recently for one night. The hotel advertised a free shuttle bus to/from the airport. I assumed that the shuttle would constantly be coming around and after 30 minutes of waiting.... I called. The lady on the phone said the shuttle would be there in 8 minutes. 28 minutes later, the shuttle arrived. Not being familiar with the area, I didn't realize that the hotel is practically across the street from the airport. A little too far to walk with luggage, but a cab couldn't cost more than 5.00. If I had to do it again, I would spend the 5 bucks and get an hour of my life back. I try to stay loyal to the Starwood properties and usually am upgraded as I've been a Platinum member for a few years now. No luck here... My room was about as standard as it gets.... although at check in It was noted I was ""upgraded to a higher floor""... WTF? The room itself was ""average"" . Clean and what you would expect from a Sheraton. The room had a very nice flat screen TV, but despite being HD capable, none of my channels were in HD. Kind of a waste. My trip was very short... One day and I spent most of my time away from the hotel. I noticed a bar/pub type place that seemed popular and a very cool salt water fish tank that was HUGE in the lobby. In all, my stay was what I would expect. Nothing special and earns the ""a-OK"" rating from me Although I've been to this hotel several times, usually for drinks or to meet someone, I've only stayed here once. The location is ideal just two blocks from Bourbon Street. The service was great... but I remember the room to be nice, but nothing that really made you go ""OMG"". I'm usually there around New Years and they always have great Xmas decorations... Their public areas are really nice. As with most Ritz properties, they are a bit out of my price range... We splurged one year and it was a nice treat. I'm actually a big fan of the Iberville Suites (Shares the same building). You get all the perks of the Ritz at half the price. After two canceled flights on two different airlines, the airline put us up for the night here. The hotel offered a free shuttle from the airport that was clean and air conditioned. The driver was friendly and showed up a few minutes after calling the hotel. We arrived late at night with 10 or so other passengers who had their flight canceled too. The front lobby staff did a good job in getting everyone checked into their rooms in a short amount of time. Our room was clean and the bed was typical of what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express... Nothing fancy... Low thread count sheets. I found myself on the 4:30AM shuttle that was on time to catch a 6:00 AM flight.... the shuttle was again on time. If you are in the area and looking for a clean place to rest your head for the night, they would be just fine.... I wouldn't pay more than 70 bucks a night here though.... I stayed here for 3 days back in June of 2010. The hotel itself is huge. I believe it is in the 1250 room area, making it quite large... The hotel has tons of meeting rooms, in addition from being just a block away from a large convention center. The location is great. If you are playing tourist like I was, the ""hop on, hop off"" trolley tour stops directly in front of the hotel. The hotel is attached to a large shopping mall that also has a subway stop (Green line). In addition to being close to public transportation, it is walking distance to Fenway Park (20 minutes or so) and there are tons of great restaurants in Back Bay just a few minutes walk away. When going to Back Bay, I found it quicker to cut through the shopping center that is attached rather than walk all the way around... It will save you about 1/4 a mile of walking. There is a full service Starbucks in the HUGE lobby area... in addition to free-wifi and several computer stations set up to use if you don't have your own computer. You can also print boarding passes etc from there. We were upgraded to a very nice suite on the 26th floor that had incredible views of Back Bay, the harbor and of you even see Fenway park. This place is expensive. I think I paid 230+ a night which is expensive for me.... If you are visiting from out of town, don't wast the money on a rental car. They will charge you 40.00 per night to park a car you will never use. You are better off taking a taxi from the airport rather than renting a car. If in Boston, I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. I stayed here recently for one night. The hotel advertised a free shuttle bus to/from the airport.

In all, my stay was what I would expect. Nothing special and earns the ""a-OK"" rating from me I stayed here a week about a year ago for a convention for work. The convention was actually at ""Lowes"" directly across the street, but being loyal to Starwood, I stayed here. Although the location isn't as desirable as the ""W"" French Quarter, it is a much nicer hotel than its French Quarter Counterpart. Nice lobby, a few bars.... Nice place. As an added bonus, it is directly across the street from ""Mothers"" a great place to grab some food when the lines aren't' too long. My first room was ""average"". Nothing special about it... although it did have a nice view of the city. After a few days they upgraded me to a 2 bedroom suite. The Suite didn't have a nice view, but it was still appreciated. At the time, they had some kind of deal going with Lexus and offered free rides within 3 miles of the hotel. I took advantage of that a few times... A nice feature. If you are visiting NOLA and would rather stay at a nicer hotel if you don't mind an extra 5 minute walk, I would recommend the W on Poydras. Location, location location! Located in the 300 block of Chartres, you are really in the heart of the French Quarter. A 2 minute walk to Bourbon Street, it is by FAR the best New Orleans location for any of the Starwood Properties. I have stayed here 4-5 times in the past 3 years. The rooms are on the smaller side of any ""W"" I have ever stayed in. Although the location is not as good, the ""W"" on Poydras has much nicer rooms. Not only are the rooms on the small side, the walls tend to be a bit thin.... and several rooms I have stayed in are close to a rather noisy elevator. The staff is hit or miss. Two years ago, I needed to send something via fed ex. Despite assurances it would go out that day, the front desk didn't get my package to fed ex for two days... resulting in stress and a big headache for me. As a Starwood Platinum, I have been told I've been upgraded, but never to a suite. In fact, I don't know if the hotel even has suites. If your a Starwood Junkie like me, I would book the W French Quarter if you can get a good rate. If not, the Sheraton on Canal has nicer rooms, is usually cheaper.. but the location is not as desirable. The Weston is also a nice choice too... but again, nowhere near as great of a location as the W French Quarter!","First of all, this hotel has changed its name to Comfort Suites. I guess the official change is not going to happen until the end of December 2011. Our first room was right behind the elevator /ice machine. We could hear the ice machine making a swishing sound in our room so we asked for a different room and the front desk made the change and apologized for the inconvenience. We loved the pool and the hot tub. It was easy access to I-240 and anything we wanted to do in Memphis. The continental breakfast met our needs and the staff was outstanding. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. Overall, a really nice stay and we will be using this hotel again in the future. We stayed here the night before our honeymoon to Mexico. We just booked here since it was close to the airport, offered free shuttle to/from airport, and let us keep our car there. The place is gated and lost of lighting. (my wife was paranoid about having her car there for a week). The room was very roomy and clean. The only negative is when we returned to the states it took almost 40min to get a shuttle to pick us back up from the airport. Wow, from the moment my love and I walk into the hotel we rec'd breath-taking great service from the staff. This continue when we asked for much needed direction, heaven sent Director Ms. Cook arrive and assisted us with over & beyoud service. Look I travel a lot with my job & lady of mine and one thing I come not to expect everytime is great service.....Way to go American Way We often stay at Holiday Inn Express hotels but this one is the worst we have ever been to. We are Priority Club members so they upgraded us to a mini-suite with a king bed and single sofa bed for our daughter. After returning from dinner, we found out that you could NOT sit or sleep on the sofa bed. It was so bad that the cushions sunk into the bottom of the sofa. So at 10 pm we went out to our car to get an air mattress so our daughter could sleep on that instead of the sofa bed. Thanksfully we were just staying for one night. What bothered us even more was the next morning when we checked out the front desk clerk asked how things were & when I told her about the unusable sofa bed, she said that they were remodeling & had not done this room yet. Well, why would they give us, one of their Platinum Priority Club members, such a horrible room?? She didn't care on bit.........no offer to give us points, charge less, etc. Needless to say, we were very disillusioned with this Holiday Inn Express. I definitely recommend that you find a differeent place & stay away from this place. We switched our reservation from another hotel to get an indoor pool for our daughter to swim in (thunderstorms outside). What a mistake. The staff is friendly and welcoming but the hotel is in pitiful condition. Our room smells like some kind of cleaning solvent akin to lighter fluid. The internet connection is slow and unreliable. The carpet throughout the property is old, threadbare in many places, and smells of mildew. Baseboards in our room are completely missing with torn drywall underneath. Beds are lumpy and feel over a decade old. I talked to people in the elevator who had similar conditions. From what I can tell this place stays in business because the airlines put people up here whose flights are cancelled. The tall iron fence around the property doesn't do much to lend a welcoming air, nor a sense of security since anyone can drive through the railway crossing styled entry into the parking lot. I plan to let the people at Holiday Inn know that this experience has seriously eroded their brand image with me and I suspect anyone else who has ended up here. We stayed here as part of our Graceland and Beale Street trip. We had 2 rooms. The bathroom fans did not work in either room. Our bathroom fan had not worked in so long that there was rust around the metal door frame. I told the staff about it and they said they would contact maintance. We never heard anything back. I think there must have been mold because there was an unusual odor in our room. The kids room was not so bad. The indoor pool and gym was a nice feature and breakfast was reasonable. I didn't expect a perfect hotel as hotels.com only gives it 2.5 stars. However I expect much more from the Holiday Inn brand. The lobby is nice, however the rooms need work. At first they sent us to a room that was already occupied. When that was fixed we noticed the rooms were not in good shape. The room smelled like mildew. There were missing moldings, the elevator buttons were cobbled up. I had an air mattress in the room which I leaned against the wall for daytime storage and it got wet from water seeping down the wall. Breakfast was to close at 9:30 on Saturday, but when our teens went down for breakfast at 9:15 they were removing the food which was completey gone by 9:20. There were never enough towels. When we asked for towels for the pool the staff told us they were out. But if we used the towels from our room at the pool they would not give us more towels for the shower unless we brought them our used towel. The staff was often rude. Our 19 year old went to use the workout room and was asked her age. When she told the staff she was 19 and a college sophomore they told her she could not use the facility without and adult as they did not believe she was old enough. She needed to go get ID to prove her age for the exercise room. The bathroom in the pool area had a plumbing problem and sewage was coming up from the drain. Also the light in the bathroom did not work. Rather than close the bathroom and call a plumber/electrician, they put toilet paper over the drain. The pool was dirty. You could not see the bottom. The neighborhood was quite rough. There are security gates all around the building and a gate at the entrance to the street. The only thing that kept us from changing hotels is the fact that it was a very busy weekend in Memphis and other hotels were booked. I normally stay at this Holiday Inn about 2-3 times a year. However, upon checking in this time, things were different. I checked into one room and had to move to another room because of the smell in the room and the torn sofa bed. Also, dirty socks had been left in one of the drawer. I was given another room. However the smell was terrible. I asked for something to freshen the room with. The rooms had a dam, musty smell. The bed covers were torn. The water in the pool was murky. The condition of this Holiday Inn was unbelievable. If it had not been so late, i would have checked into another hotel. I asked what had changed in this hotel in the last year, and I was told positions in management. If this hotel is to continue to carry the Holiday Inn's name, changes must be made to correct these problems. After two canceled flights on two different airlines, the airline put us up for the night here. The hotel offered a free shuttle from the airport that was clean and air conditioned. The driver was friendly and showed up a few minutes after calling the hotel. We arrived late at night with 10 or so other passengers who had their flight canceled too. The front lobby staff did a good job in getting everyone checked into their rooms in a short amount of time. Our room was clean and the bed was typical of what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express... Nothing fancy... Low thread count sheets. I found myself on the 4:30AM shuttle that was on time to catch a 6:00 AM flight.... the shuttle was again on time. If you are in the area and looking for a clean place to rest your head for the night, they would be just fine.... I wouldn't pay more than 70 bucks a night here though.... After I checked in and noticed the area (bad) and the high security fence around the property. Not usually a good sign. Another unfortuante problem was a bus load of HS kids took over the hotel with little or no supervision from parents. They wrestled, hung out in the hallway and generally made noise past midnight. For a busienss traveler, that is a problem as I need some sleep. The next morning I had a few itchy spots that I originally attributed to mosquito bites. The strange part was that all the bites were head, arm and waist, nothing below the belt line. I had 50 in all and finally called the hotel to let them know that the bites looked more like bed bugs, from photos I picked up on-line. They called back a few days later telling me that Orkin came in and claimed there was no bed bug activity. She sent me the Orkin report and it shows that the Orkin inspector spent 10 minutes in the room. That doesn't sound like enough time to thoroughly inspect a room suspected of having bed bugs. I only had slept in my own bed the eveninges previous, so the story doesn't really hold water.",,,
Wolfgang S,295165,"Perfect situtated in the french Quarter, where everyday is a saturday night!!! i would like to stay the rest of my days! Its good to hop into the pool, in this hot city. In walking distance is the world famous Bourbon Street, with bars and restaurants and party all the time. A locked parking lot is for an extra fee available.After a little breakfast you are good to go for museums, the ferry to mardi gras center and lots of other things in this most amazing place in the US (world?!?)!! I like to know how Hotels in Turkey earn their stars. The Yavuz has nice public areas, and a reasonably accommodating staff, but thats were it ends. The rooms are small and very outdated. The bathrooms are even smaller and not nice. There is a mini bar and room service, but no place to sit down to eat or drink. The mattresses are rock hard (not firm, hard) and bedding, pillows and towels are old and worn. The location is ok at best. It is in a seedy but apparently safe part of town. The usual tourist attractions are in walking distance if you don't mind climbing a steep hill before getting to the Grand Bazar area. At best this would be a three star hotel, but I have stayed at nicer places with two stars.","Turkish Airlines put us up here in a day room between flights. The room was not available on arrival and breakfast was poor and horrible! and when we got the room, it was stinking of old stale cigarette smoke even though it was a no-smoking room. It was not properly cleaned (former guests underwear in the closet!!!). The room was also tiny and beds uncomfortable. The staff was not friendly and the reception was a bit rude. 4 Stars?, NO: far from it and we would never choose this place to stay. In February Grand Yavuz Hotel is definitively a quiet and great experience. Quiet because there are no noise at all in the neighborhood. Great because the staf is helpful, the accommodation is nice, the breakfast is enjoyable and last but not least, the hotel is so well situated in the Pierre Loti (they write it Piyer...) 'caddesi' or 'street' a 15 mn walk away from the Blue Mosque and from the Aya Sofia Mosque. And the chamber's prices are nice. Because of this all it really earns a good 3 stars mention (not 4).

At best this would be a three star hotel, but I have stayed at nicer places with two stars. great hotel the staff were excellent very friendly and helpful spoke good english the hotel is about half way down hill between Divanyolu cadessi and the coast the marmaris sea, the room we had ''402'' was roomy no squeezing around the bed's the room looked just as in the hotel photos it was comfortable the was bedding changed each day but the room could do with some drawer space as there is only one in the desk and one between the beds.The breakfast was the usual buffet style no problems there, the meal we had in the roof top restraunt was very good,the only real problem was no food or drink was allowed from outside and there was no kettle in the room '' we have small travel kettle for just these occasions'' if you do the same just dont make it obvious what you are doing, if you need tea coffe milk and water there are plenty of small shops and supermarkets within five minuets walk of the hotel.If you dont fancy staying in for a meal in the evening there are some very nice restraunts one or two minutes up hill on Pierre Loti cadessi or you can just as easily walk up to Divanyolu and try any of the many restraunts in nearby Sultanhamnet. just down hill there is a small local park which is very nice in the evening with a very nice bakers close by for fresh bread in the morning if you are going to have a picnic later in the day The hotel staff is quite nasty, it seems that you are annoying them. Medium standard rooms, so not a real 4 stars hotel! They don't do the cleaning up of the room, in fact we used two glasses and they didn't change or wash them, just put them in order. You can't drink or eat in the room, even tough you buy something from the minibar. The position of the hotel is central, but not very accessible. We think that there are many other hotels in better position and, above all, in better conditions! We also tried the Sokullu Pasa Hotel, which is definitely better! Grand Yavuz is in old Istanbul, 1km walk to Grand Bazaar. Hotel very clean, staff efficient but could speak better english. Rooms small but ok. Breakfast ample and included. The hotel rooms are quite small. You can barely move around the three sides of the bed. And if you have more than one trolley for luggage you're going to find it difficult to store your stuff. The bathroom is just large enough for one person to move around. And you get half a bath tub, which is sufficient to move around when you use the shower. But the shower is made with Turks in mind. A tall European or a big American will have difficulties showering comfortably. The hotel is located downhill from the old city. (a 15 min. walk) Not something all the tourist in the hotel were apparently able to cope with. All in all, the price of this hotel is too high for what is offers. You can find better deals in better hotels. Would highly recommend this hotel , it's in a wonderful location and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Istanbul is the most incredible destination and you'd be mad not to go !!! Dear Hussein and all the reception team of grand Yavuz hotel I would like to thank you for the nice hospitality and really it was very nice vacation with my friends from Palestine and morocco Ã¢â¬â Room 501 and 502 since 22/8 till 28/8 . We spent a good time and really it was very nice hotel that very close to the most favor places of Istanbul . Thanks again and really I will plan all my visits to Istanbul at your hotel . Samir Farig HP First of all, this hotel is not a 4 star. It's a solid 3 star hotel. First the pros: good location. You can go up the street and in 5 minutes you'll get to Ãâ¡emberlitas tram satation (and Grand bazar) or you can go in 5-10 minutes walk to main places like the hipodromum, the blue mosque and Hagia Sophia. The rooms are average, no problem with that. Not very big, but confortable and clean. Breakfast was also average. The bad: I didn't like the staff. I wasn't pleasant with the lack of simpathy from them. Every question I asked was always answered without no smile, without no help. We were given a twin room with two beds far away from each other and separated by furniture. I asked if I could change to a double room and I was told to put the beds together myself. So me and my girlfriend had to charge the desk (wich was heavy) to a corner of the room, which for me is not acceptable in a 4 star hotel. But for me that wasn't a big issue. The worst for me was when I asked if they could give me a map. The answer was: ""5 Turkish lira"". I've never been to a hotel which charged for simple map. We declined to pay that money, went to dinner to the restaurant next door, and they gave us a free map. The hotel is good, but they made a bad impression on me. So I think the good reviews are correct but don't expect much from the staff. But it's a good starting point to see Istanbul. And what a great city Istanbul is! I liked this Hotel very much! It was very cleaned, the service, reception and porter were good and ecellent! The only point is the position. It's quite closed to the very city center.... but placed in a distance with a long lift... Breakfast super! Anyway, I would like to come back again and I suggest this hotel to everybody. There is not an italian program on TV. Suggestion: in front of the hotel there is a internet point for only 1 Lira at hour... Weve been to many different hotels in Istanbul , and this was seriously the BEST one we have stayed at . Upon arriving , we were stood outside before checking in , and the staff came out to us and took in our cases for us . Swift check in also , with eletric keys . Upon arriving in our room , we were amazed . The room was MASSIVE , so so clean , had a flat screen TV and the beds were so comfortable . Also there is a shower / bath combination . The shower was so incredible , i never wanted to get out , was so relaxing lol . All the staff were so friendly , really made an effort to make sure our stay was the best experience . At breakfast there is a HUGE selection , ok you have to pay for orange juice , but you do get compimentary tea / coffee . There is a wide range of food at the buffet . Also the hotel has its own roof top restaurant , we didnt eat here but we went to look , and it looked soooo nice . Also there is the health club which does Turkish Bath's . We were going to have one but didnt have time . Prices started from 15 euro . Food and drink is not allowed into the hotel from outside , but trust me , the breakfast makes up for that . The breakfasts were incredible . Also , before going to the hotel , we emailed the hotel to confirm our reservation . They quickly replied confirming our stay and asked if we need transportation to and from the airport . We didnt use the transportation as we already had a taxi booked . Also , we had wifi in our rooms which was GREAT ! OVERALL , a GREAT hotel , just 2 or 3 minutes away from all the sites . Fantastic value , friendly staff , fantastic rooms . CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK ! SERIOUSLY , go and stay here and experience it for yourself , trust me ! We stayed as a group of six couples at the Grand Yavuz for four nights. The hotel is very well managed and has a high level of professionality. I missed fresh fruit at breakfast, but otherwise things were fine.",,,

We need to be in NYC for a weekend for a friend's wedding. I haven't been to NY before, so i took the opportunity to extend my stay for a 4 days long weekend. Since i was travelling with 3 other people, we were all on a tight budget but also needed somewhere safe, clean and convenient. Despite my other friend's discouragement on the location, i booked 3 nights at Sylan Guest house anyway. Julio, own of the apartment was super nice, we arrived 7am friday morning and Julio geneously let us check in early. We checked in at around 8am and were able to have a quick nap and wash up. Subway station was 2 mins away, just around the cornor and train ride to downtown takes around 20-30min. I didn't find the area to be dangerous as described by my other friends, i felt safe walking from subway to the apartment at 1-2am at night.. In general, the place is good, if you don't mind a little bit of commute back and forth, we ended up paying less then those downtown shall hotel sharing bathroom with dozens of strangers on the floor...",,,
Patty L,671168,"This is not very fancy, but perfectly suitable for the beach. Easy beach access, a little further from the honky-tonk area, rooms are fine -- you don't feel too bad walking in w/ sandy feet. I think everyone has a balcony for hanging towels, and there is a nice big pool, as well as tables and umbrellas around. My daughter's soccer team stayed here, and it was fun to hang at the pool after the hot day, order some pizzas and chill out. Our room had a full size fridge, sink, and 2 burner stove - could be convenient if you are staying any length of time. A couple of inexpensive restaurants within walking distance. All in all, satisfied - we'd stay here again. We loved the hotel. It was very central (15 minute walk from Central station) and in a much better part of town, in front of a very nice enchanting park, away from the very busy, dirty, and crowded red light district, But close enough to visit it. The rooms were very clean and new. Staff very helpful like my remote control not working properly and being replaced right away or having our luggage safely stored while waiting for check in. The shared bathrooms are very clean and well kept and never busy or engaged given there's 2 per 4 rooms floor. The only downfall is the coffee shop and 2 clubs downstairs which specially during the weekends can be very noisy but not if you are on the 4th floor like we did. Prices are extremely cheap for central Amsterdam and breakfast simple enough but very nice and more than enough.","I will give the good and the bad reviews about our stay. The first morning that the maid came, we asked her to come back after about 20 minutes and she went off on how many rooms she had to clean and asked if we needed it to be cleaned or could she just leave us clean towels. We just took the towels since she seemed to be to busy to come back at a later time. The second morning no maid ever came at all. My husband had to get towels and toilet paper off of a maid cart he saw outside of another room. They also didnt supply coffee for the coffee pot. Every hotel Ive ever stayed at has had coffee packets in the room. The room was a nice size, yet the kitchen is outdated. The cabinants smelled of strong musty wood and the dishes in them had this smell to. There was no stopper for the drain to wash dishes so you had to just wash them under the water as it ran and add dish soap to each thing you washed. There was mold in the bathroom also. When we checked out, the man asked if we needed a receipt and I said no, he then said well this is all I need then as he took our room keys and said have a good day. He never asked how our stay was or anything. (If he had, I wouldve told him about the maid not ever cleaning our room) The staff checking us in though was very nice and helpful with finding our room and giving us parking instructions. They also charge for each adult in the room and they count children over 7 as an adult. Ive never had a hotel do that before. The good things about this motel was the size of the pool. They did have allot of chairs and it was a huge pool. Very nice area to lounge in. The beach is close also. For the most part, it was ok for the price but I doubt we will stay here again in the future. I found the place to be very nice. The room was exceptionally clean. The beds very nice. New AC unit that worked great! 2nd/3rd floor ""Ocean view rooms"" are no charge and a good suggestion. Parking was always available and a very short walk to the beach. Great deli/store right across the street! Staff was very friendly and did accomodate a 1 night stay request. We visited Ocean City for a couple days in late June 2012. The room seemed extremely clean, housekeeping was polite and the location to the beach was great. Parking wasn't a problem and there is a nice large pool. On our last morning there, we woke up to find there was a mouse(attempting to escape a mouse trap) in our room. When we called the front desk, they asked if the trap was ours(It wasn't so it must have been left from the previous guest. I think housekeeping should have noticed). As they took care of the problem, we decided to have breakfast at their diner 'General's Kitchen.' Don't eat there...it was horrible. The menu is overpriced, some of the food seemed re-heated and my boyfriend and I agreed it was probably the worst breakfast we both have ever had...bubble guts for the next 2 days. We recommend if you rent an efficiency, use it. When leaving, the hotel staff did not ask how our stay was. We would have told them it was great if it weren't for the last day. For the shore, this place is pretty good. Super close to the beach, big pool, and close to a couple decent restaurants. The room was clean and parking was not an issue. Beds could have been better and the stairs were steep but def. a good stay. Will stay there again. This is not very fancy, but perfectly suitable for the beach.

Our room had a full size fridge, sink, and 2 burner stove - could be convenient if you are staying any length of time. A couple of inexpensive restaurants within walking distance. All in all, satisfied - we'd stay here again. We stayed here last August. It is affordable, I loved the balconies, and it is very close to the beach. It was decent and clean. The worst part was the uncomfortable beds. We had a terrible time trying to fall asleep and would not stay there again because of the uncomfortable beds. It was decently close to everything and down a somewhat quieter end of OCMD. We took the bus to the boardwalk. The pool was ok but a little shallow for my liking because it only goes up to 5 feet. This is the only place I will stay in ocean city. I have gone to ocean city almost every year of my life, and there have only been 2 times when I have not stayed here, and I hated it. The beachmark will always and forever be my favorite place to stay in ocean city. The staff is always so nice. The maids are very friendly and we always have everything we need in our room. The pool is amazing. It's really big and it's not too hot and not to cold. It's a little cold in the morning, but who cares? It's the morning when the sun hasn't warmed it up yet. The rooms are just like home. The beds are very comfortable and I love it. It's only about a minute walk from the ocean. It's great. To sum it all up, I love everything about this motel. I have never had a bad experience here and I will continue to come here every time I stay in ocean city. I will not stay anywhere else. At the beachmark, I feel at home. 73rd street & coastal highway, is my place<3. The beachmark is a great place to stay for a family on a budget. :) We would recommend it to anyone with small children or even teenages! Not to mention the gererals kitchen is right below for a very affordable breakfast. It's located right on the Costal highway within walking distance to buses, restaurants and the beach. The hotel is Ocean City which is very nice with children. Not having to cross the nusy street. As long as you understand the is truly a no frills place but just a nice efficency with a great pool; you will come back again. The have great rates as well! LOCATION: About 100 steps from the beach. Perfect if you are planning on spending all of your time at the beach. Cannot walk to boardwalk. SLEEPING: 2 Double beds and a sleeper sofa. Slept my family of 6 nicely. Beds were comfortable enough, did not come with enough pillows or sheets for the sofa bed. I discovered this around 11pm, and luckily caught the office worker before they left for the night. I am not sure what we would have done if we came in any later. Not sure if someone stays on site if we were to lose our room key. BATHROOM: Outdated, but sufficient. Had a hairdryer, but no clothesline to hang wet bathing suits from. KITCHENETTE: Came with 4 cup coffee maker (no coffee that I saw), Microwave and two burner stove. Microwave was small, but heated leftovers fine. Full sized refrigerator, which was nice. BALCONY: All of the rooms faced the pool, Big Peckers restaurant, and noisy street. This is the only reason I would not stay here again, and the reason I would not recommend the motel to a friend. ACCESS TO ROOM: Crazy steep steps with random cigarette butts. It was hard to figure out how to get to my room! POOL: Nice size for my 4 kids. 2.5 feet to 5 feet, so no diving. CLEANLINESS: I am not a neat freak, so I was okay. BUT, I did see a dead mouse in the parking lot, as well as dirty drawers in the room. I was also surprised to see the house keeping staff smoking in the hallways. They did shut the pool down for a couple of hours when a child had an accident in the pool. I saw them testing the water, but didn't stick around to see how they treated it. adequate quality room given closeness to the beach. sleeps six but no privacy if non family members are staying with you. large fridge small microwave and two stove top burners with some pots and pans coffee cups and glasses plates and utensils dish cloth and dish towels also a coffee maker. outside shower and foot sprayer. no elevators first set of steps are narrow and steep second set not as bad balcony to entrance of room is narrow back balcony is separated from other room some rooms are adjoining. pool is 2.5 to 5 foot in depth. one bathroom. bring your own beach towels. just steps from the beach. a few places to shop and eat across the street. located on 73rd street. would stay again. We rented a room for a quick weekend get away, it was very enjoyable! The staff was very nice, there was an over abundance of towels (which was nice) and for a weekend trip it was perfect. Not too expensive, close to excellent restaurants...would stay here again in a heart beat.....there is no elevator, but the steps were really not bad at all, we stayed on the 3rd floor and we did not mind it at all. Last year, we had 8 rooms of family at the Beachmark and everyone so enjoyed themselves that my husband and I decided to stay there again even though we were going alone. We again found the Beachmark to be clean and comfortable and love the location. The General's Kitchen serves some of the best breakfasts around at a reasonable price.",,,

Over the years we always stayed in Yountville at our favorite inn, well now we have found the only place we'll be staying at, Inn at Southbridge in St Helena. They make you feel so at home and appreciated. Breakfast is all you'd ever want, room with fireplace, large screen TV, large room and comfy bed with nice thread counts too. Walk out the door and the best spa, life fitness gym is right there with outdoor large heated lap pool. Manager, Marcelle and staff are very knowledgeable about the wine area and wineries to visit. We loved having the village right there in walking distance with many many stores with great shopping. John& Judy , Gainesville We booked this hotel at the last minute for the Sunday of President's weekend. In comparison to all the other hotels available this had the most reasonable rate, but still not cheap. The hotel is very convenient to downtown St. Helena, Tra Vigne and Merryvale vineyards. The room was spacious, had a working fireplace which was very nice, and a small refrigerator. The bathroom was fine, but basic. The room could use some color or artwork. It was very bland. The turn down service provided cookies and two bottles of water, which we appreciated after wine tasting all day. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. This is not the place to stay if you are looking for a hotel with great grounds and lots of amenities. Otherwise it was fine, nothing really bad, but nothing really great either. It was valentines day weekend and a lot of places were sold out or required a two night stay so I picked the Inn at Southbridge. I didn't have very high expectations but it was very nice. Our room was huge and had a fireplace which was a nice tough. The bed was very comfortable. The location is fabulous because you can walk to most of the St. Helena restaurants and it is right across from Gott's Roadside. The breakfast was basic but nice with lots of fresh fruit, yogurt and some pastries. Overall I think it was a great place! I was up with some coworkers for our company retreat in October and was not impressed in the slightest. The service was good but the rooms were certainly not up to par with the price. The furnishings were old and tattered, the tv old (not flat panel or flat screen), and the bathrooms were worst of all - a stark white hospital bathroom with one tiny, metal, airplane sink and no counter space. I have stayed at numerous places in Sonoma/Healdsburg area including Sonoma Mission Inn, Healdsburg Hotel, Kenwood Inn - all luxurious with wonderful service. To be honest, I've stayed at Holiday Inns that were more luxurious than The Inn at Southbridge. Had we paid in the $100 range per night then it would have been fine but this was not the type of hotel I expect when I pay over $400/night. Some good points - the service was good and the pool/fitness center excellent. I will say that they were extremely prompt addressing my concerns/complaints and told me that they were currently upgrading many rooms. However, if they are well aware that the rooms need updating/modifications than they shouldn't charge the luxury prices to begin with. I spent 3 nights at the inn, while my son was recovering from surgery, and was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the experience. The regular king size room was huge, and had a cathedral ceiling, which added to the spacious feeling that was unexpected in a standard king room. It was tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. The bed was super comfortable and the quality of the linens was very high. I appreciated the large bottle of complimentary spring water each morning, and the small bedside bottles of water with the turn down service each evening. The service at this inn was nothing short of amazing. There was nothing the front desk wouldn't do to make your stay more pleasant, and always with a smile. Marcelle helped us with scanning documents, faxing, and even found a charger for our computer! T They keep menus of the local restaurants on hand to help you decide where to have lunch and dinner. Susan's recommendations were excellent. Breakfasts were in a small, lovely room and included freshly baked goods from the local bakery. Be sure to try the English muffins, which were actually a cross between a doughnut and a muffin. The location of this inn is perfect, as it is on Main Street, within a short walking distance of restaurants, boutiques, a pharmacy, nail salon and the spa. No need to drive after having plenty of wine with dinner! I will definitely return - this place felt like home, after just a few days. This is a very pleasant place to stay in Napa. Rooms are comfortable with charming features including fireplace, balcony, vaulted ceilings and more. The location is perfect...walking distance to wineries, shops and restaurants in St Helena. Situated right off of Rt 29 and easy access to Silverado Trail. Staff was very attentive. Full service spa and fitness facility including a heated lap pool and superb staff right next door. This is not what I would call a ""high end, luxury"" hotel. More of a low-key inn with no pretense. We enjoyed our stay and would return without hesitation. We were there two nights. I would not change a thing. The room was always clean and comfortable. We slept 11 hours on the comfortable bed. We will definetly return. Beautiful place!! This Inn was walking distance from downtown - reminded us of being in a European Inn. Amazing!! This is a perfect example of reality not quite living up to hype. The hotel is very nice and located in a beautiful part of California's Napa Valley. The main street is a short walk / drive away and there is an abundance of great restaurants and quaint shops. Moreover, the Culinary Institute of America along with some of the best vineyards are within easy reach. However, the hotel is listed on the Small Luxury Hotels of the World website and so my partner and I were expecting something far more luxuries, far more impressive, and set in a much better environment. This trip was arranged to coincide with my partner's birthday and so I wanted something truly memorable. As a consequence we felt slightly misled and let down by the actual property. Had our expectations been different the actual experience would have been far better. For those looking for convenience and comfort this is the place. For those looking for something truly special I would encourage a wider search. Booked this hotel because it was listed as a Small Leading Hotel of the World, but it felt more like an upscale Marriott. Our expectations were probably a little high, which is why we didn't react that well to the hotel. The room was alright, and the highlight was the wood-burning fireplace in the room. When we return to Napa, we will most likely stay elsewhere. It was clean, and the bed was comfortable, but probably not worth the money. This is a great location right in the middle of Napa Valley Wine Courntry. It was a very hot weekend (Upper 90's) and our room was cool. At night we opened the patio doors which made for pleasant sleeping. We stayed in the room with the single patio door by the fireplace that is pictured in the slide show of the hotel. The chairs were very dirty with torn arms, and ripped backs. This was a pleasant experience but not a value at the $450 per night that you would expect out of a 5 star hotel. We'll try other hotels in the area on furture trips to the wine courntry.. The location is perfect-next to Merryvale winery, and across from a great burger stand, close to shopping in St. Helena. Workout facility was clean and updated. Rooms were clean, large, and had patios and woodburning fireplaces. Breakfast was included. Probably the worst thing was that our room overlooked the parking lot, but if you looked beyond the parking lot, you could see wineries..... birthday getaway for bay area couple - my husband does business with restaurants in the area, so we stay in the Napa and Sonoma area four or five times a year. we hadn't stayed in st. helena for a while and had seen the ads for the inn at southbridge a few times - decided to try it. The good news - great location walkable to restaurants and to downtown st. helena. nice spa on property with lap pool and nice facilities that are gratis to hotel guests. nice beds and linens. The bad news - looks like they ran out of money in constructing the place - ok so i'm fussy but....large cracks in cement sinks and tile floors, floorboards left unfinished; one side of hall finished, the other side not (??), stickers left on light fixtures, fluorescent tubes plainly visible in bathroom where a piece of glass was quite obviously missing, furniture worn and dirty, cheaply finished doors. Wireless internet as advertised not working, cheap bath fixtures and faucets, rough towels in bathroom (overly laundered; time to buy new ones!), breakfast was fresh fruit which was very nice along with yogurt, granola, and cereal and pastries - which was FINE for me, but many would feel shorted if ""breakfast"" is advertised when eggs, etc are not included. I dunno - lobby was fine, the front desk was quite nice and helpful, but the physical plant was lacking. I wanted to like it, but it's just not there yet. Perhaps when the market gets back together someone can buy some new towels and have the furniture cleaned; buy some prints or art for the walls? our view was a parking lot, as were half of the hotels' view...",,,
Charlie B,197450,"Whilst dirty, tiny and definitely not even a 2 star standard, this hotel had the perfect location with many places to eat and perfect walking distance to the Metro. In the room, the floor, walls and curtains were filthy, whilst the bed linen was brand new and clean; not that it was changed every day though. The bathroom was fine apart from the sticky top to the toilet!!! The breakfast was below average with stale croissants and bread - all you get is a croissant, choc au pain and a bread roll with some jam. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Paid Â£120 each for 3 nights, with flights through easy jet and if luckily this was our only saving grace. Wouldn't recommend, I'm sure Paris would offer better! We stayed at the Meriton World Tower in Sydney for three nights. Our apartment was on the 68th floor and the views were incredible (although not of the harbour). The apartment was spacious, open, bright and well equipped. It was smartly decorated and very tidy and well furnished, but nothing really that a 2 year old could damage. We stayed in mid-April which is slightly at the back-end of the season, and found that the price was less than the equivalent of two adjoining hotel rooms elsewhere which, with three children, was the alternative option we had. I would definitely recommend this place, it has a modest pool but it is on the 61st floor and not particularly busy so the kids could splash about without worrying anyone particularly. The views from the pool (floor-to-ceiling windows) at night was also incredible - a nice place to have a swim! There is a supermarket in the adjacent shopping centre and George Street, which has numerous buses to Circular Quay (opera house/bridge/Rocks), was 30 seconds walk away. The reception staff were helpful and accomodating and so, all round, this was an excellent option for Sydney.","The hotel its self is a bit tired, in desperate need or modernization. The rooms were extremely small, bed spreads very worn and generally quite tatty. The mattress was old and tilted to one side and I slept with the sensation of always fall off of the bed. The staff were all very friendly, the breakfast also was very good, although a yogurt and some fresh fruit would have been nice. I would definately return to the area, we found some excellent restaurants here, its was easy to get around on the metro and felt very safe at night time. Whilst dirty, tiny and definitely not even a 2 star standard, this hotel had the perfect location with many places to eat and perfect walking distance to the Metro.

Wouldn't recommend, I'm sure Paris would offer better! Pleasant hotel,not a big room but a clean one,a very small bathroom,nice staff,french breakfast(Bakery products and coffee or tea),small elevator.Not a luxurious hotel but you get what you pay for! This hotel is well placed catch the Train from CDG to Gard du Nord then take Metro to Oberkampf it is just around the corner (8.80 Euros one way) We walked to the Louvre, Champ Elysees and Eifel Tower from here but oyu can alos access by Metro and Bus. Nearby is a small supermarket where you can buy your water and wine etc. Breakfast is basic bread Roll, Croissant and a Pain du Chocolat with Tea or Coffee and OJ. They have a little room in front of kitchen and initally we were put in what appeared to be the luggage room. If you do not have basic French you may struggle with the inital welcome and waht you get. There are numerous restaurants and bars nearby and they offer a Plat du Jour at a reasonable 12.5 Euros on average, go any further afield and it increases. A beer is about 7 Euros with a Glass of Wine about 4 Euros. The room was small but had ensuite, not all do, however worth the extra, we were rather dismayed with the constant attention of the maid trying to get us out of our room to clean on our first day as we arrived late and wished to sleeep, we even got a telephone call from reception asking us when we were going out? Not a way to treat your guests by waking them up so the maid can access your room. There are a number of British type bars and they are priced the same as local unlike in Spain and other countries where the tend to be more expensive. We stayed here for a week. The location is good as it is close to a few train stations which are within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Breakfast gets boring after a while as its the same every morning 2 x croissants and a piece of bread with a different type of jam. It is a family owned hotel and they go out there way to help guests as we arrived late at night to find they didnt have a reservation for us )which was not there fault it was the internet site hotelclub.com) they did put us in another vacant room which is their emergency room and found accommodation for us the follwing morning. They even offered to move our luggage for us so we could go sightseeing. We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and are very pleased with the choice we made. The hotel rooms are quite small, but very clean with perfectly adequate bathroom. Shower is very powerful. Fresh towels and maid service every day. Continental breakfast included in price which consisted of fresh roll, croissant and pan au chocolate, orange juice and pot of tea, coffee or chocolate. Staff were all very pleasant. Hotel is within short walking distance of oberkampf and republique metro stations and many of the sights of paris are within walking distance. Pleasant enough area to stay in. Do try chez imogene on rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud (couple of streets away) for fantastic crepes at a very reasonable price (very small restaurant so may need to book). Beware of 'found a gold ring' trick by immigrants - its not gold - they are conning you. In a 3 day stay they tried it on us 5 times and we saw it done on many others - the police seem to turn a blind eye! I stayed at this hotel for the first time 9 years ago, as a single young woman visiting Paris... this time around I travelled and stayed with my husband and 2 young children. I have enjoyed both my stays. The hotel rates are incredibly low for a hotel within the city centre of Paris (it's not right in the city centre, but there are at least 3 Metro stations within walking distance), the staff are very friendly and attentive and the facilities are adequate for a hotel of its size and category. Breakfast is a typical French petit dejeuner - if you want a cooked breakfast or a buffet, you're staying in the wrong place. But they have a good selection of hot drinks and they are very accommodating to young children.They offer free Wi-Fi in your room which is an added plus. The area seems to be very lively on weekends which would probably be good for young people, but it will disrupt anyone else's sleep. This was the only flaw I could find. If you want basic, inexpensive accommodation to stay in Paris, I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. I have stayed twice now and will definitely do it again. This small hotel is close to the Place de la Republique in the 11e arrondissment about 20 minutes walk from Notre Dame. The rooms are small but very clean with TV and en suite bathroom. The shower was excellent with really hot water. This is a budget city hotel so there are no frills eg no air conditioning which made for a slightly uncomfortable hot Parisian night. The surrounding area isn't quiet either so take ear plugs if you like peace and quiet but it is close to bars.shops, restaurants and a metro station is 5 minutes walk. The reception desk is staffed 24 hours and staff do speak some English. The rate includes breakfast which is the usual juice and croissants but it is plentiful. There is no parking but there is a parking garage about 5 minutes walk away which can be reserved and paid for on-line at Paris Parking Pass. It is cheaper to pay on-line than at the garage. As a base for a tourist visit to Paris where you want to be fairly near the centre but not pay ridiculous prices this hotel is very adequate. The room was comfortable and clean, nice shower with loads of hot water. For some reason the bedding needed changing when we got there but the staff were happy to do this. Bedding, carpet and curtains were old but OK. As others have said, very little soundproofing from the outside world, also other rooms' doors being shut and people in the corridor could be heard clearly, I would recommend ear plugs for a good night's sleep. Breakfast was basic (bread roll, croissant and pain du chocolat) with coffee, tea and orange juice. Staff were happy to refill if asked. Could eat from 7am to 10am. Had to leave key at reception every time we went out, but the hotel reception is staffed 24 hours a day so no problem. This hotel isn't the Ritz, doesn't pretend to be the Ritz and costs less than the Ritz - we chose on price and location. If your holiday needs include a posh hotel, don't stay here. If you're just looking for somewhere to crash for the night after sampling Parisian night life then it is ideal. The room itself was aesthetically hideous. The bathroom door had a patched hole that was unpainted. There was mold on the shower curtain and bathroom walls. The bathroom corners and floors and bathtub were dirty. The bathroom towels were all hand towels - no bath towels. The beds must have beeen at least 10 years old. It was as noisy as if the windows were open because they were so thin and old. There was no art in the lobby or rooms. We had to leave our key at the desk when we came and left like a hostel. The water didn't get hot the first day - only luke warm. The room was so small that you could barely get by the bed to get to the bathroom. An overall unsatisfying experience. There is no way that this hotel was awarded 3 or even 2 stars and if so, I would like to see the credentials of the organization that awarded them! Friendly staff and we liked the funky location but the hotel was funky in a bad way",,,
Michelle L,224222,"Another fantastic stay at the Cavalieri. We have stayed many times now everything is wonderful from the surroundings,to the staff ,to the rooms, to the food ,especially in La Pergola on the 9th floor, the service , the pools and spa and much much more. To stay in this hotel is sheer luxury it should be on everybody's bucket list ! The hotel is severely run down. Light switches pushed into the walls and broken. The bed was awful, someone's laundry was hanging in the hallway. There were five staff members and only two guests in the lobby and it took 15 minutes to check me in because they were talking to each other. The room felt grimy, broken, and the bed/ pillows were not appropriate for someone's home let alone a hotel. We checked out early. The man at the desk was very nice and offered to show us another room. I said okay... He then came back and informed me that we were already in his best room..... Yikes. Spend an extra 25 euros or so and stay somewhere else. Not close to the Spanish Steps as advertised. The pictures on the website look nothing like the hotel. Stayed here at the beginning of September and had a wonderful experience. They put us in a room on the 39th floor which had an amazing view of the strip and the surrounding hills. The beds were amazingly comfortable and very clean. We brought up one issue with the hotel and they sent up a staff person shortly thereafter who took care of it the following day. For the price this is a great hotel to stay at and it is NOT far off the strip. You walk right through the mall to get to the strip. I would definitely stay here again. Casino, entertainment, good restaurants, and a wonderful clean beach hotel at very reasonable prices. We have just returned from our wonderful week @ Azul. This is a gorgeous property with awesome staff ( especially Oscar @ Palmas)! For those who only have complaints, it's too bad that such small issues can cause such bad reviews. We never once had a cold shower..and my husband and I didn't have to shower together. Our concierge Marco was a great help with all information that we requested. The pool is gorgeous and did not need to be heated. If your in the sun and your body temperature is hot...of course the water feels cold, that's the reason to jump in is to cool off!! The only thing that my husband found a bit different is that the Flavors ( buffet) was very small compared what we're used to, but all the food was good. I would return in a heartbeat, the rooms are fantastic, good food, good drinks and great staff. We stayed in Villa 11 on the 1st floor, walkout room which I enjoyed being able to leave the patio door open and be at the pool. If we needed to get to our room, it was right there. Yes, the beach is rocky, but if you studied your environment a bit before booking, this information is easy to obtain. Can't wait to return....Hola!! This was the worst place ever we were new to Dallas doing a job and had the worst experience of our lives. This hotel is infested with roaches, bed bugs and ants. BEWARE! My girlfriends and I came to stay at Parrot Key Resort over the St. Patricks Day weekend and had the most amazing time. The front desk was so very helpful with giving us suggestions of places to eat...which were all really good. The bartender at one of the beautiful pools was so fun and friendly. She made it so much fun to just hang out by the pool all day. Our room, we could not ask for better...it was beautiful and very clean!! We felt like we were staying in a little beach cabin...so cute. We were able to get a taxi very quickily each time we went out just by letting front desk know. It cost us about $10-$12 each way, which was worth it not to have to find a place to park when we left for Duvall. I would rate this hotel a definite 10 on a 1-10 scale. You will not be disappointed for sure! We came for our anniversary/birthday celebrations. Kevin at the front desk was wonderful -- upgraded us to a Bay-view room and sent a bottle of wine to our room to help us celebrate that first night. The rooms are smaller sized, but its a boutique hotel, everything you need is there (and first-rate), and it is across the street from the Ferry Building and close to AT&T park and BART. Give it a go. You won't regret it! We really enjoyed our stay in Istanbul and Armada. First of all the breakfast is great and the view fron the dinning room is fantastic. The people who work in Armada is very helpful. The location of the htl is great and I can recommed this!!! EXCELLENT! If you want to spoil yourself, do stay there! It was our anniversary and one I won't forget. The place beautiful, friendly, great location, close to transport, professional and attention to detail. The buffet breakfast was superb, the rooms were luxurious and comfortable. Another thing that stood out were the staff, I needed to arrange transport and without asking and hesitation the staff printed a timetable for me to review which was exactly what I needed. I had a great time in Madrid and if you choose to stay there, I am sure you won't regret it. For starters, Hospes is located perfectly in Madrid. Its very central and clos to everywhere we wanted to go. Everything else about the hotel was great too, the staff, the food, and the spa. Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling to Madrid","The lobby was nice. The first room I was given was 115. It smelled terrible, the bed had a dirty bedspread and no pillow. There were no towels, no hangers, no phone and the floor was disgusting. I brought the receptionist to my room who apologized profusely, and I was moved to another room 328. It didn't smell as bad and had towels but was still awful. The floor and rug were so horrible I kept my shoes on to walk on it. The wind whistled eerily through the door all night. I couldn't bring myself to shower there. I've stayed at other Suburban Extended Stay hotels and the rooms were cheap and clean and for the most part in good repair. I think this hotel needs to be condemned, Based on other reviews it sounds like they might have some ok rooms but I would never recommend this hotel based on my experience. I was in town for a week for work training and wanted something close by and cheap with a kitchen. This was, had a little kitchen so it was great for what I needed. Gave me convenient place to stay for a low rate. I stayed here last week and got a great weekly rate. It had a full kitchen (fridge, microwave, stove) and free wireless. The bed was comfy and new. I don't understand what kind of room people want if you're only paying $30 something dollars a night? If you want a Hilton or Marriott type room, you have to pay $200 dollars a night! I paid around $200 something for the whole WEEK! Anyway, if you want something super affordable, safe, clean, etc...This is a great choice. If you want to pay $1200 a week but cuter, go someplace else. Hope this helps! This was the worst place ever we were new to Dallas doing a job and had the worst experience of our lives. This hotel is infested with roaches, bed bugs and ants. BEWARE! This is a ghetto hotel. I have not had sleep since the AC was not cooling at all and it is MAY. I slept in 100 degrees room with the AC on the coolest temperature and it was still 100 degrees.. I cannot describe in any words but to say that anyone who reads my experience learns from it. They do not even have a phone in the hotel room. They are saving money on providing accommodations for their customers. They do even have a remote for the TV. Can you believe how these guys treat their customers? READ THIS AND NEVER COME HERE AFTER YOU READ MY MESSAGE!!!",,,
lissea,506155,This hotel is very old and romantic. I loved our room - very spacious and clean. Our window's opened out overlooking a canal. Great AC. Clean bathroom. Nice breakfast. Staff at the front desk were not very friendly - but maybe that is their custom. Location is fairly close to the train station. If you have a lot of luggage you may want to take a water taxi as there are many bridges and the roads are cobblestone. This hotel is located right in the heart of everything in Boston. Walking distance to Fenway Park and to the Aquarium. Lots of restaurants close by. Lovely ambiance. Rooms were large and spacious. Very clean and modern.,"We stayed at the Tiziano with our two teenaged sons in Spring 2010. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this beautiful hotel. Lovely accommodations -- we were traveling on a moderate budget and it was the nicest hotel by far that we stayed at in Italy. A travel company booked our hotels, so we didn't research it much, but we were very satisfied. It apparently was built as a home in the 1500s, was apartments, and then renovated as a hotel about 5 years ago. It's in the Dorsodoro area, so is a bit off the touristy area, but we enjoyed the quiet location and got to see areas that we might not have otherwise. Large windows look over an open area and a small canal. Getting there was a little tricky rolling our suitcases behind us! (We got to use the ""Universal language"" in asking some locals how to get there--we had good directions, but missed a turn and went too far). If you go, download a map and look for detailed directions (""streets"" are often very narrow passageways between buildings). Note: Google maps may not show the exact location of the hotel. Nice friendly service. Delicious breakfast goodies served on fine china. A true Venetian elegance. We found a couple of good restaurants nearby (although most close during the afternoon.) I will add what I tell anyone who goes to Venice -- be sure to visit the Gesuiti church (Santa Maria Assunta). It's not on most of the ""must sees"" but is simply breathtaking. It's clear on the other side of the island near the Fondamente Nuove vaporetto stop (where you get on the water bus to Murano) in northern Cannaregio. It was the last church we visited -- sort of a last minute decision -- and our favorite in Italy! The Hotel Tiziano describes itself as ""close to the train station,"" but it was a bit of a hike (over 6 bridges) with our bags. Still, once we found it, we were delighted. The hotel itself was beautifully restored, on a quiet residential street. The breakfasts were great - better croissants than we had in Paris! The staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful (my husband hurt his knee and we had to buy a cane, and they directed us to a place where we could find one). It was also quite cold when we visited Venice, but the room was snug and warm. Wifi service was good, too. We would definitely recommend the hotel, or use it again if (when) we return to Venice. This hotel is very old and romantic. I loved our room - very spacious and clean. Our window's opened out overlooking a canal. Great AC. Clean bathroom. Nice breakfast. Staff at the front desk were not very friendly - but maybe that is their custom. Location is fairly close to the train station. If you have a lot of luggage you may want to take a water taxi as there are many bridges and the roads are cobblestone. We enjoyed our four night stay at the Hotel Tiziano. Although the hotel is located away from the tourist attractions, we found the five minute walk to the Basilio vaporetto stop enabled us to use our 48 hour pass to visit all areas of Venice. Our room which had a canal view was clean quiet and comfortable.The buffet breakfast of cereals,fruit, yogurt,meat,cheese, bread and cakes set us up for the day. Staff were friendly and welcoming. We will stay at the Tizianio again. We loved Hotel Tiziano. It was such a peaceful location, about 15-20 minutes from the crowds of San Marco, in a residential area. There were several lovely restaurants about five minutes away. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms were larger than expected and the food excellent. I will definitely stay there the next time I'm in Venice. We stayed there for 3 days.. It is a bit far to walk to the st basilio station. We move around by vaportto as we bought a 3 day unlimited passes. We stayed in a 3 room apartment and the apartment is fully equipped with kichenette and so on. We did go to the wet market to get something to cook. We cook a lot as we are from Asia so we really need rice everyday. The breakfast is good. Very silence and quite area as it is away from city centre. We stayed 5 nights in the hotels 3 bedroomed appartment which was excellent as a base to explore Venice either walking or using the vaporetta and far enough away from the crowds to enjoy a peaceful district..It provided modern facilities ideal for self catering. The breakfast in the hotel was wonderful with a varied choice of cereals, yoghurt, fruit juice, breads, fresh fruit, ham and cheese and a delightful selection of cakes. Fresh tea and coffee and the cappucinno made for an ideal start to the day. The staff were always very helpful and polite and most spoke very good English. We tried the hotels restaurant Autorimessa at Piazza Roma which proved to be very good food, with huge portions and good service too at a discounted price for hotel residents. Don't be put off by the location of the restaurant by the bus station. Although there are no immediate opportunities for restaurants in the evening, near the hotel there are plenty to choose from within a 5 minutes walk and there is easy access to the vaporetta from San Basilo. We would definetly return to this hotel. We booked in at the hotel wondering whether we were going too far. We discovered a few things that were a pleasant surprise intstead - the hotel is beautiful, lovely venetian decor in spacious rooms and a staff that goes out of their way in being incredibly helpful. The other wonderful aspect of our trip was that we had decided to 'hotel hop' staying one night in this hotel and another two nights close to San Marco.... if we had a choice, we'd have extended our stay at the Tiziano (or even ventured to another part of venice). We really enjoyed the local, out of the busy square part of venice. And the distances are not much! This hotel was booked by my travel planner and we had no idea what to expect. Suffice to say, we were pleasantly surprised by this place. The front desk was very friendly, efficient, helpful and spoke excellent English. The place was very clean and looked relatively new. It was very cold and snowed in Venice when we were there but whole hotel was nicely heated. I had a nice loft room with a big bathroom and skylight. Free wireless too. We also arranged for a 5am checkout to catch the train and hotel kindly arranged early breakfast for us. Front desk young man helped to load the luggage onto the river taxi in -8C conditions. Place is also quite near the bus terminal and 1st stop for the river bus. Highly recommended. Location - nice hidden gem hotel, but you have to walk about 20 mins from the train station to get there. It's also hidden a quite a maze that is Venice. Forget trying to follow a map unless you buy a very detailed one from one of the nearby stores. Food - good continental breakfast consisting of ham, prosciutto, cheese, yogurt, cereal, fruit, pastries, bread, butter, nutella, jam, milk, juice, and coffee. They prepared breakfast an hour early for us because we had to leave for the airport at 6 in the morning. Wi-fi Internet Connection - it was free and it worked! Service - nice staff. Usually has one person manning the front desk, most of the times it is a student (or college student aged). The manager/owner is there once in awhile. I broke a small table vase of theirs in their dining room, and they charged me 15 euros for it. I found out about the charge after I checked it - they never bothered to notify me ahead of time, which would have been more courteous. After traveling for 3 months in Europe I can say that Hotel Titziano was one of the nicest places we stayed in. With that being said, I think we got special treatment, because we scored one of the new flats that they have and it was amazing. We had three bedrooms a kitchen, a big bathroom and dining room. Great location in the Dosodoro and very nice staff. I'd recommend getting one of the flats in a heartbeat.",,,
WFD0328,2515216,"We stay at the Hotel du Rond Point des Champs Elysees whenever we visit Paris. We love it! The rooms are very nice, the location is fantastic, and the front desk staff is the same now as it was when we first stayed there in 1996! The hotel is one block from the Champs Elysees at the mid point between the Jardin des Tuilleries and the Arc de Triumphe. There are numerous cafes all within one block of the hotel, and the boulangerie/patisserie two doors down sends the wonderful aroma of fresh baked bread past your window in the morning. The hotel offers breakfast but it's expensive. If you want a good and reasonably priced breakfast, go out the front door of the hotel, cross the street and head to the left. There is a great little cafe right there on the corner that has a very good breakfast and the coffee is perfect! Most of the hotel rooms at the Rond-Point are for two but they do have at least one ""family suite"", which has a queen-size bed, a sofa bed that sleeps two, and two bathrooms. They also have two rooms that have a terrace with an incredible view of the eiffel tower. The Champs Elysees is one block away, and for high-end shopping, Avenue Montaigne is just two blocks away on the other side of the Champs Elysees. There you'll find Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, etc. If you're looking for that small French hotel experience convenient to the usual tourist sites, transportation and great shopping, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this hotel. We stay at the Hotel du Rond Point des Champs Elysees whenever we visit Paris. We love it! The rooms are very nice, the location is fantastic, and the front desk staff is the same now as it was when we first stayed there in 1996!

Liked it before, but love it now. Near everything. The place is small, artsy, and has a lot of chracter. If you want the Hilton, this isn't for you. But if you want to enjoy Paris like it is meant to be, this is the place for you. And, if you've heard bad things about the Parisiennes, forget it when you stay here. Everyone at the hotel was helpful and charming. They will appreciate what little French you speak, but all speak excellent English. We took the Metro a couple of times, but mainly enjoyed walking evrywhere. Rooms vary in size. This time we stayed in #80 - one floor up from the last elevator stop so we had stairs even with our huge suitcases. But no one seemed to mind. Our room might have even been the smallest, but it was like living above the city. View of the tower just outside our door, and Paris rooftops from our bed. Meticulously clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was perfect, though there are many little places near to have coffee and pastry in the morning. This quaint, interesting little hotel immediately makes one feel that you are truely in Paris. It's decor speaks of olde world charm; simply elegant without ostentation. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom fabulously spacious. Cleaning of the room was done perfectly every day and fresh, fluffy white towels were awaiting us on our return. The staff were all very cordial, friendly and most accommodating. The breakfasts were lovely, especially because of the setting in the beautifully furnished dining room and the splendid crockery on which it was served. Our five day stay in Paris was made more special because of the 'Hotel du Rond Point' and was a home away from home. It's location, one street below the Champs Elysees, is perfectly situated. It's a peaceful, welcoming place to return to each day. The reception are very nich, except one tall guy. The room is big with a small balcony. I didn't have chance to enjoy their breakfast, so, cannot give any commend about it. In general, it is a nice hotel with best location. Just few minutes walk to the Metro and Champs Elysees. it was very nice and cosy, a wonderful and comfortable double room!",,,
ncpereira,296434,"Nice hotel to stay 3/4 days, big and clean rooms and bathrooms, good braekfast, staff was nice, easy to get cabs to go arrond, bad is to pay intrnet in this days Nice hotel to stay 3/4 days visiting Istanbul, Clean rooms, Good Location, 10 min walk to Grand Bazaar, The breakfast poor but ok,","Nice hotel to stay 3/4 days visiting Istanbul, Clean rooms, Good Location, 10 min walk to Grand Bazaar, The breakfast poor but ok, This middle size hotel seems to attract many American tourists. My friends came from the US joining the tour so we had no choice to stay to maximize our meeting time. We had many things to talk after three years of absence. This hotel served this purpose very well and reasonably priced when my friend booked from their travel agent in LA. But if I were travelling with my family, I will have second thoughts. Good sides are: close tram and not too big but not too small. They have minimum amenities. Down sides are: walls are so thin and sometimes noice was disturbing. Breakfast could be improved. Very turkish and to me I will be happier with not so many cheese but quality bread and coffee. Check the price around and make decision. What you pay is what you get is applied to this hotel. This was a very nice, modern hotel. Rooms were updated and clean. Good selection for the breakfast buffet. Nice neighborhood close to most landmarks. Little difficult to find when we first arrived but a nice base to explore the city. We stayed in Sept 2011. Our expectations werent high so it proved to be a reasonably Ok hotel, The positives: Clean rooms, near tram line, not too far from Grand Bazaar [20 min walk] The Challenges: Hard beds, thin walls and average breakfasts. Notes: You will be woken up by call to prayers passing trucks and or any street level noise. Walking distance to Tram mean you have access to ALL the major old city attractions As you leave the hotel lobby, turn right and right again you will come across a number of local fast food kebap shops. Hotel Service was good as we had no difficulties checking into our room. In addition, the front desk was able to provide answers to every question we had. Room service always ensured rooms were clean. Our room was well positioned and clean with modern furnishments. Room amenities were nice including a comfortable queen sized bed, fast WiFi, and TV. Our Air Conditioner seemed to experience problems during the night which wasnt an issue most of the nights we stayed and the widow door hinge seemed to be broken. Walls tended to be thin so I heard much activity which was occuring in adjacent rooms, no big deal however. Location was ok- we were located about a 5 minute walk away from the main street and the Tram Station. There is always live music in your room at night due to the thin walls and multiple dining facilities immediately outside the hotel that feature live music. This didn't keep me up however as I slept soundly. Summary: + Good Hotel Service, Modern Rooms -Thin walls Although the hotel does not have a sufficient number of non-smoking rooms and is not good for a light sleeper because the walls are thin and music from bands in cafes outside is very loud, I found the staff to be very polite and, in one case, exceptionally kind. When a member of our tour group became sick, a hotel employee walked him to a nearby health facility and spent half the day there translating and making sure he received good care. She even refused to take the tip she was offered for her helpfulness. My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights last summer and we were happy with the hotel. It is a reasonably priced hotel that one can walk to the bazaar in 15-20 minutes. The rooms were clean and the staff was modestly pleasant. It had an elevator and internet access, but I am not sure if it was free or not. I never used it. Restaurant and breakfast were good, no complaints there. I would stay here again. i was in Istanbul for 11 nights in this hotel with friend of mine . this hotel is perfect and worth more than the price paid. clean and comfortable.it just 2 min walking down to Tram way and the staff was very polite and helpfull-they gave us directions ,prices for many of our destinations and working days and makes our stay memorable.the room was Istanbul standard - i mean quite small but this is the standard in all Istanbul hotels but it was fine since we are in the hotel just for sleeping-the bathroom was very very very clean, perfect daily room service-housekeeping- with no extra charge.50 lira or 20 dollar deposit-returnable- if you want to use safe box located in the room which i recommend. grocery shop is nearby-in front of the hotel- from which you can do some shopping fro water and snakes which were allowed to bring inside the hotel not like some other hotel. for all theses i would recommend staying in this hotel and you would not regret it. We stayed here a three ""winter"" nigths in the double room. We selected this hotel, because they promised the free dinner, and welcome coctail of the first night, if we stay here 3 nights, and a free fitness, swimming pool, etc. But we did not get anything, vainly I showed the reservation. In the reception said, that the sauna is a free, but the the entrance to the sauna we had to pay the more money, than was the price of the room! This is a outrageous. Before the chek in they take off the money from my account. ( We didn't starts from our country) They are not fair, and think that we are too. The hotel is modern, and a rooms is comfortable, and clean. The walls is very slim, therefore the room is noisy. The breakfast is appropriate, right, but not standard europian. We stayed for 2 weeks. We found the hotel lived up to our expectations and more. Staff, especially Lezume, Mert and Bilgin were very helpful, friendly and professional. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Hotel was very quiet and outdoor pool, although small, wasn't busy except for Sundays. Food was excellent both at 'fast and in the restaurant. location was approx 250m from the tram which was two stops from the main city attractions. We looked around the other hotels in the area, looking at rooms, eating there etc and we would not change our hotel for another of similar standard.",,,

The location was within walking distance of Las Ramblas, but far enough away that it was in a quiet and safe location. The front desk staff was super. The apartment was modern and clean.

Only bad thing was door was locked at 10pm and you had to park and walk all the way around to front of building to get in,"stayed at this location because you could get a 2-1 voucher for shanghi circus no microwave or refrigerator was in room had to call front desk and was told I would be charged for them I explained I had called and was told there was no charge hairdryer was not in room at 730 a I called front desk no answer for 1and a half hours sent son down in breakfast room was told no one answers phone till 9am I killed two roaches in room and wanted to report this I was told it was the weather I stayed in Branson for 2 weeks total at other locations and never seen any roaches just flies breakfast juice was watered down only had cereal bread and a few donuts Only stayed here one day Lighting was terrible ac made lots of noise needed new matresses I booked 2 rooms for my family online. Both rooms were advertised as having microwave and refrigerators..there was none in either room.... I called the desk and the girl said she would try to get in contact with the managers....when she called back she said she could get us a microwave only and in only 1 room. In the meantime we found dirty rags lying in the bathroom floor and a guy told us to be careful walking in the walkway to our rooms because a copperhead snake was loose. We checked right out and went to another hotel. Not a good experience. I rated this hotel a 3 but I was really torn on that. We stayed in Branson on an extremely busy weekend (Memorial Day Weekend) and finding a place without prior reservations was very difficult so by the time we checked in we were just thankful to be there. The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed talking to them. The property itself was OK. The walkways were dirty but the swimming pool area was nice. There was an area to sit and read a book or just enjoy the outdoors. However, the rooms were not so great. I agree with one of the other posts that the lighting in the rooms was terrible. The beds were old and lumpy. The mattresses definitely need to be changed and the carpet was dirty. The bathrooms were average. I guess for the price of $54.00 night it was ok. I have stayed in worse places before. But if you are not particular about your room and are traveling on a budget, I would recommend this place. Stayed there May 2012. Came home with bedbug bites. Lighting in room so poor you could not read a book at night. Breakfast was terrible - anyone witha sugar problem would have to bring your own. Called to tell manager of bedbug problem and was told he would go see if he saw any -- no apology or anything. Would never stay there or recommend it to anyone again. Mattresses were completely worn out. Cheap price, but there are better hotels for that amount. Bathtub had a hole that was plugged with silicone by a two year old. Bathtub drain plug wouldnt hold water. Shower had half pressure because the plug that starts the shower didnt seal, so the other half of pressure came out drain spout. Wife and daughter complained they couldnt get the soap out of their hair. Dogs that the houses have behind hotel bark all the time. Beds are cheap mattresses and two pillows dont equil one. Please folks, shop for another place to stay. Very disatisfied. We have stayed at this hotel more than once and was satisfied but this stay will probably be our last. Let me start with the free continental breakfast. They were serving toast, frozen waffles and donuts from I don't know where along and cereal, Not Good. Next is the free wifi. It is free but only if you are close to the lobby. The rooms are in dire need of a update. The positives is that the pool and courtyard is nice and relaxing as well as being close to some of the good attractions. I guess for 150.00 with tax for 3 days you get what you pay for. As for the staff they have always been helpful and friendly.",,,
loveducks,233882,"We stayed with this hotel as part of the Contiki tour. The coach is not able to park outside the hotel because of it's narrow roads. So we are dropped along the main road and we had to drag our luggage for about 10-15mins uphill to where the hotel is. Perdestrian roads leading to the hotel were narrow as well. Luggage with wheels is definately an advantage here. The hotel is part of a chain hotels and it's quite a decent size, different from the family hotel we had been staying in. The lifts are small and wouldn't fit more than 2 people and 4 luggages so once again it's carrying the luggage up to the 4th floor. The room is a decent size, old decor but it's clean. The bed is a proper twin size bed and there's enough space to actually open our luggage up. There's a wooden rack/shelve which I assume it's for luggage but we just place ours on the floor. There's a long writing desk which is useful and the TV sits on it. There is also English channel which is great for following up on the latest world news. No Kettle or cups provided in the room. Plastic cups were provided in the bathroom.Internet provided in rooms which is always a plus. No mini fridge but there is a safe in the cupboard. However to use the safe, you need to pay 5Euro per day and a 50Euro deposit to the reception. We just lock all our valuables in the luggage. The flooring is wooden which also adds to the cleaniness. The bathroom isn't very and there's a bidet in it. Shower over bathroom and it's very tiny. Because the light is just where the entry is, the shower area is very dim, makes it very creepy when taking a shower. The window in the bathroom can be opened slightly but you get to hear the bathroom next door. In fact the room are so closed to one another you do not even need to open the windows. We are advise the tapwater in Barcelona might give us stomachache. The nearest metro station from the hotel is about 20mins walk and another 20-30mins into the city. Single trip ticket is about $1.50Euro. I've stayed in this hotel as part of the Contiki tour. Personally I do not like this hotel and will not be my choice when I return to Berlin. But there's nothing wrong with it it just wouldn't suit into my preferences. The hotel is rather far away from the city but you can catch a train (about 1km-1.5km, i walk for 20mins) from the hotel on the main road. Its not a very well lighted road from the train station to the hotel so ladies be careful. The deco in the room is very old fashion and almost everything is old fashion in the room. There have 3 lifts and one is slightly bigger than the other 2 which is always a relief for people with big luggages or waiting to go into the lift when there's a big tour group. There is a restaurant and bar and breakfast is very good(good variety for a tour group) The shower is very tiny and the drainage is rather bad as the water doesn't seem to go down the drain quick enough, so after one shower, you have to wait for 10mins before the next one can jump in. the only good thing to me about this hotel is there is actually 3 supermarkets right across the hotel (one is about 5mins walk away). I've got very good service from the lady in the bar when I asked for hot water but the ladies at reception were grumpy. This hotel is situated about 20-30mins away from the city centre by metro. Again one of those Italian hotels with tiny facilities, such as lifts. Tiny bathroom with bidet and shower. Bedroom is big enough to open up 2 big luggage. Wardrobes with hangers. No coffee/tea making facilities. No English channels available on TV programs. Walking distance to the Metro, about 20mins. This will not be my choice of accommodation if I were to return to Rome again but it's definitely decent and clean enough to stay in.","This hotel was fine. The rooms were clean and I was happy with that. But wifi is limited to the lobby. Also, the location is not good at all. If you have a car you are okay, but it is a 12 minute walk (I counted it) to the metro. And the neighborhood is not scenic at all. I would not stay here again. The only reason I did was because my tour was booked here. Oh, take a cab from the airport if you fly in. I made the mistake of taking publich transit and it was not fun.

I've got very good service from the lady in the bar when I asked for hot water but the ladies at reception were grumpy. The hotel is a short walk from the metro stop, which you have to rid to get into the centre of the city. But is on a couple of line so good transport links - esp. if you are coming into the Schonefeld airport. Hotel was clean and staff friendly enough. Rooms were a good size and beds comfortable. Very good for the price. There are also plenty of supermarkets around hte hotel if you want to pick up food. It was a okay hotel. The two major problems with the hotel was the fact that they only had wifi in the lobby and the staff was not very helpful. It was also pretty far from the centre of Berlin. But, other then that it was fine. The rooms were nice, though if you stay here try to stay on one of the bottom floors. I was on the top floor and only one elevator went to the top so it took forever to get to my room. We stayed here on a National Holidays ,Berlin Xmas Markets tour for 3 nights in November.It was a good base for all the attractions which were all easily got to via the Uber station at the bottom of the road.The hotel was clean ,warm and served its purpose,but we did feel the food let it down a bit,also they had put us on an 8pm dinner ,which was far too late. The bar area, was pleasant ,the staff were very nice even though their english was a bit limited,and we did not think it was overpriced.My gripe ,if it is one ,was that it was really a bit far for a short break by road,but that is National holidays fault for not pointing out the fact that on a 6 day break you only get 2 full days there,but thats not the hotels fault. Hotel good, clean and comfortable. A little out of town but OK if you have transport or use the metro. the cost was â¬30.00 for a taxi back from town. food was good and there was a good choice. bedroom walls are a bit thin we could hear everything that the people were saying in the next room. We stayed at the Globus City Hotel for three nights in December 2011 as part of a National Coach Holiday âBerlin Christmas Marketsâ tour on a half board basis. The hotel is located in the old East German part of the city and thus the views from the rooms are not exactly awe inspiring, just your normal boring former Communist architecture. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and come with en-suite facilities, a TV and a hair dryer. Soaps come from a wall dispenser and the towels are a tad tired and rough. There is no mini-bar, fridge or coffee making facility. There are seven floors and two lifts which, can occasionally be quite busy, with coach parties arriving and departing. Reception and maid service are efficient and friendly. The half board option of buffet meals was satisfactory although on one morning the breakfast demand overwhelmed the staff and for quite a while, the tables were left uncleared and the food offer was not replenished. The hotel is located about a fifteen minute direct walk from Magdalenenstr U Bahn Station from where you can catch the U5 to Alexanderplatz for a single fare of 2.30 Euros. From here you can start your tour of the more architecturally rewarding centre of Berlin or catch onward trains, trams and buses. if you have a car, I'd definitely recommend staying here because the hotel is affordable, comfortable and clean. however, if you're prepared to travel to the center by metro (around 25 min), it's well connected and we didn't mind it. our room was spacious and clean. breakfast was too expensive for our budget, but there are supermarkets across the street which was great. a kettle in the room would have been great. internet in the room is also pretty expensive, but at least it's free in the lobby. We stayed with Friends for a three day Christmas Market break . We found the Hotel very clean good food and in a quiet area Yes it was pricey but you are in a Euro Zone so we did expect it Water was 4.50 euros for a 75cl Bottle .would have liked a choice of Beers though. Staff were Friendly but the odd smile would have been nice .We enjoyed the Hotel which as been said is only 15 mins to 20 mins walk away . Disappointed with Markets though much prefer the larger ones than lots of small ones This hotel was the best value we could find in Berlin. Located very near to Frankfurter Allee it is also reachable for train-travellers. Friendly staff, helpful when we had for example to change the room. Breakfast is not included (12,50â¬ p.P.), can be worth it but lots of cafes outside for lower price. Rooms were simple but quiet. No bad surprises for your money. Arrived thinking that the Ramada Globus might be in a dodgy part of Berlin or might be too far to the city centre (Alexanderplatz)...but it's not as bad as some reviews might have you believe. The hotel is a 10 minute (easy, one straight line) walk to Magdalenstrasse U-bahn stop, which has trains every 3 minutes into Alexanderplatz - another 5 minutes. It was clean, cheery and safe. The only downside was the lack of air-conditioning in the rooms, which for this particular weekend was a problem...but we opened the windows. If you want a Â£30 a night, clean, safe hotel and don't mind a wee walk, this is a good bet",,,
April M,282741,"I stayed at this hotel for my last night in Europe. What a wonderful way to end my trip. The hotel is close to the airport and within a short walking distance to the metro. The hotel staff were very friendly and helped me out a great deal with directions to several points of interest. The rooms were clean and the beds did a fine job. I even got a laugh from the a la carte pillow pamphlet. Our room faced an open parking lot which was fine because our main purpose of the hotel was to sleep. Free internet access is available in the lobby. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the price we paid to stay at the Velada Madrid Hotel. We had stayed at a dive in Malaga and paid the same price!! I would recommend the Velada Madrid hotel. We stayed here before our cruise last year in April in a king suite.

Stayed here before the Madrid Marathon and had a really great experience because of the willingness of the hotel staff to give us information on the city, the cleanliness of the room, and the proximity to the metro. We chose the hotel because of the price and were very surprised for what we got out of it in comparison to what we've paid in similar amounts with many less amenities. Would recommend this hotel to someone who wants a good value, and who isn't afraid of using the metro or walking to get around town rather than being in the heart of town. Also liked the absolutely free airport shuttle, which we've found some hotels advertise an airport shuttle, but still charge a high fee for the service. Velada is a good very reasonably priced hotel close to the centre of madrid and only 11 euro in a taxi from the airport. rooms are fine and the staff speak good english....the breakfast is ok as well. The rooms are relatively spacious and well-maintained. The hotel is in a bland industrial/business district, but close to 2 metro stops (same line). Breakfast is average, and the hotel ""cafeteria"" has a very limited menu. Not many good restaurants within walking distance. This hotel is well appointed, with quiet, clean, spacious bedrooms. The shower in our room (143) was good and we also had a jacuzzi bath. The free wireless internet worked well and was easy to connect to. The breakfast buffet catered for every taste and offered a wide range of options but is perhaps a little overpriced at 15 euros. We didn't try out any of the channels on the TV, but I was surprised that it wasnt a flat screen. The big advantage for us was the free shuttle bus which took us to Madrid Barajas airport within 15-20 minutes. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. The hotel is huge, and is located some 20-25 minutes direct metro line from the city center (Plaza Espana, Callao etc). The breakfast is excellent, of course, the coffee sucks, but the bar is next door. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and clean. The TV should be flat screen and should offer wider range of TV channels from Europe, and rest of the World. Internet works well, shower is great but as in many other hotels, shampoo and shower gel are not very inspiring. If you arrive late in the evening there is a shop+restaurant just next door open until 1 AM. All in all, very good. I have stayed in this hotel more than 20 times in the last 8 years, always for business reason's. This hotel has never disappointed me, as it meets almost all execpations of a business traveller. I would not choose this hotel for family or touristic trip to Madrid. Positive points : modern hotel, spacious room, good service in the room, excellent restaurant, very nice bar, quiet, 15 min from airport Points to be improved : very impersonal breakfast room, far from city center (but metro is close by), internet connection never easy (they recently installed wireless connections, but was not working in my room during my last stay), Good: cleanliness, espacious rooms, in-room wifi, several local cafes nearby, metro station in 5 minutes walk, good value.... Bad: bit far from the centre although metro is nearby. Stayed here for a business training. Teh room was good, nice bathroom and good bed. Breakfast can be had in the cafe (cheap, basic but okay), or in the huge breakfast room (expensive). Latter is great, lots offered. Service is great, staff is very helpful. Cafe is nice, friendly staff here as well. Basic food there, but okay. Lunches offered during the training were good. It's a bit far (20 -30 min by metro) from the centre but in a safe feeling area. There is a big security problem in the hotel Velada On July 04 2010, I was robbed in the hall of this hotel in front of tens of people (claimed in police station San Blas-Vicalvaro). I was astonished by danger that I met in your hall and Iâll never come back to your hotel again.",,,
OregonJerry,258868,Such a deal...location between Puerto del Sol and Plaza Mayor. Room is spartan but solid bed and fine. And for $33 / day a real steal! Really enjoyed the stay and even used the free lobyy-only wif-fi on my Blackberry while sipping the free glass of cava provided!,"I was pleased to be able to book a very small but clean and nice room as I needed to change hotels rapidly, the rate was super good for a last minute booking: 70 euros for a pequenita small room with a single bed, the bed was really comfy, th bathroom perfect and the staff very nice. Came with good expectations based on other TA reviews; quite disappointed. Nice lobby area, but reception was minimal. Poor man or woman behind reception trying to manage everything (including bar area) on his/her own while other staff sat in the nearby telephone area. The first guest room offered was dismal with an awful odor. Second was acceptable but on closer look: frayed, moldy carpet, the bed mattress sagged, and overall the room was sad and outdated. Best thing was the bathroom: large and mostly clean. Went to the breakfast buffet in the morning, hoping for ""hotel redemption,"" but it was not to be. Very mediocre bread, practically not working toaster, less than average cereal and generic-tasting pastries. Plus the coffee was lukewarm (just as another TA review reported). I would say the reception person tried hard to please, but just couldn't manage the workload (I hardly blamed him/her). On a positive note, I was most appreciative when after two nights of extremely loud noise from a teenage tourist group, reception succeeded in quietening them down (Bravo!). All in all though, HCC needs to invest in staff and a hotel update to provide a truly pleasing, acceptable hotel for its patrons. I don't think it would take much, just a little TLC. Very nice and clean hotel. Polite and nice staff. The location in central Barcelona is excellent, with supermarkets, touristbuses/local buses right outside the door of the hotel. Next time in Barcelona, I'll reserve the same hotel. Really enjoyed the stay and even used the free lobyy-only wif-fi on my Blackberry while sipping the free glass of cava provided! Stayed here on business while attending a trade show in Barcelona. I had a double room on the 5th floor facing the street with a nice balcony. I wear ear plugs at night, but you may find it noisy if you wake easily so bring ear plugs. My double room was clean and a decent size for Europe. My bed was clean and comfortable, though the bedspread was outdated. The bathroom fixtures were updated and was clean and roomy. The carpet had stains so I guess they haven't upgraded the carpets in a while. My colleague stayed in a single room -- it was tiny, fitting not much else other than the twin bed and night stand, though the bathroom was an ok size. The buffet breakfast was very good with a large selection. If you want scrambled eggs or an omlette they will make it for you on request. The hotel staff was pleasant and responsive and didn't charge me to print out some documents. The location is good. It's on a well-known street and centrally located, near lots of shops and restaurants. Across the street is a large multi-level shopping mall. There is no metro within 1 or 2 blocks, but my colleague said he walked 10 minutes to a metro, so maybe that is close enough for some people. It was very easy to get a taxi in front of the hotel. They offer free Internet in the rooms (ADSL, they provide the wire). I had some trouble connecting, but my colleagues said it was just me! They also have free WiFi in the reception area and restaurant. Overall a pretty good experience! Overall it was fine for a budget hotel, but if I went back again I would find a hotel that was within easier walking distance to the center of town. Highly recommend taking the ""blue line and red line"" bus tours where you can hop on and off all day. There is so much to see in Barcelona, we just loved it. Great weather in October, though we did get one day of rain. Here are my main pros/cons for this hotel: Pros - Very large room and bathroom - Window that opens and air conditioning - Keycard needed to power room (very energy efficient) - Large bath towels - Lots of good restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping nearby - Good access to public transportation and tour bus stops - Decent breakfast with lots of options, including made-to-order eggs, bacon, etc. - Enough electrical outlets to plug in various devices - Price - Staff helpful for sightseeing advice Cons - No coffee maker, clock radio, or fridge - Horrible pillows - Terrible view out our window--our room looked out into a central area between buildings, and you could see directly into the rooms across the way, forcing us to keep our drapes closed when we were in the room - Room appearance was utilitarian looking and dreary; hotel in general was a little dreary and dated - A bit too far to walk to walk to central Barcelona attractions traveled with my husband and college student daughter. We all met up in Barcelona and realized how handicapped we were by not speaking the language. The front desk help (four young people) were always kind and helpful our exit on the bus when we caught the wrong bus.to the train and they gave us the correct bus number , over the cell phone to get us out to the main train station as we left for a parador in Tortosa. Location is in a safe area with lovely shopping near by, local buses near by, hop on hop off tour buses near by and restaurants near by or within a reasonable walk in high heels to excellent European style restaurants. Room is no frills but comfortable. 10 mins walk to Nou Camp- Amazing views from 8th floor, balcony, A/C close to Starbucks, KFC's, Mc D's, Chinese restaurant. 5 mins to Clinic Metro station, 2 mins to Taxi rank, next to Bus Touristic stops, both red route and blue route, Ave Diagonal is a fantasic tree lined 13km street. will be back and told staff that i'd be highly recommending this Hotel esp. Covadonga- it under rated and should diff be a 4 star- We stayed in the HCC Hotel Covadonga in Barcelona for a quick 3 night visit. It was everything we wanted in a hotel. Here is why. 1. The rates were very good. 2. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent, room was spacious with a nice window view, comfortable beds. The room was a nice size, especially for European hotels which can have small rooms. In short, we got good value for our money. 3. Location: It is within 30 minutes walking of Las Rambalas. It is not in the thick of things so I was able to sleep without hearing noise from the street, but there are several bus lines with stops right in front of the hotel for easy access to anywhere else in the city. 4. The staff were excellent. As strict Sabbath observant people we could not use our electronic key cards on Saturday, the staff were more than willing to go to the fifth floor to open our door for us. The hotel is also 5 minutes walking distance from the Synagogue. Bottom Line: Would highly recommend for people who want a good night's sleep, in an affordable hotel that is also clean, comfortable and nice with welcoming staff. When I travel to a new city, I like to split my trip in half - spending nights in two hotels in two different areas, going budget the first half and 4-star the second. This hotel was the ""budget"" part of the trip. This hotel was perfect for me - it met my list of ""musts"" (a private bathroom, cleanliness, and close to public transit) and it lacked only in areas that I don't care about (spaciousness and view). The only negative for me was the lack of sound-proofing... although it was very quiet 99% of the time, I could hear everything that was going on when someone walked down the hall, and when my neighbors shut their doors, my room felt like an earthquake. There is a lot of shopping nearby, but it is a very expensive part of town. However, the bus stops right in front of the hotel, and it takes you right to the metro - so all of Barcelona is easily accessible (for 5 euros, you can ride all buses and subways all-day). Hotel was very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and courteous - alhough I don't speak Spanish and their English was limited, I was able to convey to them that I had forgotten my electricity convertor and the clerk leant me one at no charge). Beware of the breakfast buffet - although their are signs for it everywhere that don't indicate a charge (possibly leading you to believe it is included at no charge), it costs 16 euros per person. Overall, I feel this was an excellent value and would recommend it for anyone who doesnt mind ""no-frills""",,,
Alex K,115268,"I was surprised by stuff's willingness to help in all my requirements. It concerns my traveling documents, taxi, advices about shopping and walking. I liked the place where the hotel is located - there is all really around. Flexible in pricing, not many people (the hotel is not big). Just what I want. Thanx a lot. Beautiful hotel for a special occasion. The outdoor showers are a great touch and the spacious and modern rooms are the perfect place to relax in wine country. The Hotel's people were serius professionals and their experience helped us to enjoy a very pleasant stay. The rooms were with exellent view to Bosphorus channel and Bridge , day and night, also very clean and with all the comforts you may need. The spot is very good (you are not far from the center, but far enough in order not to disturb you with noise,crowd etc.) also the local ""sea Bus"" stop is in front of the Hotel, witch is very useful for Instabul's traffic ""stuck"" at the rush hours. At the Hotel the brekfast is exellent and is served with sea view... We defenetly come again and we think is highly recommended !!! Alp - Bahar thank you again you are absolutely fabulus... Alexandros - Katerina This hotel is located about 2 small blocks away from the Metro station, very central location, easy access to the main hot spots. The staff is very friendly and helpful, they speak many languages. Our room was bigger than we expected, and much bigger than other italian hotels we stayed in that were much pricier. The bathroom was very clean, fresh towels daily, our tub was spotless, and the breakfast crossaints were delicious. I highly recommend this place. I went to university in New Orleans, so I do consider myself somewhat of an expert when it comes to the city. You have to set your standards a little lower when looking at New Orleans. With that being said, the hotel is housed in a beautiful southern mansion directly on St. Charles Ave. As a student, I used to visit the bar frequently. Recently, I stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend. The hotel feels authentically New Orleans! With that being said, it could use a bit of a touch up. It's such a beautiful home; a little restoration would help it to shine to its true grandeur! Beautiful hotel for a special occasion. The outdoor showers are a great touch and the spacious and modern rooms are the perfect place to relax in wine country. We drove up from LA via Monterey as part of our coastal sightseeing tour. We booked this hotel prior to arrival. When we checked in, the staff said that the room we book (2 doubles or similar) was not available. Instead, they booked us a 2 room (two bedrooms, a kitchenette, couch, sinks, two bathroom and big table) suite up on the 8th floor. We were very pleased and inpressed especially because we didn't pay anything extra. Our stay was very comfortable and enjoyable. The pool was on the 3rd floor but was outside (with San Fran weather, was not good) and very large. The problem I had with this hotel was that on our 3rd night, there was a large wedding being held in the banquet and the guest were very noisy and did illegal things. The cops came and arrested a few and the weddign party had to be asked to leave. The other minor problem I had with this hotel was that our 2nd T.V. kept on braking down and we had to get a mechanic up to fix it almost every day. The good thing was that he gave us free Wi-Fi because we complained instead of paying $10 a day. I would recommend this hotel to buisness travellers and to families. Stayed at Iberostar Qutzal-Tucan for 7 days with wife and kids. We have been there before about 6 years ago and it was way better, as far as amenities, food quality and variety. I guess recession is taking its toll. This time was unexpectedly low quality of food, buffets and a-la-carte restaurants included. Food was bland and not very good, same menus every single day, drinks are very sugary because of cheap liquor used. As far as the services - rooms were cleaned, but some facilities could be better. Often smelled as sewer erupted somewhere. Grounds are not kept as it used to be. When we arrived - there was a gallon of purified water in the room, which lasted about 2 days and was never replenished, even after I asked several times. Drinking water bottles in the fridge were replaced once in a week. Sheets had some spots on them, donât even want to guess... as far as service from people working there in the bars and restaurants - I would give 6 stars - hard working always smiling and ready to serve. Beach was kind of messy too. Pool was cold, but because of the low 50-60 F temps at night. Overall was a nice vacation on the beach but we would not come back to this resort.","I went to university in New Orleans, so I do consider myself somewhat of an expert when it comes to the city.

Recently, I stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend. The hotel feels authentically New Orleans! With that being said, it could use a bit of a touch up. It's such a beautiful home; a little restoration would help it to shine to its true grandeur! I stayed here with my son three winters ago when he was still in high school and visiting Loyola New Orleans as a senior. It was one of the hotels suggested by the University. My son has since enrolled there and loves the school and New Orleans. When we first arrived, we were enchanted. A zydeco band was playing in the lounge and there was a lot of activity. It seemed perfect for New Orleans and we both loved it. However, we were on the third floor and were there the week after Mardi Gras. Maybe the third floor does not get used much. That would explain the layer of dust on some of the bed pillows. There were no mattress pads on either of the beds and very thin sheets. The bathroom was old and the soap caddy in the shower was rusted and chipping apart. For the couple days that we were there, the same Mardi Gras beads sat in the hallway near a doorway. It looked like no one had vacuumed within an inch of the walls for months (this applied to the carpeted stairway as well.) It was during this trip that I discovered TripAdvisor when I went on line at the hotel to try to figure out if I should try to move. We have returned here for food and drinks because the veranda and lounge are so charming, but only when we are not rushed because the service is so slow. I would guess that the bulk of The Columns income is from the college kids who come here for poetry readings and music and that they just don't make enough on overnight guests for the management to care at all. And that the people who do stay here repeatedly (some have posted reviews here) either don't mind the shabby/dirty conditions or are able to request the rooms that are clean (assuming there are some.) I just checked back in to see if current reviewers were experiencing cleaner conditions than I had but I see that little has changed, prompting me to write this delayed review. This could be such a cool place to stay with some elbow grease and new linens/mattresses! We booked the bridal suite for my husband's 30th birthday. We have never been more excited. I had called a couple of times to make sure everything was set. We had a bottle of champagne added to the room. When we arrived, the hotel had given away our room to another guest coming in early!! They were apologetic but stuck to their guns and bumped us to an awful room. Old, small, musty and dirty with no view at all. The floor was softer than the bed. (Actually all the beds are like that.) We were heart broken and finally asked for our money back. My mother had paid for this for us and she called and tried to reason with them. The man at the front desk was nice and polite as was the manager. But, would not budge on their decision to favor someone else over someone who had had reservations for a month for this room. They did offer us a free night of our choice at another time. We will probably go, but you better believe I will be calling many times to insure we still get the room. I will also bring a memory foam pad for the bed. I will never pay for this hotel. Like other reviewer said, only go there for a drink on the patio or at the bar. So we left and my mother made us a reservation at the Ritz Carlton which is much nicer and was actually CHEAPER then the bridal suite at The Columns. We are here now. The Ritz is Highly recommended!!!!! We stayed at the Colunms the 4th of Feb thru the the 6th and let me tell you this place is the best! From the location , the beauty of this old classic Mansion, the bar, the food, the staff ....It has it all! We were here for my sons wedding (which he had right on the lovely front porch) The area is surrounded with beautiful historic homes We took a hour walk & just loved looking at everything! The trolley runs right in front of the Columns so great for getting around if you don't want to drive. You can walk to some area restaurants & the best little Wine Bar is just donwn the street! But you really don't have to leave at all because the bar in the hotel is very popular with guests & just folks looking for a cool place to enjoy a cocktail. The food here is delicious They serve breakfast( included with the room) Also lunch. dinner ,& lovely appetizers! The rooms are clean & comfortable furnished with the era of the home. Word has it there is a resident ghost ! The staff is friendly & helpful! The feel of the place is grand, eclectic,yet homey! So if your looking for a place that has it all this is where you need to stay! We have stayed at the Columns Hotel many times because we love the location, the people and the beautiful front porch bar facing St Charles Ave. The staff is wonderful and the breakfast is delightful. The bedrooms, however, really need attention. The blinds in the windows have layers of dust on them, the bed linens and towels are Motel 6 quality, and the bathtub really needed reglazing. We couldn't even get the tiny radio to work during our last stay. This lovely St Charles jewel deserves more than this and with rooms ranging in price from $160 to $230/night on weekends, guests should experience better. I attempted to make reservations over the phone with the gracious clerk, who took my information and said I would receive a reservation confirmation via email. After no confirmation came, I called back to learn the room was booked but another room was available which I, again, booked. When no confirmation came, I called back to hear that room was also booked. Which leads one to believe you could speak to the reservation clerk, request a room, receive assurances that the room was reserved, and arrive at the hotel only to find you are OUT OF LUCK! The Columns Hotel is a great little historic hotel on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans. The hotel has several charming historic rooms and a great balcony to look out upon the garden district at night. One of the best parts of the hotel is its historic bar that is all the more charming considering the small size of the hotel itself. We really had a great time at the Columns. We had the Sunday brunch and it was very enjoyable but with all of the awesome offerings in the city for food I'm not sure that I would eat at the hotel vs. a local restaurant the next time. Highly recommended and a great value!",,,
Maria G,625984,"Great stay at this little hotel in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. The rooms are large for Roman standards and extremely clean. The staff is very helpful and breakfast is very nice. The hotel is 15 minutes from the city centre by public transportation, and Termini Station is just 10 minutes away. I highly recommend this hotel, you will get a bargain compared to the other places in Rome. If you do not mind taking the bus, this is the place to be when in Rome. My bf and I spent 3 days here. The hotel is very nice. there are 2 pools and hot tubs. One for children one for adults. They have free activities on hotel grounds ei. snorkeling and scuba lessons. On Wednesday they had a musical show by the adult pool. The restaurantat the hotel was delicious. Only problem was adult pool was WAAAY over crowded. spent most of my time at the childrens pool which was more quiet, more shade so you're not baking in the sun, and not many children. I prefer no children on my vacations. Overall pleasant experience. Just recently got back from a trip to Europe. Spent a few days in Rome, at the Cortina Hotel. Excellent location, nice staff, and clean rooms. Walking distance to the Fontana Di Trevi, as long as other historical attractions Romeâs historical center. Very pleased with the overall service of the hotel. I visit this hotel and it was very nice. People are friendly and the place is amazing.The view was pretty nice and we appreciate that the rooms were clean. We really had a great vacation and we were pleased about spending quality time. For sure I will be back again. Thank you guys and see you next time! Firstly, I never seen in my life Hotel General Manager yelling his Staff at the lobby. Please I would like to thank each member of your perfect staff. We stayed at this hotel at the end of a cruise. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful. Whenever we asked for anything they went out of their way to see that our needs were met. They knew it was my birthday-sent a cake. There are three complimentary computers available on first floor.","Location was amazing... Very close Spanish steps , beautiful shopping area, all brands (LV , D&G , Gucci ... ) Staff were friendly , helpful ,, The owner was nice , he helped us a lot while staying in inn Spagnya.. The night shift front desk was really helpful and always ready to answer questions and give advices where to go and how to get there... If it's your first time to Rome it's very easy to find your hotel, you will never get lost ;) Big supermarket just 5 minutes walking from the hotel Metro (Spagnya station ) less than 3 minutes from hotel, where you can get to all Rome nice and famous places. Fountain di trevi 10 minutes walking the hotel is standard, standard room, standard breakfast. No elevator (4th floor is not easy)! No Internet in the rooms... Ask to change the bed sheet if you feel it's not clean, they will change it :) I visit this hotel and it was very nice. People are friendly and the place is amazing.The view was pretty nice and we appreciate that the rooms were clean. We really had a great vacation and we were pleased about spending quality time. For sure I will be back again. Thank you guys and see you next time! This hotel was so poor that my husband and I called our travel agent as soon as we saw the room and asked to be moved. We were booked in a standard double room, which, from their website, looks delightful! Gross misrepresentation of their rooms, our room was filthy with excessively chipping paint on the ceiling about the shower (see photo), large dust balls hanging from the bathroom fan, mold behind the bathroom sink, a toilet paper holder that was barely connected to the wall and kept dropping the toilet paper, water damage near the window, cigarette burns in the comforter which also appeared as though it had been dragged in the street for how much dirt was apparently ground into the fabric, and a mini-fridge with food particles and sticky liquid remnants! This room was on the second floor. When they showed us a room on the third floor, it was better, but still had cigarette ashes on the window sill (we had booked a non-smoking room), cracking paint and a rusty shower door. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel! We have read other reviews that the rooms are tiny! And they are tiiiiinnnnnyyyy! Super Tiny! However where we were located, it was unbeatable! We had Gucci right out the front of the hotel, The Spanish Steps literally about a minute's stroll away... and the entire shopping strip at our doorstep! Great if you love shopping and being in the middle of it all. Service from the staff was good. The hotel does not stand out in the street, it is a doorway between Pucci and Dior but is worth finding. I arrived a couple of hours early and asked if I could leave my bag at reception. I have found at most larger hotels they will take bags but it is not possible to have a room until their check-in time. I was pleasantly surprised to be told there was a room ready so I was able to go off sightseeing without having to worry about going back to check in. The room was comfortable and clean. The hotel is small. It does not have a lift, bar or restaurant but what it lacks in those amenities it more than makes up for with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The location is wonderful, close to the Spanish Steps, the metro and streets full of bars and restaurants. On the morning I left, the hotel had booked a taxi for 8am. I went down about 7.45am and checked out. I was asked if I had eaten breakfast and I pointed out breakfast was not until 8am so I would get something at the airport. I was told that the waitress was in the breakfast room and I was welcome to have something to eat and I would be called when the taxi arrived. My stay at the Inn Spagna Room Hotel was a pleasant relaxing experience and I would not hesitate to stay there again.",,,
Tim_Norway,200370,"I didnÂ´t expect to stay in a lavish location in central Berlin on my budget, but this was worse than expected. Booked an apartment to get a balcony and a bathtub, both wanted comforts that I donÂ´t have at home. On arrival the apartment looked more like a closed down hospital. The rooms were huge, but insanely ugly decorated. Tasteless furniture, a so called kitchen with nothing,but a sink and a minibar. The bathtub could never be used expect for very very late at night or early early morning as there was no hot water. ReceptionÂ´s response to the lack of hot water was that we should just let it run for a few minutes and it would be ok. After 30 minutes of letting the water run we finally gave up. No Wifi connection in the apartment building (not like it would have been much of an effort to set up a network there as well), the TV did not work even though we asked the reception on numerous occasions to look into it. The only response we got was the question: Is it plugged in, did you turn it on, etc. Promises were made that someone would look into it, but nothing more happened. The breakfast, which is not included in the price (costs 6,50 Euro extra) is not worth the price. You get a basic breakfast of boiled eggs, something that resembled scrambled eggs and on a couple of occasions cold coffee. Various hams and some cheese, cereal and fruit as well. The staff however was very nice and the pastry was freshly baked each morning. The location is very central though, a very short walk from Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburger tor and the museums. The location is also very close to the U-Bahn. The staff was very helpful with locating things on the map, giving tips and advice. I would give the staff 5/5 if it wasnÂ´t for the hot water and TV incidents. Do some more research and find another hotel! A very cheap hotel within GREAT reach of the metro & trains! The airport express bus stops literaly 3 minutes walk from the hotel! The hotel was quiet, clean, spacious room, wonderful balcony, very helpful service! Will stay here again for sure! A very cheap hotel within GREAT reach of the metro & trains! The airport express bus stops literaly 3 minutes walk from the hotel! The hotel was quiet, clean, spacious room, wonderful balcony, very helpful service! Will stay here again for sure!","We had an exceptionally large, clean and nicely appointed room on the 6th floor, very quiet and with free wifi. This hotel is perfectly placed, right by Mitte underground station, and an easy walk to Museum Island and Potsdamerplatz. And at 80 euros per night for the double room, very reasonable. The staff were pleasant and helpful. We would definitely stay here again, but would probably have breakfast (not included) elsewhere - there is a Starbucks around the corner. I stayed in Kubrat Hotel from 29th October - 31st October 2011. Really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Excellent Location its literally round the corner from check point Charlie, hellium ballon ride and part of berlin wall. Staff are very friendly at reception, went to restaurant for dinner one night, had a lovely dinner and again staff were friendly. Hotel is very clean and its a warm comfortable environment. Enjoyed the fact that the room had a heater and also a fan. The mini bar was great and a selection of several drinks Great Value for Money Only little problem i had, i was away with my boyfriend for my birthday and i wanted a double room and we were given a twin room and was advised there was no double rooms left which was a dissapointment when i wrote this on request months ago when booking this hotel. Apart from that small problem, GREAT HOTEL, GREAT HOLIDAY, i would recomend this hotel Thanks for a great time Bad experience overall. Went there for conference. Location is central and convenient, and people at the reception were nice. This ends the positive things about the hotel. We stayed in the ""Apartments"", large suites in a separate buinding. First of all, there was no internet connection possiblity in the rooms, despite what was written on the website. Internet was free only in the lobby. Restaurant and breakfast were quite poor. The room (ground floor, Apt. 1) was VERY noisy, it`s right on the street and has also some noisy neighbors. I was waken up several times in the middle of the night. The room is somehow old, the bathroom had dirty spots (nothing big, to be fair) and some long-expired cookies were in the room fridge. The WORST thing was an itchy substance present in all linens. My skin was slightly itching evey day as soon as I walked in. My colleague had the same experience. Since I have no allergies, that must have been sone low-quality product used for cleaning. Overall everything seemed a bit run-down. It`s not very cheap, so I wouldn`t really go there again. Excellent location, clean, but they must fix their free wifi, it is unacceptable for business use to be disconnected every now and then. Please offer free wifi without advertisements. reception staff was very friendly & efficient. we were checked in very quickly. room was very large, clean and comfortable, with a small dining table. bathroom was very spacious and clean. even though the room was facing road, room was not noisy. breakfast was good with many choices. location was very convenient , which is close to the U bahn. few bus routes, which is linked to hot attractions are passing in front of the hotel. also there are few tourist hot spots in the vicinity, but i could not visit due to my pre-planned program. I didnÂ´t expect to stay in a lavish location in central Berlin on my budget, but this was worse than expected. Booked an apartment to get a balcony and a bathtub, both wanted comforts that I donÂ´t have at home. On arrival the apartment looked more like a closed down hospital. The rooms were huge, but insanely ugly decorated. Tasteless furniture, a so called kitchen with nothing,but a sink and a minibar. The bathtub could never be used expect for very very late at night or early early morning as there was no hot water. ReceptionÂ´s response to the lack of hot water was that we should just let it run for a few minutes and it would be ok. After 30 minutes of letting the water run we finally gave up. No Wifi connection in the apartment building (not like it would have been much of an effort to set up a network there as well), the TV did not work even though we asked the reception on numerous occasions to look into it. The only response we got was the question: Is it plugged in, did you turn it on, etc. Promises were made that someone would look into it, but nothing more happened. The breakfast, which is not included in the price (costs 6,50 Euro extra) is not worth the price. You get a basic breakfast of boiled eggs, something that resembled scrambled eggs and on a couple of occasions cold coffee. Various hams and some cheese, cereal and fruit as well. The staff however was very nice and the pastry was freshly baked each morning. The location is very central though, a very short walk from Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburger tor and the museums. The location is also very close to the U-Bahn. The staff was very helpful with locating things on the map, giving tips and advice. I would give the staff 5/5 if it wasnÂ´t for the hot water and TV incidents. Do some more research and find another hotel!",,,
una1982,1005656,"This is a new, modern hotel in the trendy gaslamp district. Rooms are excellent, staff are really helpful. It has a small gym that has some weights and machines but it worth a visit. It appears to be pet friendly but there is no smell from the furry friends if you do not have one! It has a vibrant bar and I would advise anyone to stay here. Although this is not in the centre of Rome it is easily accesible by metro or bus, it is in a lovely residential area that is safe and offers an insight into how people live in Rome. The rooms are modern and clean, the shower has good pressure for Rome. There is a lovely terrace were they serve breakfast, staff are lovely and very helpful.

The rooms are modern and clean, the shower has good pressure for Rome. There is a lovely terrace were they serve breakfast, staff are lovely and very helpful. We really loved this hotel. The main building is beautiful although we were staying in one of suites in the garden. Another review here mentions the smell of mould in one of these, but this problem had gone by the time we came here in autumn 2011. The suite itself was beautiful, huge bedroom, flatscreen TV, small private patio area screened by shrubbery, beautiful and large bathroom with spa bath. And so quiet and peaceful, with a walk through the garden in the morning for breakfast in the conservatory. It was also spotlessly clean. It didnt serve evening meals but had a bar. 10 mins walk from Bologna station but so what? Nothing much around the area to speak of but we found a nice local restaurant (can't recall the name!). It was only a few minutes on the underground into the centre of Rome. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Although at first sight the area might appear deserted and the hotel abandoned, it is actually far from truth. The hotel is very clean and modernized inside. The staff were fluent in English and were very helpful. I'm not sure if our room was standard or upgraded fro honeymooners, but everything was sparkling clean and the bathroom spacious. The fridge however wasn't working and one of the staff members tried to make it work but something just wasn't right. Also the shower-head wasn't switching modes but couldn't care less about that. To my surprise, the area seemed to be fairly safe, as we constantly made trips back and forth at night with no incident. But it CAN appear intimidating owing to its very quiet neighborhood. The walk to Bologna subway station is at least 10min (unless you make a run for it) and the buses take longer to get to the center, so I recommend the subway. The full breakfast was great, something we really missed in some of our consequent hotels. Overall, if you don't mind the walk to the subway, this hotel is an amazing find! PS: do your research on what's closed on Mondays in Rome and what season is the ""vacation"" season for the locals - it would save you a few surprises when you face the closed doors of a certain attraction or restaurant The hotel is in the pleasant embassy quarter in the north east, too far away from the centre to walk, but a relatively easy bus ride away from the Repubblica metro stop. Still, for such a distant location it is an expensive hotel. Upon first view I tended to understand the steep price, because the Principe Torlonia looks great from the outside, and the garden, while not big, is also very nice. The big problem came when entering the room. I should point out that we didn't stay in the main building, so I cannot comment on those rooms. We stayed in one of the special hotel suites in the little, separate building in the garden. While these suites were comfortable enough, the smell of mold and fungi was so strong that one could barely stand it. Ventilation did not solve it, so it must be a persistent problem. For this price this is really unacceptable. So if you decide to stay at this hotel, request that you are in the main building.",,,

Outside of the horrible customer service the hotel's rating of 2.5 starts is quite a stretch our bathroom was not ensuite and the heat was barely on so we also slept in our clothes with beanies just to keep warm. An all around bad experience! This hotel is dire. It claims on its website to be 3 star, but it does not merit even one. Their card says RAC and AA 3 star. RAC no longer award stars, and AA have not rated them, so this seems to be a false claim. 3 star requires a restaurant open to non-residents (it doesn't have one); rooms that are en suite (not all are); and a manned reception (it is mostly unattended). Their website claims that it is decorated to a high standard. It is not. It is run-down and grotty. Nice people - Zulfiqar and the lady who did breakfasts but the room was cold especially the Shower room which was in the hold - outside the room not very satisfactory. A window was boarded up not replaced. However, the breakfasts was fine the location was excellent apart from the fact that if you are forced to drive into the congestion zone to get to the hotel -even though it is just outside. However, fantastic car park further down Crawford St - a NCP ony Â£16 a night Room was clean and found the amenities quite pleasant. Location is easy to get to and close to lots of landmarks (if you like to walk.. otherwise easy access with nearby public transport). Also thought that the staff were polite and helpful...... HOWEVER we were placed around the corner from the hotel in an apartment with 4 stories of stairs and not lift. So if you have lots of luggage, health difficulties or children I would not recommend it. Additionally I accidently left a brand new dress hanging in the closet and when I emailed reception to ask if they had found it, it was reported that nothing had been handed in. So dont be as neglectful as I am, as your belongings are not returned if forgotton. I suggest you DO NOT book this hotel!!!! Do not give them you card details and they will automatically charge you the full amount tell you you can cancel this free of charge 2 days prior to the arrival date! NO if you cancel the room after looking into how BAD this hotel actually is, realising that the bathroos are not even en-suite! they will refund....Minus 5% !! for Admin charges?!!! without confirming they do this before taking surely this is theft? Was never made aware of this at the time of booking even though we clearly confirmed the terms and conditions when this was booked, Not only was this bad enough but while having this conversation with the guy in reception 'Lourds' he proceeded to tell us that he no longer wishes to discuss this and that this hotel is a 'SPECIAL' Hotel...... special he can say that again!! Do not hand over your card details to this awful awful hotel! Just check our the other reviews on here! So you can say you get what you pay for but the price is not even that reasonable! You can get other hotels which are in a different league to this one at the same cost! This place sounds like it need buldozing to the ground!! Booked a couple of nights away in London with my sister for a birthday treat, but things got off to a bad start when we were abruptly told that we would have to move rooms after one night as the room had been double booked.Our room was on the ground floor at the front of the house: reminded me of squalid student accommodation. Filthy windows, peeling dated decor and dirty, stained bath. We were offered no help with our bags. Staff were off-hand and impolite. Our second night was even worse. Once again no help with our luggage. Revolting dirty decor in a cramped,smelly and stiflingly hot room. The net curtains were almost black, and blood-stained! The bathroom was cramped and tatty and the shower was cold. We couldn't wait to get out of this place. What a disgusting experience! The entrance hall stinks of cigarrettes but the ""hotelier"" declared it a non-smoking hotel. The carpets have seen better days - about 20 years ago - and the rooms do not appear to have any on-suite facilities which, for the price, should be the very least on offer. In the room there was a desk, not one angle is either vertical or horizontal and looks as though it was constructed by a seven year old. The ""decor"" is about as old as the carpets with missing pieces of paint all around the windows and doors. The ""wardrobe"" doors did not fit and were wedged shut - not that I would leave anything in them. You could hear every movement through the floor below and ceiling above. Not a recipe for a restfull nights sleep. Average of ÃÂ£124 per night without en-suite or breakfast is far too much for what amounts to a very run down has been hotel. This hotel was a joke. We barely had running water, when having a shower the water was cold all the time, even when you let it run for 15 minutes to get hot the water still was cold. The brochure claims you have a complimentary breakfast, but managment says its extra. The rooms are run down and old mildew smell is present every where. For this matter the whole hotel is run down the brochure must have been printed 30 years ago. The only postive thing I can say about this place is the location if great and convenient to wonderful restaurants. I sincerely wouldn't let my worst enemy stay at this dump. I booked this hotel through Lastminute. The description online (and the brochures I found in reception later) seemed to refer to an earlier incarnation of this hotel, and I notice that the AA, guide and RAC ratings on the door were about ten years out of date. I arrived and nobody was at reception, I finally found someone downstairs at the ""alternative"" reception, which was full of cigarette smoke, despite being a public building, and when I went up to the room the smoke seemed to permeate even 3 floors up. They insisted on taking my drivers' licence number, which now worries me as I can't think why they needed it. The room was like something out of a hostel, even the pictures had been unscrewed from the walls, leaving dirty outlines. The private bathroom was across the hall, which hadn't been specified in the booking details. The laughable price I was charged, ÃÂ£75 for a single, didn't include breakfast and as I'd already paid through Lastminute, there was nothing I could do to get a refund. A thoroughly miserable experience all round. An absolutely awful experience - dirty bed linen, fungi in bathroom, filthy room, discusting toilet, and when I complained the owner phoned the police. Stay at this hotel if you want cheap and nasty - totally ruined my birthday weekend We booked a couple of nights stay here through Travel Republic. The photos looked good and the location seemed ideal. However, the rooms were very dated, scruffy and not very clean with constant noise from the road making it impossible to sleep. Guests are given one key that fits all rooms so there is no security. At ÃÂ£100 per night without food it was very expensive. I would not recommend using the Georgian Hotel as you will be very disappointed. It is more like a run down hostel than a hotel. after walking miles to this dated and overpriced hotel me and my girlfriend didn't think things could get much worse. When we got into the room we saw that there were rat droppings in our room and areas where the rats has bitten into. Utterly disgusting, we are not the hardest people to please just clean sheets and a half decent location however this hotel offered neither. Really dissappointing!! I got to the hotel just after 11 PM having taken a day flight from the U.S. I rang the bell for 20 minutes until luckily some man who either worked there or was a family member showed up and let me in. He then woke up the clerk who is also one of the owners/managers who proceeded to give me some lip because I woke her up. As if this wasn't enough she then charged me 5 Pounds for Late Arrival. Beyond this appalling treatment the rooms are small, there is no A/C, the breakfast is lousy, and the ambiance is that of a run-down dump. I advise anyone considering this hotel for its convenient location to avoid booking here at all costs. Better to stay further away than put up with this dump and the sleazy owners.",,,

Did not want to sit or lay on older bedspreads; . Rooms are dark and outdated decor. Get the point..... This hotel has all the basic amenities and does the job for a quick stay. The staff were actually very friendly and nice and down to earth (translation: local twenty-something types with a somewhat laid back attitude, plus the parent-like managers). Reservations can be made online and it's all convenient. They also still use room keys which is a nice, classic touch. It's a little outdated with the tube TV, simple decor and bedding but it's not what I'd call shabby. Just simple. For example, our king room was spacious and equipped with a tiny kitchenette (stove! microwave! fridge! sink! very 70's!) but it didn't have a duvet on the bed, plush pillows or a comfy armchair. (There was a table with 3 sitting chairs, bench, closet, pullout ironing board in the room, iron, hairdryer. Make sure you request a room on ""the quiet side"" which means away from the pool area where people can hang out into the evening.) When my hubs and I stay up in Wine Country we're usually prepared to spend at least $200-250 per night + hotel taxes. Our usual place wasn't available (Indian Springs Resort and Spa), so we had to check out something new. We weren't disappointed in the John Muir as mainly a place to crash, get ready for the semi-formal wedding we were attending and spend just a little downtime before and after. A very reasonable deal for the Napa Valley considering Wine Country premium costs. This is perfect for adults who will be too busy hiking, wine tasting, dining out and shopping (and want to spend their $$$ on that rather than a hotel room). Or, a decent choice for posse on a budget (it's right off the highway with cheap eats nearby) who want to chill and don't mind the well-attended but dated atmosphere. The good thing is in California, stuff is slow to decay... I would recommend this place to friends that just needs a simple room versus a romantic high end hideaway. The location is great for this motel, however, it is tired and could use a good renovation. They may also want to consider adding better food to their complimentary breakfast and adding wine glasses to the room. They are in Napa, so that would be a good touch. We were greeted by a friendly staff and they allowed us to check in ahead of our scheduled time. The room was big and had a refrigerator, coffee pot and microwave in the room. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. We loved the cats that greeted us at the entrance of the hotel. It had a down home relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. A restaurant located next to the parking lot made it very convenient for dinner that also served a continental breakfast to hotel visitors. Very nice. Would definitely stay there again. If you are visiting wine country and plan on being at wineries all day long, like we did, then all you need is a nice,clean,convenient place to come back to. The John Muir Inn really is a glorified Holiday Inn. Extremely clean and perfect location. There is no reason to spend a lot on your room when all you really are doing is having a place to crash! We have stayed here twice and will be doing so again in the very near future. It is extremely important to start your day, especially when drinking a bunch of wine, with a good breakfast and since you get a coupon to Marie Calendar's(which is in the same parking lot),it makes it extremely easy to start your day with a good fulfilling breakfast. We stayed at John Muir for 2 nights as we visited Napa Wineries. The accomodations were good for an older hotel especially when you don't spend much time at the hotel. We had three females in one room and there was plenty of room for the roll away bed. It was a great location between wineries and downtown Napa. We would do it again and would recommend to friends Lousy location adjacent the main highway. Stop light outside your room makes this a perfect all night drag racing take off point. Don't bother lodging a complaint with any of the staff because they will do nothing. The Manager will not bother to contact you when you write or email him either. This place is mediocre at best. The hot tub and pool are always dirty and nobody seems to have any maintenance responsibilities at all. The trees along the parking lot are diseased and many are dying. The best thing about this place is the adjacent Marie Callanders. Don't fall for the ""in room spa tub"" that adds another $30 to your nightly bill. The one we ended up with did not provide a ""spa experience"" at all so we used it once and never bothered after that time. When I complained the folks at the front desk simply said; ""sorry"". This place is a rip off and you could do better at a Super 8 or a Motel 6. My wife and I had a last minute stay here in Napa (needed just one more day!!) We checked in that night. The hotel is located on the north side of the town of Napa, ok place. The property is older, a bit worn around the edges, but clean. The wifi is the type that keeps cycling on/off at about every 30 min. I did have some trouble getting my two year old laptop to sign on at first, after that it was ok. (we used the 2nd wireless option on the networks available). Front desk staff at night and in the morning was very professional. Overall, the room was a bit pricey (hey it is Napa) for the quality of the room. DO NOT eat breakfast at Marie Calendars next door... bad experiance. Stayed 2 nights with my family a couple weeks ago. Great napa location for wineries. Very friendly, helpful staff and cats in the lobby=I'm allergic but they didnt bother me at all. All who stay get $5 vouchers to use at Marie Callender resturant across the parking lot= excellent menu, great variety but so many good place to try in Napa makes it hard to take it all in. Would stay here again and highly recommend it to all.",,,

Will use this place next year when i return. Asabi Davis We came here after our lovely stay in staybridge suites and felt like we moved in to a cheapest motel room. The lighting in the room was terrible. Out of the 5 lights 3 were white and 2 were yellow. We picked this hotel due to the kitchen. The utensils were unclean, the sink used to clog and took a while to drain. No Dishwasher. The beds were really bad. very squeaky. After we pulled the covers for some reason the box spring and mattress looked like they were picked up from garbage and had stains all over. The last mattress I threw away was about 100 times better than this one. The carpet looked very old and unclean. Best thing was that, I told my wife that this place needs renovation and when we went out we say a large sign on the hotel wall that says ""All rooms are renovated"". TV was old, Drawer was old and looked like it came from a garage sale. water in the bathroom sink was stinky. Only Best thing about this place I think is its very close to the LAX airport. 7 mins flat. I wouldn't recommend this place.",,,
Liz_nz,630209,"This hotel is in an industrial part of the Asian side of Istanbul. On one side is a 6 or 8 lane highway, and on the other side are what appear to be industrial premises. As a female travelling alone, I was limited to staying in the hotel or taxi's to get out. The reception area is relatively plain with the restaurant off to the left hand side. Service was good and I was quickly checked into my room and the porter whisked my bag off to the room. He took his time to show me the TV, Mini-bar and bathroom before leaving me to unpack. I wasn't too impressed with the hotel as the taxi pulled up but once I was in my room it seemed fine. Lovely and clean with spotless white sheets. The room was well stocked with complementary toiletries, shoe polish, needle kit, etc. They also supplied slippers which were replaced each day. The room service menu is available for 24 hours per day although I found that the food wasn't as I was used to. (Why should it be, I was in Turkey!) I chose not to have room service the first night but went to the restaurant. It seemed to be full of men with no women in sight. The menu was the same as the room service menu but the service was fine. The food was OK, but I couldn't say more than that. I had pepper steak with fries and rice (I know - it's odd). I expected a traditional steak coated in cracked pepper. What I received was more like steak dianne. A braised steak covered in mushroom sauce, with some grilled jalapineo peppers on the side. Despite it not being as expected, it didn't taste bad. My biggest complaint is the highway, both the noise and the lights. The curtains are very thin and the lights from the traffic flashed through the room all night long. The bed was very firm (hard) but if the room had been darker and the noise less, I'm sure I'd have slept fine. There was free wi-fi but I couldn't get any internet connection either on my iphone or my notebook. If you go here request a room away from the highway. I stayed at the Eresin Taksim from Sunday 12th to Friday 17th February. The hotel is well positioned in a good area and surrounded by various restaurants and a major shopping street. Close by are shops where you can buy snacks and drinks to take back to your room if you want. The staff all spoke good English (if that's important for you) and were always polite and ready to help. At check in I was given an upgrade to Premium and the room was clean and well appointed, I had absolutely no complaints. I was on the 2nd floor but didn't notice any noise from other rooms or from the street below. I ate breakfast each day on the top floor restaurant that has a magnificent view over Istanbul, and also at the hotel restaurant which serves good Turkish food. They made every effort to accommodate my requests (e.g. can I have chicken and chips!) despite the fact they were not on the menu! Room service was good with meals taking around 20 mins to arrive. The food was good and I found the cost for room service to be outstanding. I had some difficulties connecting to the internet from my room but a brief phone call to reception quickly got me the help I needed. Well done Eresin Taksim, I will definitely stay again.","I spent long time in this hotel during business trips. Because of location and price there are not many other options. The hotel itself is not bad but with some major issues: the good rooms are just a minority: absolutely avoid internal rooms (no windows) if you want to breath, rooms facing the main street (highway) can e really noisy if you are not used to. Heating and conditioning system is really poor and old, no way to set a temperature, you can either be cooked or die for the cold, you never know... The restaurant doesn't worth the visit...

The bed was very firm (hard) but if the room had been darker and the noise less, I'm sure I'd have slept fine. There was free wi-fi but I couldn't get any internet connection either on my iphone or my notebook. If you go here request a room away from the highway. We were put up in the Prenses Hotel for a couple of nights when our flight home was cancelled due to snow. It's a lovely hotel, with very comfortable, spacious rooms, spotlessly clean. It has a lot of facilities which we didn't have time to make use of. All the staff were polite, friendly, and couldn't do enough to help. Breakfast was an enormous array of everything you could image, hot and cold. (except bacon, of course) As the airline was paying, we had a set evening meal, but that was also very good. The one drawback was the location - it's in the middle of an industrial estate on the asian side of Istanbul. Fine if you're looking for a stopover from Sabiha Gokcen airport, which is about 30 mins away, but about an hour by local bus and a ferry to the european side. Positive: I had a pleasant large room Adequate breakfast WiFi worked well and OK for business Recommendations Map on their website hides a bit the location (not enough for taxidrivers to find it) and you should check the location of the bostance suburb vs downtown Hotel information also says closest ferry is at 3km , but this one does not take you to downtown istanbul . The seaport to get you to downtown Istanbul is around 10km away restaurant had a limited food selection , but actually the food I got was quite good If you have some free time, it is not so easy to get to the tourist attractions of downtown istanbul from here. The taxidrive upon arrival from Ataturk took more than 2.5hours.",,,
lcordova84,226612,"I read other reviews here before booking this hotel. It is a nice place to stay if you don't need any frills. We didn't need anything fancy, just a decent place to sleep since we were just driving in for 1 night to see a concert at the Viejas Arena at San Diego State. The hotel doesn't have a good appearance on the outside, but it is in a nice residential area very close to the college. I would reccommend asking for a room that doesn't face the freeway if you're a light sleeper because the noise did bother me, though not my friends. The room was plain, but very clean inside. The beds along with the pillows and linens were very comfortable and clean. It was nice to have a microwave and refrigerator in the room. An added touch was the morning breakfast. They have waffles, cereal, muffins, danishes, fruit, coffee and juice available for a few hours included in your rate. For about $70 (with an AAA discount) it was a good value.

There are new owners and it looks like most of the renovations are complete. The picture DOES NOT look like the motel. The motel looks better. I had great service and my room was excellent. I guess this place has been a ""work in progress"" over the last year and it has been paying off. Breakfast was good. Only thing that stood out was a waffle machine. Everything else was the usual for motel breakfasts The actual design of the breakfast room was impressive. Internet signal was above par compared to other motels Ive stayed at. Definitely high speed but I did have trouble figuring out how to enter the password. Location is hard to get to off the freeway the first time but still in a good neighborhood.

realnunes,675889,"When we booked it we knew it was an apartament, not a HOTEL. So we went prepared. The apartaments are very nice, big, good kitchen, good bed. The bathroom is great. You have to ""rent"" the kitchen equipments, but it's refundable. There's a great supermarket nearby and a place to get fresh fruits too. Overall it's a good place to stay, the only problem I had was with the location. It's quite far from the subway station, you have to walk a good 15-20 minutes. On the first days it's ok, but we had already gone to Rome and we were a bit tired. Another problem was the internet. Very expensive and there's no place nearby to access. I had to use payphone to call Brazil. So, if you don't like walking, I don't recommend it, but it's a good place to stay for the price you pay. As a young Brazilian couple we wanted a nice place to stay, near some kind of public transportation. We booked this hotel through our travel agency and we didn't regret it. The hotel is not fancy, but is really good. The room is quite big, great bathroom, TV and heater were working properly. We absolutely LOVED breakfast, lots of good things to eat. We didn't have any problems with the staff, but not staying too much around the hotel. It's near a train station that comes from the airport and the subway station is just a few blocks from there. If you're not totally lazy, you're not going to find it hard to walk to the subway. There's also a bus stop near the hotel, on the main street. And across the street there's a nice restaurant called Pastarito. I think it's a restaurant chain. The food is good and cheap. I would totally recommend the hotel.","1 .- A sign saying ""Beware of rats"" as you enter the portal ... the smell of garbage as you can imagine, plus the urine of rats ... rising from the courtyard (where you can hear the rats fight all night) to the room. 2 .- A note written in marker on the wall of one of the stairs saying ""Beware of the spilled oil, which was the best of the ascent to the House, it was filthy and smell so bad that I have described. 3 .- An unbearable noise from outside in the other room that came from outside, ie, the insulation of windows (which worked) was zero, so the rest was impracticable. 4 .- The sheets (whose brush with the body is unfortunate because I do not know the material that may be made) had hair of other people, which says a lot about cleaning the apartment. 5 .- The attention to such complaints was received late, inadequate and cowardly, as not content with having RATS, argue that when they meet in the building and not the actual apartment, not do anything about it ... as if it were not enough to enter that place full of hair, odors and noise. When we booked it we knew it was an apartament, not a HOTEL. So we went prepared. The apartaments are very nice, big, good kitchen, good bed. The bathroom is great.

I had to use payphone to call Brazil. So, if you don't like walking, I don't recommend it, but it's a good place to stay for the price you pay. I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The only reason I chose to stay here was that they offered really good room rates when I checked - 40 euros a night for 2 people (20 euros per person - that's even cheaper than a hostel!). The pros of staying here: good value for money, very spacious and reasonably clean rooms, well-equipped with a flat screen TV, fridge, a sofa set, a kitchenette, a comfortable double bed, 1 WC, 1 three-piece bathroom, fresh towels and linen, complimentary shampoo - just like any other average hotels. There is also a supermarket closeby. Staff were not particularly friendly but good enough. The cons: it is very far from the city centre which i suppose is fair enough considering the room rates, but it is not as close to the metro stop as mentioned, probably have to walk more than 15 minutes. It is located in a rather dodgy area - definitely don't recommend coming back late at night unless travelling in a group. The swimming pools were disgusting. I know they were not open for use when we went but they definitely were not great sights. Water was dirty and there were moulds/fungi all over! Sold to us as a hotel with breakfast and swimming pool. Reality - wrong, just about and wrong again! This is not a hotel, at best self catering apartments, but in reality it is a housing block with people living there and a few rooms available for hire. Breakfast was included, but you really wouldn't want to eat most of it, and as for the swimming pool, well it had three! All closed, filthy and seemingly in the carpark! (See photo). Room was clean and well appointed (for a self catering apartment) with a kitchen, good bathroom etc, but did smell strongly of cabbage! The staff refused to allow us to move room, so it was windows wide open (which are totally un-child friendly as they open as wide as you like and we were on the 4th floor!) Does have a ""concierge"" though, well a man in a grubby port-a-cabin by the entrance, still don't really know what he did! Location - dire! Middle of an industrial estate long way from the metro, and not somewhere you would want to walk through in the evening! (Photo again) That said it was cheap, but we only managed one night (out of three) checked out, and moved to a 4* in the centre of town, worth every penny and made the holiday! Simply - Don't! Cough up a few extra pounds per night and stay somewhere central!",,,

I will stay here again when I travel to PDC. Nice modern hotel, cheap price (online) but a little bit far from the 5th avenue at night > 7 minutes walk through a dimly lit neighborhood. Free and good breakfast buffet = toasts, eggs, chilaquiles, frijoles, waffles, cereals, fresh fruits and yogurt. Clean and quiet rooms, with cable TV. Nice and helpful staff. Computers in the lobby. Just across the street from the 'long distance' bus terminal. We stayed at One Jan 2011 - the place had only been opened 7 months, so everything was very new and modern. It is located a short distance from the main strip, so it is very quiet. Free internet, free breakfast included (the breakfast is the usual local fare - fruit, toast, chilaquiles and beans, waffles, etc). Beds are really comfortable and the bathrooms modern and clean. There is a great tapas place just kiddy corner to the hotel, and it is right across from the ADO bus station so easy to get to. Great fares online - better than what they will offer you as a walk in so check out www.bestday.com.mx or similar sites for good prices. Oh, and there is also free laundry facilities. Great place - we will be recommending to friends when we have our wedding in Playa later in the year. This appears to be a brand new hotel with parts (perhaps a future condo complex) still under construction. The lobby, breakfast room and rooms are all very clean. The room was basic: a queen sized bed and that was about it! There was a wall-length shelf which served as a desk and also as a closet of sorts along with a small flat-screen TV. Walls were stark white. Bathroom was nicely sized, with nice large tiles on walls of shower and granite counter top. Free Wi-fi throughout. About 4 blocks from the main drag (restaurants/bars/etc along Ave 5) of Playa and 5 - 6 blocks from beach. Wal-Mart is one block south and a mega-mart one block north. Literally 5 min walk to all the action tho it does seem a little 'out of the way'. One of the two bus stations in Playa is next door but I didn't hear any noise and was not bothered at all. For non-resort style clean and cheap accomodation, there's not much to complain about. Breakfast included. Although this hotel is not located near to the beach, it is located directly behind the ADO bus station which serves Cancun, etc. The cabs in Playa are quite expensive, but if you want to walk in the heat or just take a cab down to the beach once a day it is not so bad! Esepcially if you are taking buses throughout Quintana Roo, the location is great. There is also not much noise from the bus station at all. At least, we did not notice any from our room 106. There was breakfast offered in the morning and although it was not the best breakfast I have had, it was certainly not bad. They offered eggs, ceral, toast and chilaquiles between 7am and 11am. The front desk staff was very helpful, and they have computers available for use in the lobby. The internet also worked very well in the rooms. Our room had a king bed and it was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean and they offered soap, shampoo, etc. We had a small closet, a desk area and a TV. For a one night stay traveling towards Cancun, we had a nice stay for only 45USD total.",,,
poca1313,217536,"This is my second review of this motel, we stayed here two years ago and had a great stay so decided to try it again. As everyone else says, its a typical beach motel. The location is excellent, only steps from the beach. The pool was great, the rooms were clean. I'm not sure if ""Lavon"" was the one checking us out and in but he was very nice to us, very friendly. We were also offered towels each day. Sure it could use some updating but as long as its clean, who's sitting in the hotel looking at the furniture all day anyway? It also has a kitchenette with a full size fridge. I recommend this motel to anyone looking to stay in OC who is looking for a clean place to stay on a budget. In fact when I tell people where we stayed, I've heard more than one person say it's their favorite place to stay in OC because of price and location. We stayed during the weekend of the St Pattys day parade. Its a great place to stay during the offseason because of the indoor pool. A couple small things I could complain about which would be typical of any motel but the most important thing was the kids had a blast. The kids absolutely loved the caribean key pool. Its in a great location next to a Royal Farms, 2 grocery stores and a bunch of outlet shoppping across the street. We got a packaged deal that came with a panera bread giftcard and two free passes to Ripleys Believe it or not which was alot of fun too. Rooms were very clean and the temperpedic mattresses were very comfy. Our room said it wasn't remodeled but it was in much better shape then some of the same priced motels in OC. It definitely was not the taj mahal but its a place where your kids are guaranteed to have a great time. We will definitely be going back, hopefully this summer. This wasn't the fanciest hotel but it wasn't the worst but for the discount price we got was were highly satisfied. Staff were very friendly, breakfast was great (more then just bread items), room was clean and beds were comfortable. Room had a slight smell when you first walked in but nothing you couldn't get over, and the entrance to the hotel is a little hard to find. But there is 2 shopping plazas right across the street and another one less then 5 mins away.","traveling with my husband on business so I stayed in the room all day for 2 days. Service by the staff was poor, our room got skipped by housekeeping the first day and had to call the front desk for clean towels and to have the trash emptied. Then we had to kill several cockroaches which is not a pleasant task for me. The management did give us a discounted rate for both nights, but housekeeping is an issue. This is a great place to stay outside of the city. We will definitely stay again. We have stayed at LaQuinta several times in the past month. I think this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. This wasn't the fanciest hotel but it wasn't the worst but for the discount price we got was were highly satisfied.

But there is 2 shopping plazas right across the street and another one less then 5 mins away. Stinky: Shi-Tzu I have stayed at the Laquinta several days a month for the past 6 months. While it is not a 5 star hotel. The staff treats you like you are in @ a 5 star. The staff have the over all additude that what ever needs to be done. its there responsibility to do it. ASAP, from the Manager / Front desk clerks / Housekeeping to Maintance/ Eng. The Very Best Staff, not even the Hyatt can top them.The Beds very comfortable. The facility and grounds very clean.TV could use some help ,that is with the Channels. Tom Tom gps will direct you to the front door. Improvements; Automatic doors for the lobby. This is one of the older La Quintas on the East Coast, and the neighborhood is definitely so-so. That said, the front desk staff was terrific and friendly, the room was very clean, with comfy beds and decent linens, and a new TV. The hotel has the usual LaQ breakfast with two waffle machines. I was in town for a cat show, and this was the show hotel, so they're definitely pet friendly. I got a phenomenal price via bid at Priceline, and was pleased to get a n.s. room with two beds. The one major drawback was that the entrance to the hotel was NOT well marked; both my husband and I (traveling in separate cars) got lost. I'd even called beforehand, but the desk clerk was not the person who'd given me the directions. BTW, I'd had a package shipped, and it was waiting for me at the front desk. Not one of La Quinta's stellar properties, but the price was good, the value was there, and I felt safe the entire time I was there. Incidentally, the desk clerk directed us to a fabulous local seafood restaurant. It's okay if you are stopping for the night. The room is clean and excitingly colorful. The beds are comfy. You won't find anymore amenities in this hotel but the breakfast is defintely a bonus. Elevator is old and looks unsanitary. This hotel is functional for an overnight stay, otherwise, would you live here for a long time? I say keep on driving to your final destination. I travel for a living so of course I've seen my share of hotels. Check in at the LaQuinta went ok, however when I got to my room, the counter and ice bin had cigarette burns on it as if someone used it for an ashtray. I had to use the laundry bag to put ice in because there was no ice bag in the ice bin...then the ice machine on my floor didn't work so i had to go down to the 1st floor just to get ice..The iron didn't work, and there was a stain on my bed.....i say stay elsewhere if possible Check-in was fine, the front desk was helpful and checked us in promptly. The elevator floors could've used some good cleaning and the halls are a bit dingy. Got into the room and was cold, so turned on the heater. The units are under the window and the window had a curtain, so when the warm air was blowing out - the air would blow into the curtain, which in turn would not circulate in the room. So, in order to get the room warmer had to crank up the heater. And that's when I saw the spider on the curtain! I first thought it was dead so didn't touch it. Then afterwards when I was sitting on my bed - I saw it moving onto the ceiling and then the wall!! Ended up killing it with my slipper! Didn't want to move room as we had already showered and were comfortable in bed. The room was shabby with an outdated tv. Bathrooms were not clean at all. Toilet didn't look like it was cleaned so couldn't really sit on it and the shower wasn't clean either. They should really look into what their housekeeping does. Seems to me that they pay housekeeping to do nothing at all. Breakfast wasn't bad - but it shuts down around 9am! So better wake up early to eat. Choices were good and the area was clean. The hotel is located off the freeway and that was the best part of it. Travelling from Nova Scotia. Was picked up at the airport - although the pickup could have been sooner - waited about an hour. Arrived at the hotel, where we received excellent service, room was good. The staff were very helpful in getting us to the light train so we could visit the waterfront. They then pickup us at the light train and drive us back to the hotel. The breakfast in the morning was good. The staff then arranged for us to be driving to the ship were we are going to take a Cruise. Wonderful front desk staff and Assistant Manager. For a comfortable night I have never been disappointed by La Quinta and after a day of air travel, some driving and sightseeing, was glad to have such a place waiting so as to unwind. Only complaint was that at exactly 9 a.m. EDT, they shut down breakfast while I had a waffle grilling, and made to feel hurried. Just arriving from the Central Time Zone and sleeping in after a hard day, felt they could have left their good breakfast up a bit longer for summer vacation travelers. Was concerned about my stay after reading some of the earlier reviews but all was excellent. The desk staff was super friendly and helpful. Our room was soooo clean. Even the bathroom grout was fresh and white. I was very impressed. The only thing that was lacking was a refrigerator and microwave in the room. As for the previous review about being in a bad part of town - no. There are a ton of shopping centers all around and everything was well maintained. There is a security guard on duty at night but, it is Baltimore!! It's not like Cleveland where you can't even get into or out of your elevator without swiping your key card. We were out until about 3:30 am to a concert and eats with a friend and even at that time in the morning all was quiet and the parking lot was well lit. I look forward to staying at this location again in the future. The staff on duty was very courteous and polite. We stayed for two days and the room was adequate enough to fit our needs. We had 2 double beds. There is no refrigerator or microwave but they do have and iron/w board. Also there is a TV in the room. The location of the Inn was fine. Right across the street is McD/Walmart/Home Depot just to name a few. A little further out there are many other restaurants and POI. We had our GPS systems and was able to travel outside of the area with no problem. We liked the cleanliness of the rooms. The bathroom was large enough but not oversize. This was a two day stay. If I had to stay longer I would probably stay in a nicer hotel. They do serve breakfast but we do not have breakfast there. I was not expecting much but if you are looking to stay in the Essex area you already know there is not much to choose from. The hotel was better than I expected. The staff was the outstanding part of the stay. They responded promptly and courteously to all questions and requests. Everytime I saw any staff members in the hall they smiled and said hello. The check in was quick and pleasant, the hotel is in a business park so navigating in was a little difficult at night. The hotel was clean, the rooms were VERY basic but also clean. We stayed in a king room, bed was fine, TV worked, plenty of towels, shampoo and soap only, bathroom could use a face lift. The carpet, towels and linens looked fairly new. The room had a small recliner which was kind of a funny, neat thing. The room was surprisingly quiet as we were right across from the elevator. Breakfast was fine, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juice, toast, bagels, waffles, etc. The fitness center is only slightly larger than a closet but has three machines crammed in there. I wouldn't stay here for pleasure but since it was a work thing only it was adequate. When calling the front desk about a question before the trip was not satisfying, didn't know how to answer my question or find my reservation. The room was very small. There was no fridge or microwave. I've never stayed in a hotel that didn't have a fridge. There was only one elevator and it was really slow. The location was good, but hard to find with my gps.",,,

I Had to stay one additional night, and change rooms. That night cost double. For business travelers on a budget strict budget the Comfort Inn Gas Lamp Convention Center is a fantastic value. The hotel restaurants and bar is a bit pricey. I couldn't find any beverage vending machines. It might be because they supply beverages in the room but they are too are expensive. There are no convenient stores in the immediate area. I would definitely stay at the Hard Rock, again, but for pleasure not business. There is no free airport shuttle but a cab one way is about $13.00 not including tip. Not too many of the hotels there have free airport shuttles. My wife and I stayed with our son (aged 2) from 9th -> 13 November 2011 in this hotel. It's a bit expensive, but still worth the money, cause the rooms and pool area is very clean. The rooms are very spacious, new and clean. Beds are very confy. The Wi-Fi network is fast and works really well. The pool is really hot, so you can swim for hours, the spa is almost too hot (don't expect to sit in it for long, because you can't due to the high temperature (107 Fahrenheit / 42 Celsius). Their parking is free and the complementary breakfast is okay, with different kinds of bread, cereals, yougurt and scrambled eggs. Next to the reception there are 4 computers with internet and printer, free to use and a gym also free. There are free towl to take to the pool. I do though still not understand american's love for carpets in hallways, breakfast-areas, lobby's & shopping mall's.... because they get really nasty... really quick, in stead of tiles that are easy to clean. This applies to this hotel aswell in hallways & breakfast area. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpfull. It's really close to the airport, but in the rooms you can't hear the planes landing and taking off, so it's not a problem. So if you've got a rentalcar this is the place to stay.

The room was comfortable not too small-roomy enough. The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced. The food was good. The room and facilities were clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very nice. This Best Western was an excellent value and one of the better priced hotels in the area. Also, if you're looking for the best deal on car rentals in the area check out Fox Rent A Car. It's a regional company and much better priced than the others, especially during peak times of the year. They also provide free transportation to and from the airport. It's just down the road from the Best Western. I am forever grateful to everyone who writes reviews in Trip Advisor---THANK YOU. Expensive but everything was very good.

Very clean and cozy. Check in was good. Friendly staff. Would definately go back for a stay. For business travelers this is a good choice for the Gas Light District. The room was a bit small but for the price it didn't matter. I was in on business for 1 night, working on a strict travel budget. Mattress comfort was adequate. The room was clean as well as the facility. Within walking distance to stores. Free airport shuttle and WiFi in room. Staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be staying there again. Be careful of what you select to eat from the grocery store Albertsons. I Immediately got sick after eating their chicken winds and chicken cesar salad.

I decided on the Best Western Executel. The room was comfortable not too small-roomy enough. The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced. The food was good. The room and facilities were clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very nice. This Best Western was an excellent value and one of the better priced hotels in the area. Also, if you're looking for the best deal on car rentals in the area check out Fox Rent A Car. It's a regional company and much better priced than the others, especially during peak times of the year. They also provide free transportation to and from the airport. It's just down the road from the Best Western. I am forever grateful to everyone who writes reviews in Trip Advisor---THANK YOU. Stay at La Quinta Inn Miami Airport West 21-> 24 november 2011. The hotel is booked 90-95 procent by latinamericans, so not all employees in the hotel speaks well english. Room is clean (except under bed...but it is always the same in all hotels). It seems like the hotel is constantly beeing renovated, the couple of days we were there, they were painting the hallways. Parking is free. The pool is big, clean, but very cold. Overall an okay hotel. Easy to reach - take 38 bus from Termini, bus stop 3, Piazza Fiume. We had room 402 which had a small balcony so we could watch the locals go about their business which was great. It was our first visit to Rome and it just blew us away!!! We bought a Roma Pass for 30 euros and it more than paid for itself - we got free entry to Colisseum and Forum cutting out the queues and hopped on an off buses and trains at will. We booked a Vatican tour online from the Vatican website in advance and it was good value. Note - if you go to St Pietro's Basillica on a Wed morning by about 10.30am you can see the Pope! We were about 6 feet away - just amazing and totally unexpected - the highlight of a great break. Over priced for what we got, breakfast was nothing special and the stickily floor at the breakfast bsr was off putting We spent 4 nights at the Westin and our expectations were met with a beautiful room. I would say that the front desk and help was low to poor - not really interested in our problems or our needs. This is an expensive hotel and one would think that morning coffee or free wi-fi to your room would be available. We stayed at 3 stars on our journey to Venice and got a lot more for our money. Also they boast being on the Grand Canal but I wonder how many suites they actually have for customers? All the reviews I have read people were all facing that darn courtyard - not a tree or flower anywhere to make it look nice. Close to train station, bus and shopping centers. Great location, nice large rooms with all amenities.","Great area! Plenty of places to eat, shop and drink all in walking distance. About a block from the beach. Our 1 bedroom suite was alittle more dated than the pictures, but they are clearly remodeling the rooms. Very clean and cozy. Check in was good. Friendly staff. Would definately go back for a stay. Beach Haven Inn is a cozy little beach motel right around the corner from the beach, my boyfriend and I stayed for four nights in December and we loved it. As we left we said we would definitely stay at Beach Haven the next time we were in San Diego. Larger hotels/resorts may have more amenities, however, we loved so many more things about Beach Haven, being able to park right next to the room, we loved the size of the rooms, a fully stocked kitchen with fridge and oven/stove, the separate bedroom and the living room with the sleeper sofa...it was all just perfect! It was quiet, had a pool and a hot tub. We could hear the waves from outside and walked to the beach at night to see the waves coming in, it was beautiful. Thank you Beach Haven Inn, we look forward to our next stay with you!! This is our 3rd time staying @ Beach Haven Inn. Haven't had a problem with cleanliness. Not too fancy but well appointed and awesome location & toasty hot tub- I love a toasty hot tub. The rooms are spacious & we booked the suite with kitchen; really nice. Totally will stay here again. If you want upscale stay @ the Catamaran but you'll pay more than double, although it is nice. This was our first stay but certainly won't be our last. We had an awesome experience at Beach Haven Inn. When we first pulled up the hotel it did look a little run down and I thought ""oh No what did we get ourselves into"" but to my surprise the staff was excellent, super nice. The room was clean and convenient, nothing fancy, just the basics. There is a grill that we took advantage of and a Ralphs market close by not to mention tons of resturaunts and shops. The location is great an the price is right. The heated pool and spa were an added bonus which the kids loved everyday. Bottom line If your looking for the fancy on the beach this is not it, but if your looking for a nice little get away with family and friends and want to go light on the wallet then this place is perfect. Don't let those other people scare you away. Stayed here with a girlfriend to be near family. Very lovely little place- yes quite simple but our room was clean & convenient. The bathroom was pretty outdated but everything functioned & was clean. The best part were the heated pool & hot tub- made use of those big time. Only thing maybe to consider is that the reasonable price DOES attract college folks & if it's a holiday week-end they can be noisy. Will mosdef stay here again. One of the front desk guys were very rude!!! Room was not cleaned... the place was falling apart... the pics on the internet are def not what it looks like when you get there!!! the only good thing about this place was the location was close to the beach... my friends and i stayed here for a fun weekend at the beach and wish we would have stayed somewhere else. i think the people who ran it may have sold their souls to satan. a group of friends staying in another room, tv was stolen. we were all at the pool bbq-ing and the manager comes up and says to the other people we were with that their tv was stolen. they didn't even know it was gone so how did the manager??? i think they have a fishy operation going on there. also we when we checked in the day manager picked up a spider from the floor and started to talk to it. we had not even been in our room for 5 mins. and the manager called us up and asked if our friend who was in our room was staying with us because we only specified 3 people and not 4. he basically accused us and then we had to pay for her. she was going to a wedding that nite but he did not believe us. they also called the cops on us becuase a couple of guy friends were hanging out in our room for bit in the evening. the first question the cop asked was if we had boys in the room. it was ridiculous. before we left i took pics of the room to make sure they did not accuse us of messing up the place. the worst hotel experience of my life. We stayed here for one night, on a road trip and had minimal time to look around the area. The room was great - large, huge beds, clean, the pool was a lovely treat after a hot day driving. There were plenty of cafes and restaurants near by to grab some food and drinks. The beach is just a couple of minutes walk behind the hotel - and is beautiful. The staff were amazingly friendly, and when we left an item behind in our room, they assisted us with arranging a courier to get it sent to our next hotel. A great service - thank you!!. I would definitely recommend this place!",,,
ChicagoOrange,120813,"I really liked this property. I stayed at the regular Hilton a few times prior, and I actually liked this property better. Obviously it's not a full service hotel like the Hilton, but the staff is exceptionally helpful and everything feels more streamlined here. Great location as well. I was looking for an interesting place near the train station and city center. This place worked very well. I liked when I was having a bit of trouble finding the door, pulled out my phone, and their mobile site says in big text Ã¢â¬ÅIn town? Having trouble finding us?Ã¢â¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â¬â¢s touches like that which reinforce that they really understand the guest experience and are there to make it great. ...but it won't knock your socks off either. I stayed here a couple extra nights after a business trip. I was able to use my SPG points last minute. I liked being next to the mall and the train. It simply ""met"" expectations. It's neighbors are some of the best restaurants in Baltimore. It's right off the inner harbor. See the other review for standard hotel characteristics, but it's worth highlighting that you get free access to the Maryland Athletic Club, one of the best wellness facilities in town. If you're looking for a nice hotel, it's ""very good"" (not the best in town), but if you want a FANTASTIC place to get your workouts in while traveling, stay here. (Side note: It shares a front desk with Homewood Suites. It's one property on a single front desk, but two different hotels. ...that part's confusing and worth sharing.) The hotel was clean, quite, and compfortable with good service. It might not be the trendiest hotel you'll ever see, but it's very cool. I would recomend it for weekday business stay or a fun weekend. The hotel was clean, quite, and compfortable with good service. It might not be the trendiest hotel you'll ever see, but it's very cool. I would recomend it for weekday business stay or a fun weekend. I was fortunate to have a room fairly high-up, facing Camden Yards. Fantastic view. The hotel had good service, clean, lots of HD channels, strong WiFi, and quiet. As a loyal Hilton Family guy, it delivers everything I expect as the primary Hilton in town. I look forward to staying here again when possible. The hotel was clean, quite, and compfortable with good service. It might not be the trendiest hotel you'll ever see, but it's very cool. I would recomend it for weekday business stay or a fun weekend. Beggers can't be choosers when you're traveling with pets, but when the Country Inn across the parking lot turned us away because of our dog (which we had mentioned in our reservation), this place worked fine as a backup. It's not the greatest motel, but it's was half the price of the Country Inn across the parking lot. And since all we needed was a bed for a stop-over, it worked fine. This is not a place I would recommend for multiple nights. But if you're looking for a bed right off the highway at the ""Crossroads of America"" it works. The hotel was clean, quite, and compfortable with good service. It might not be the trendiest hotel you'll ever see, but it's very cool.

Don't read into my review too much as we didn't stay here (It's not so much a '3' as it is an 'NA' and an FYI). We normally stay at Country Inns because most allow pets. We started to assume that all do, as we've stayed at number of them throughout the Midwest. However, despite putting it in our reservation, we didn't learn that this location did not accept pets until after we checked in. So if you are traveling with pets, go with the Quality Inn across the parking lot. If you're not, than this Country Inn should be a bit cleaner, as they don't have to worry about cleaning-up after pets. The whole pre-experience stay was very confusing. Why Marriott Corporate has two brands on the same property, is odd. It kind of makes sense once youÃ¢â¬â¢re there, but it just creates a lot of confusion before your stay. I was there on business for a client who had an event at the Ritz, but my room was at the JM Marriot. I called to inquire about my room at the Ritz for the event, and they said IÃ¢â¬â¢m at the JW Marriot. In hind-sight, it makes sense. But they are really screwing-up the pre-stay experience, and why they have a 4-out-of-5 in my book. The room, service, stay, and location were terrific. But IÃ¢â¬â¢m not sure why they are trying to cram-in two brands around the same experience. If it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t for my room key, I wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t even know where to post this entry on Trip Advisor. I hope this entry helps others understand a potential confusing situation. The hotel was clean, quite, and compfortable with good service. It might not be the trendiest hotel you'll ever see, but it's very cool. I would recomend it for weekday business stay or a fun weekend.","The staff was very nice, however the rooms were a big disappointment. They need updated, ceilings were ""cobbwebbie"", mattress lumpy, pillowcases wrinkled, smelled of cigarette smoke, even though ""no smoking"" rooms. Breakfast was nice and food good. Pick another place. Customer service was great. The hotel needs help. Year after year we stay because we like Country Inn & Suites but every year it gets worse. It is advertised on the outside of the building that they have an indoor pool but they donât tell you it feels like ice. The Hot tub isnât hot either, cooler than normal bath water. The pool and hot tub need to be resurfaced as you can see and feel bare ruff cement all over the bottom. The bathroom had mold all around the shower and the faucet and shower head were very corroded. It took ten minutes for the water coming out of the faucet to finally start to drip out of the shower head. The temperature control in the rooms is also very outdated. The employees are very nice and helpful but the hotel it's self is lacking! We stayed at this problem Thanksgiving weekend. The service of the management and staff were impeccable. We were greeted when we walked thru the door and our check in was expedited quickly and efficiently. The layout of the king suite was nice and accomodated my family very well. I was less enthused with the fact that a lone long strand of hair that apparently did not belong to me was visible to me on a bath towel. How that was missed when placing them in the rack is beyond me. The pressure on the shower head wasnt great and it took a few minutes for the hot water to kick in. However, when it did it did its job. Breakfast was great. The area was clean and all utensils were in their place...no problems there. Ionly wish that the cleanliness of the room matched up with the wonderful service that was displayed by the management and staff. Our stay at the Country Inns & Suites, at 4225 Southport Crossing Way in Indianapolis, Indiana was THE BEST motel experience weâve ever had. No, we are not hermits, but we know great service when we see it, use it and taste it. First and foremost, the entire staff was efficient, engaging and eager to serve at every turn. They made us actually feel at home during our entire 13-day stay. Our accommodations were clean, fresh and welcoming, while the array of breakfast and treat items were appealing and yummy! We are hooked on the Country Inn & Suites experience and will continue to recommend it to other travelers, especially, the Inn at Southport Crossings. I should have read reviews before booking this since I have to agree with what some others have said about rooms needing to be renovated and cleaned. The air filter needs to be changed, lots of dust. The carpet looked worn and seemed unclean. I am not a fan of the ""Grandma decor"" either like one other reviewer commented but in the past, I have liked staying at Country Inn since I felt they were a great value and had nicer rooms for hotels of this class. There were some good things about hotel, the breakfast had a lot of variety and was stocked and the front desk staff was efficient. This hotel is also conveniently by freeway and restaurants. However, I would stay elsewhere until they renovate hotel. We found this hotel to be dirty - carpet needed cleaning, less-than-fresh smelling, and just generally unkept. I absolutely would not spend another evening here. This hotel needs updating and more care to at least keeping the rooms (and halls) clean. First clue should have been the lack of lighting in the parking lot, and filthy entry way. Another big clue - I estimate only 10 rooms were being used - judging by the lack of lights. At first, we weren't even sure the place was open. I'd choose the new Quality Inn nearby. Good luck! I've usually had good experiences with Country Inn & Suites. Sure I've never been a real fan of the grandma decor, but still i have found it usually in relatively good shape. Usually (a good hotel) will update their carpeting and upholstery every five years and maybe even the bathroom fixtures if they have the extra funds. Well, this place ain't one of them. But let me first start out with the positives: There were no bed bugs. They supplied soap The breakfast was supposedly good according to my parents they have wifi they also have a computer to use in the front if you need it okay, now to the bad side: as i said it's in need of updating, not just the rooms but the staff. the place wasn't cleaned well AT ALL. I actually cleaned the tv myself and wiped down the screen which was covered in some kind of gooey slime, possibly from kids touching it or something. the towels didn't look clean, they looked like they had just been folded without going to the laundry. The sink counter looked cracked and the lighting in the bathroom was an incredibly bright florescent that made me feel like i was about to be put on an operating table at the hospital. The sheets on the bed felt like they weren't completely dried. The carpet was dirty and old. the heating and cooling system is in need of some filter cleaning which actually is really important because if you don't clean a filter you can grow black mold. you can tell the filter wasn't clean because you could smell the dust burning when switched to heat. The lady at the front desk wasn't' really friendly. For $89 dollars a night that is absolutely absurd. This was a terrible experience in general. From the room being unclean, the air not working right, the linen was stained and appeared to be unwashed, the breakfast area was out of most items with an hour left of serving time. When I complained to the worker on duty (not a manager-she said there wasn't one on duty at the time) I was told ""okay well I'll let the manager know your comments"". There was NO I'm sorry, or a follow up from the manager before we left the next day. I could not believe what a terrible time we had at this hotel. Nice clean hotel, nice location. Showing some signs of age but very well kept up. The beds were VERY comfortable - nice and plush comfortors! Excellent breakfast - wide assortment. The only problem was that the heating/cooling system in the pool area was broken and it was a hot and HUMID 92 degrees! Couldn't let my daughter swim too long because it was too overwhelming. They were very nice about it and called someone but it couldn't be fixed until the next day and we were gone by then. Very nice and friendly front desk service. We would stay here again. Down for the second year to attend the MotoGP events and activities, stayed here in '09 - a pleasant stay with no dramas, hence our re-booking for 2010.....so we checked in from a Thursday to the following Monday. What a difference.....hotel looked tired, worn and dirty. Granted, the exterior looks good but once you check in and get to your room...yikes! The bathroom towels - I use better tea-towels in my kitchen, small and 'transparent' (If you know what I mean) Room not cleaned on Sunday, beds not made and no vaccuming or wipedowns anywhere. The fresh grout job around the bath looked like they went at it with a shovel - clearly no care taken. Busted bathroom knobs in our room and our friends room - the cleaners must have noticed but obviously no one took action. Oh, and the dirty pool referenced in an earlier review, well that dirt pile is still there!...there was what looked like coffee grounds in a pile and never moved all 5 days we were there! - actually it became a bit of a joke amongst our group for our stay as to when they were going to notice it.....clearly the management do not study customer on-line reviews and take action. A bunch of other issues also, but I fear running out of allotted space here. I certainly don't expect the Four Seasons for what I paid, but like most folks, we only use hotels to wash-up and sleep.....not hard, just provide decent towels, make the bed and keep your place clean.......Sorry, won't be back, I believe I can get better around the corner. The motel was dirty, small pool with film on top, lots of brown/black dirt-like substance around door leading to pool, carpet peeling away from wall in room, bedspread had stains, ants in foom, conditioner 1/2 used, fortunately no bed bugs, breakfast area seats 16, one waffle maker. Stayed there for the indoor pool, breakfast and queen sized beds but it was definitely not worth the $139. Stayed here for a quick overnight on our way to Bloomington, Indiana and the hotel was fine. Easy to get to just off the highway. Not the newest hotel (furniture and bathroom fixtures showed some wear) but it was clean. We got there late, went to sleep and left first thing so we had a quick visit. Basic breakfast served in lobby.

mls_82,798666,"This hotel is close to Termini station if that is what you want, however most other areas of Rome are much nicer than this. The hotel is nice looking and clean. Reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was great. Rooms are nice however I would recommend to ask for another room if you are given one of the three on the ground floor next to the breakfast buffet. We found it quite noisy and too close for comfort to the common area. We stayed in a balcony room. It had a beautiful roman view and a lovely courtyard to sit in to share a bottle of wine and some cheese. Note you do have to walk up the last 2 flights of stairs for this room. The balcony is shared with the room next door, which posed no problems for us. We loved the charming old feel of the room and of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was very nice, and we appreciated the touch of espresso coffees. The hotel is close to the high end shopping street and spanish steps, which has a great busty feel in the evenings. The hotel itself was very quiet and we slept well. Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Close for walks along the banks of the river. 20min walk from the Vatican. Tip, buy your tickets online for attractions and go in the morning- the crowds seem to come out lunch time to evening. Close to the Borghese gardens, which in addition to the Vatican, was our favourite place in Rome. This was the only place I felt like I truly got to see how Romans live, picnicking and riding bikes with their families on the weekend. The best thing about this hotel was the price. This hotel gave us a great experience of Rome.","The rooms in this hotel are small, but clean. We loved the location (near Piazza del Popolo) and walked everywhere in Rome. The hotel has a charming cage-type elevator. A delicious breakfast is included in the cost of the room. Hotel offers free access to two computers for use by guests and we were able to upload photos.

This hotel gave us a great experience of Rome. Generally a good choise! Clean and comfy rooms, good breakfast but the best of all was that this hotel is 1 minute walking from Via del Corso, and 4' from Piazza den Poppolo and Spanish steps!! You can find many good restaurants in the area! Apart from being close to the Spanish steps, the Centrale is a few hundred metres from the underground station just across Piazza de Popolo. Buy a three day ticket (the machines are easy to use) and you have great access to the Vatican area a couple of stops away and, changing at Termini, to the Colosseum. The stations are clean and well signposted. We didn't bother with the busses although the three day ticket covers them too. Breakfast is surprising: lots of variety but the food is dotted around the room! The coffee is great, but I agree with other reviewers that the ersatz orange juice is a bit of a let down. The rooms are inevitably small given the age of the building, but the building is well maintained and kitted out. The showers are a tad small so if you are well upholstered a different hotel might be wise. The street noise at the front is evident but truly Italian. Our air con didn't work ( moved air but didn't alter the temperature) and the front of house staff didn't seem fussed. This wasn't an issue in November but could be a stressor in summer. The staff were friendly and helpful. The lift (elevator if you're from across the pond) is classic old Europe: small with spy movie sliding grille doors. On closer inspection it seems well looked after. Beware the occasional idiot that leaves it on the top floor with the doors open so it can't be called to the ground floor. This is a characterful, memorable small hotel in a great location for tourists. It is in a very safe area. I would heartily recommend it to anyone wishing to see Rome who doesn't want to stay in a corporate clone hotel. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and were very happy with our stay. We got to the hotel at 11am the first day and were told we'd need to wait until 3pm to check in. A few minutes later, they told us that they had a room for us after all. We got in the elevator (which was extremely old looking and didn't feel like it would be able to lift our weight) and went to our room. The room was really nice and much larger than what we were expecting. The bathroom had a full tub with a glass door which only extended half way (so the other half of the tub had no door at all). This made for very messy showers and water went absolutely everywhere. The bathroom also had a toilet whose seat was not the same size as the toilet itself, and a bidet. The main room was nice with high ceilings. The room was also all digital (lights would stay on when you put your room key card into a slot and press the light button). We liked it a lot, though it took us a little while to figure it out. The hotel provided free internet which worked pretty well. The only thing is that we had to specifically ask for the internet username & password - they weren't provided to us automatically. I think this might have been a mistake on the hotel staff's part (or possibly a result of our checking in early). the hotel was about 5 minutes walk from the Spanish Steps. We were really happy with the location and would definitely stay there again. Went to Rome with a gal pal for a few days, and booked into the Centrale as it seemed like a good price. Firstly, the location is unbeatable. Just a couple of minute's stroll from Piazza de Popolo, and the Spanish Steps, sandwiched in a small street between the main Via Corsa and some of the smartest designer shopping streets. From there, we walked everywhere including to the Colosseum and The Vatican, but it's also close to a metro station. Secondly, the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly, with good English. Thirdly, a good continental style breakfast with plenty of rolls and croissants, fruit, cereals etc. They serve till 10am so you can have a nice lie in and still get your breakfast! Fourthly, the rooms whilst on the snug side, were inpeccably clean with plenty of wardrobe space, and extremely comfy beds with good quality sheets and pillow cases, plus very effective air conditioning ( which you seem to have to pay extra for in other ""budget"" Rome hotels). Overall, we felt that the Centrale represented extremely good value for money in what is a very expensive city, hotel wise. It was a terrific base for our 4 day holiday and I would certainly go back and stay there again. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Centrale last May. We were actually more than satisfied with the amenities the hotel offered, mainly because we were expecting something less. A look at the pictures in the hotel's website gave us the impression that it is a very old hotel. In reality, it was a newly renovated small, homey, comfortable, accessible hotel. Location is perfect. So near the tourist and shopping spots, yet not near enough to be too noisy. Rooms were bit small, but layout certainly very efficient. Bathroom is kinda cute too, but since we're not of big build, we could fit in comfortably. Staff was most friendly and very helpful at giving advice. Metro station is very near. Several good restos within the vicinity. We had a really good time. Without doubt, we would recommend this hotel to our friends! Keep up the good work. It was more expensive than others in walking distance and offered far less in service, breakfast. Although my room was larger than expected the double bed for which I was paying was only two single beds pushed together and covered by a double sheet. The divide was very noticeable so I still only had the use of a single. Breakfast was okay, enough said. I have often read ""the shower was tiny"" well now I know what they meant. I could not bend down, I had to squat to pick up my toiletries. Okay I am 6.3' so maybe I'm picky. I also experienced an onslaught of bites around my ankles. Not sure what they were but they itches like crazy. My husband and I stayed in Rome for two nights. This hotel was within waliking distance from every sight. It was very clean and the front staff was extememly helpful. The only down fall of this hotel was the size of the bathroom it was very small but did the job. I would recomend this hotel to my friends. Clean and quiet location, breakfast was good. Beds were a bit hard but that is probably the same for most Rome hotels. Very close to everything and staff were helpful. Excellent location close to all the main attractions. We found our room although not large it was comfortably sized and clean. The same to be said about the bathroom. Loved the shower. One night we came in late (we were in Rome for an event) we asked on reception if we could get a coffee, not only did we get a much wanted coffee we also got danish pastries, a lovely gesture. I really do not have a bad word to say about this hotel or the marvellous staff. Two nitpicks, then to the compliments. #1 - the comforter had two spots on it. It was promptly changed upon request. #2 -Bed sheet quality are not those of the US but I think that is being a little too picky. The place is clean with the exception of the comforter incident, which was promptly resolved. HUGE rooms for European standards. Bathroom was huge, too. Breakfast was good. The meat quality was A+. The prosciutto was awesome The market next door is great place to pick up daily fruit, water, and pack a sandwich. That part was key for us since you can pay ridiculous lunch prices in the toursity spots. Location is closer to Piazza di Popolo than Spanish Steps, so take that Metro stop instead of Spagna. In retrospect, I wish we stayed a little closer to the Pantheon or Piazza Navona, which is more centrally located, and closer to the nightlife of Trastevere. But if you want to be near some fancy shopping and the Spanish Steps, this is a great spot.",,,
Mikkel G,301537,"We stayed here for 3 days while we were in Singapore. It was great, we were there at Christmas time so it was very busy, a little expensive though. Its right near Orchard Rd, where everything is. Also, a huge food court right behind the hotel. Nice hotel, clean rooms, good pool and fitness room. Very friendly helpful staff, I requested a screwdriver for a remote and an engineer was there within minutes. Would recommend. We stayed at the Ramee Hotel in Dubai after looking at it on Expedia. The pictures in the ad showed a very nice hotel, and they claim its a 4 star, so we paid $100 USD per night, As soon as we walked into our room we were horrified. The first thing was the smell. It reeked of some kind of cooking so bad, and they kept spraying air fresheners, which probably made it worse. It was also the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in. All the couches and chairs were stained and had things caked onto them, they were also extremely uncomfortable. They put clean sheets on the fold out couch and I still didn't want to sleep on it because the part where my head went was so dirty. The floors had visible splatter marks all over them, and were sticky, The cabinets were all super sticky, and literally had red sauce splattered all over them. The handles were super sticky. The bathrooms had no towels or toilet paper, and they smelled horrible and weren't cleaned. The roof is full of mold. Also, the internet, which costs $15 USD per night is sooooo slow. This place in my opinion is a dump. The only good thing is that there is allot of restaurants around, and its only 15-20 minutes from the airport and the Burj Khalifa. Would NOT recommend.","We stayed at the Ramee Hotel in Dubai after looking at it on Expedia.

The only thing I liked of this hotel was the bed, everything else was terrible.. It's not clean as you would expect from a 4 star hotel; Staff is very rude and can't even speak a good English; The location is bad: far from everything and it's just in front of a Mosque, that transmits prayers 24/7 from giant speakers..very annoying when you're trying to sleep! Worst toilet I've ever seen, and I've been travelling for months sleeping in hostels everywhere.. I would definitively not come back to this hotel, and I would not come back to Dubai either.. Stayed there at the end of April. The staff were helpful and front desk staff were kind enough to allow me early check-in and late checkout. Thats where the GOOD ends. The BAD - as soon as i entered the hotel, i could smell this pungent smell of cooking food which came from the restaurant right next to the lobby. It was horrible smell and not an inviting one. Secondly on going to the room, i noticed everything in the room was so outdated and unbelievably old. Right from the tv, to the bed, to the sofa seats to the linen and curtains, everything was old. I took a tour to the gym and there too all equipment was from the 1980s. The pool was the only refreshing thing about the hotel. The hotel is situated right next to a mosque. Can be uncomfortable if you're looking for a deep sleep. Overall, although i was there for a day for a ""pleasure"" trip, and the price was inviting, i wouldn't go there again. Im sure there are many other hotels around worth the higher price,. We took a triple, the third bed was a sofa bed, with a worn-out mattress. Unfriendly and impotent staff: they gave an envelope deposited for me to the WRONG person even though my name was written on it. Bloody idiots Room was large, but bathroom was rather moldy. The water was only medium pressure and lukewarm. Alright for two nights, but not for more. They have free parking out back, which is quite nice in Dubai. I have stayed at the Ramee on four occasions and I have never had a problem. It is in a great location right in the centre of town and it is also handy for the metro to the beaches. There is a rooftop swimming and I have rarely seen anybody using it while I have been there, I find the staff are helpful and do their best for you. In short this is a cheap basic hotel with almost everything you would need for a good trio. I would recommend it to anyone. Best bed in Dubai. You don't want to get up.",,,
L L,2514528,"There's many things I like about this property. There are a few negatives. Positives First: - Love the location, close to airport but with a harbor/bay view - My room (on 12 floor) had a balcony facing the water which was very nice. - Club lounge on the 13 or 14 floor is very decent. The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment. There are decent pools, but I didn't get to use them. All in all, I would stay again, as long as I am not counting to eat at their restaurants. There is a starbucks at the property.

Simone went out of his way to ensure everthing was perfect for our stay. Thanks again We stayed at this property on two separate occasions. both times, the check in service was smooth and efficient. We arrived early and they got us rooms right away, before the check in time. Rooms are very clean. There are three adults in our travelling party and we found the beds large enough for three adults although two of the beds are two singles attached together for a couple, and they could come apart. If it didn't bother us. Like the Ac we stayed in Barcelona, this property also provided Free minibar that is stock with beer, water, tomato and orange juice. The fitness center provides water bottles even if it is small and the treadmill was broken on this visit. Unlike the ac property in Barcelona, this one did not provide snacks, tea or coffee in the evenings. For gold members like us, we are used to the extra perks and the ac property lacks the extras. having said that we were upgraded to a corner suite without requesting, and we're happy that the staff and supervisor tried harder and offered us continental breakfast in our room without extra charge in lieu of the breakfast buffet ( we paid for) we couldn't make because of an early flight. Checkout was a non event and efficient. Taxis are readily available. The property is seconds away on foot to Cuzco metro station, and Citibank. It is also within 5 minutes walk to nearby good tapas, restaurants and Irish pub. If you stay at this property, try the Tasca La Farmacia for a great dining and tapas experience within 5 min walk. The hotel staff can direct you to its location. They know this place well. the Cuzco metro station is 7 stops to the heart of the Madrid city! plaza de espana. It's only 10-15 euros by taxi to the Madrid regional Atocha renfe train station, and 20 to 25 euros to airport. Wifi is free in the lobby and free in the room for gold members. all in all, a couple of lacking perks for gold members but overall excellent property.","We go to London every year for theatre. And while we love the ability to walk from Regency House to every theatre on the West End (and every place in Bloomsbury)â¦.and love the fact that the Underground is two blocks away going absolutely everywhere in Londonâ¦.what we love best about Regency House is coming home to it every night. It really is the perfect combination of hotel, with welcoming staff, cheery morning breakfast, and haven. We love it. And recommend it. Highly. The Regency House B and B at 71 Gower St. is a wonderful place to stay. It's intimate, reasonably priced. Great breakfast, caring staff. Ask for a room at the rear--overlooking the garden, which is not a thing of beauty but at least it's spacious green and quiet. We booked a nights stay at the regency house hotel as we were seeing a show at the pheonix theatre. Found the hotel easily from the tube station. (only about 5-10 mins walk from goodge street station). Check in was quick, simple and then found our room. It was exactly as we expected, and exactly all we wanted. Clean floor, sheets, and bathroom. Upon waking the next day, the only mistake made was that we thought breakfast would be between 7-10. Please note this is not the case. It's actually 7.30-9. Despite coming down at 9.40 one of the kind staff cooked us both a full English, with plenty of toast, tea and orange juice. My partner and I thought this was especially good as some places we have been to, refuse to serve you if your late. I am surprised by some of the negative reviews on here for this hotel. Yes it's not the ritz but considering the charge for the room per night with breakfast included, and the location think this hotel is very much worthing visiting and worth the money. If ever attending a show or in this area again would defiantly stay here and recommend to others. Stayed here in the last week and it was disappointing. Nice entrance and easy check-in. Once i got too my room it was the pits. Very small and the floor creaked every step i made which drove me mad. Bathroom was very small and the bed was awful. Mattress slopped down on one side so i felt i was going to fall out of bed. So not alot of sleep. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. I will not stay here again thats for sure. This B&B was average with a clean room, small bath, hardy breakfast. When I went to check out my bill was automatically converted to USD with a fee and owner determined rate of conversion. I was given an estimate to check but the conversion was in small print. I would have liked a chance to not convert. One of many Georgian houses on Gower Street that are now small hotels, usually with very small rooms. Staff at Regency House were friendly and helpful, but hotel lacked most amenities--no lounge, no computer for guest use, no air conditioning (and Gower Street is very noisy. when windows are open.) On the plus side, location is great and price is right. We found this traditional London hotel to be very good value for money given its facilities and location. Although the pictures on the net slightly flattered the interior of the hotel and the carpets had seen better days, our room on the top floor was large, clean enough and surprisingly comfortable. The bed was a super-double size and we enjoyed a very good night's sleep. There was a TV with a limited choice of channels (apparently DigitAl has yet to reach this part of the capital!), but adequate nonetheless. The ensuite facilities were perfectly adequate for the type of hotel and some courtesy toiletries were provided. The staff were helpful and friendly. The cooked English breakfast was fine and plentiful. All in all a decent hotel we would happily recommend to friends who need a place to stay in the city. I arrived to find the hotel scruffy & dirty. My room was the kind you would expect in a very cheap B & B. The room pics I found on the web site did not reflect the room I was put in . Give this place a wide birth. My colleague was also staying in this hotel like me walked in & then left . I had to find an alternative place to stay. I have never written a review before but this place was shabby !! and the breakfast area was like a cheap cafe. Very nice place! Clean, great bed, good pillows, nice TV, good breakfast, fast internet, nice bathroom with toiletries. VERY good location. Updated and pleasant. Definitely would stay here again. Price was 90 pounds per night. Not too bad. The central location in Bloomsbury is excellent â just a few minute stroll will take you to Covent Garden / Oxford Street / Soho â no hassle or fuss. I love the friendly staff - they always take special care to make my stay as enjoyable possible. The breakfast is generous & simply delicious! But most importantly I love to unwind & relax in the comfortable rooms after a busy day of meetings & shopping for a good nightâs sleep. I recommend the Regency House Hotel â as I will most certainly always stop over here. Our trip arrived a day early, so we needed somewhere to stay near our Regent Suites 4-bedroom flat on Gower St. This place had two rooms available, one being a family room with one double and three single beds. We had 7 in our group, so this room accommodated us perfectly. Richard was our B&B contact and was extremely helpful. The English Breakfast was amazing. This place is well lit and within easy walking distance to Sainsbury grocery, shopping, and downtown. Cheap cab rides downtown too. Warm friendly staff. Excellent value for a B&B in centre of London. The first thing we heard, once the front door had been released on pressing the bell, was a voice from the basement calling up to us. Leaving the narow hallway and descending into the rather cramped basement area we found a young guy in jeans who gave us a cheerful welcome and a key which bore a number that did not match our room's number. 'It's for security' he said. The problem with turning up at a cheap, non-air-conditioned big city hotel on a steaming hot day is that the room will have basked in the sun, and heated to the temperature of a sauna. Which is what we got. The room itself had a slightly scuffed, well-worn look about it, but was clean and comfortable, with only a few long black hairs among the clean towels to let down overall impression. We opened the window wide and went out for the evening hoping it would cool down a bit, and reckless to the security of our belongings. The night was still a hot one, and so the window stayed open. Unfortunately, the night staff seemed to have had friends in who talked and laughed into the small hours outside - not unreasonably loud, but just loud enough to keep a fragile sleeper awake. The next morning we went down to the the basement again for breakfast. Here the staff were delightful, and the breakfast which took you back to the old pre-self-service days was excellent. This is a hotel you could visit in cooler weather and feel you had very good value, and a comfortable night in a friendly place. We were just unlucky. This is one of the best B & B hotels in all of London. The staff is friendly; the establishment is safe and clean; and the location is superb (in Bloommsbury). The price is affordable and a wonderful English breakfast is served every morning. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! A+++++++++++++++++++ My fiance and I were moved to the Regency after having our booking messed up by their neighbours, the Ridgemount Hotel (I will be writing a separate review about them). Having read the previous reviews about rooms being the size of shoeboxes and the noise outside causing sleepless nights, I couldn't disagree more. Our room was a decent size and it might just be us two but we both slept like logs. Walls were a bit thin but this was only a very minor gripe. Service was friendly but admittedly we only stayed for one night and we had a clear purpose of what we were going to do in London so it's not as if we required much assistance from the staff. Since my partner and I were fairly restricted by budget I did a lot of shopping around for a centrally situated hotel with a decent price tag and I don't think I could have done much better than this one. Was topped off in the morning with a very satisfactory and hearty breakfast. Would recommend if you're looking for a cheap-ish place to crash but not willing to slum it completely.",,,
giemeigi,239489,"This hotel is in a walking distance from the train station, located is a really quiet place, which is good because is far away from the crowd. The room was very good, clean and beautiful; the bathroom was realy clean, with good towels and room service. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel really well located, but have to improve a lot. The first night we have to sleep in a room behind the reception, so the noise was awful and we couldn't sleep...the other 3 nights we sleep in a room that was OK... The pstaff as very helpful and friendly, but the structure of the hotel must be improve and modernize a lot!!!!","Returned to the Tivoli this past September. Located in S. Toma, just a 3 minute walk from the vaporetto stop, it is a great spot from which to venture out into the city. I would recommend reserving an upper room facing the courtyard. (Stairs only) This lends for a quieter room with a nice morning view through the shuttered windows. Breakfast is just fine... has an abundance of fresh cold cuts cereals, bread, jam, & a pretty decent cappuccino. Staff does a great job all the way around. Great support at the front desk, service and housekeeping as well. The main thing about this place is location & accommodation. Both are great...just minutes from just about anywhere... e.g. 10 minutes from the Academia, 10 minutes from Piazzo San Giacomo, 3 minutes to Campo S. Toma. & minutes from a great chichetti in any direction. Weather is perfect during this time of year. Would also recommend having lunch on the Fondamenta Nuove. Great views Murano/Cemetery etc... situated right on the water! Spectacular.. all the action is on the water, so its nice...no crowds. Ciao! I finally decided not to book via Tripadvisor as your prices for this Hotel Tivoli in Venice were higher than two other sites. Otherwise the Hotel was fine : we satayed several nights with four couples. Location is good. The family-run personnel is friendly. great budget hotel, in a great area, close enough to the train station to walk to the hotel, and if necessary drag your luggage over a couple of bridges. close enough to the the main tourist attractions to see everything, far enough out of the way to be quiet and authentic. close to some great piazza's to feel like the real Venice not just the tourist Venice. the room was clean and bright on the third floor with a separate bathroom, and over looked the courtyard. service was excellent, staff was friendly, and it had a family feeling. breakfast was continental style, we were up and gone by 6 am to see the sunrise at St. Mark's Square and missed breakfast....... the sunrise was worth it. We were able to store our luggage at the hotel on an early arrival, and on a late checkout. We would happily stay there again. www.jmeyersforeman.wordpress.com This is a lovely hotel in a fantastic, easy-to-find location. The room (a triple on the first floor) was clean, comfortable and a good size. We stayed here during a very hot spell in September, but had great air conditioning in our room. In fact I found myself longing to get back to the room when trying to make our way through the crowds in the heat. Breakfast was a typical European continental breakfast, but we really enjoyed taking our meal in the charming courtyard. Staff was friendly and helpful, happy to let us drop our bags first thing in the morning after arriving on an overnight train and use their washrooms to freshen up. Same on the way out, it was great to be able to leave our bags at the hotel until our 11:00pm train left. All in all, I would say this hotel is great value for Venice and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone looking to be comfortable on a slightly tighter budget. I recently stayed for three nights at this hotel with a small academic arts group from Greece. I found the lodging to be clean, neat, friendly and affordable in a city that is known for its expensive lodging and food. The location is convenient to all of Venice but far enough off the beaten track to be quiet at night. The breakfast is standard continental fair--nothing special, but nonetheless adequate for any traveler on a budget and wanting to stock up for the day and skip lunch. The coffee was also very good and the woman on duty took my order with a pleasant demeanor. The front desk was very helpful with any of my questions, patient with my lack of Italian and willing to go the extra mile. I recommend this hotel to anyone, solo, with groups, the elderly (no elevator) or families. This hotel is in a walking distance from the train station, located is a really quiet place, which is good because is far away from the crowd. The room was very good, clean and beautiful; the bathroom was realy clean, with good towels and room service. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Venice was the most expensive city we stayed in during our visit to Italy. We arrived by air and left by train. We wanted to stay IN Venice (as opposed to Mestre), and Hotel Tivoli fit the bill nicely. Breakfast was great, and the location in Dorsoduro made it easy to park our luggage, see the city, return for check in, see the city, return for a nap, etc. Room was clean & relatively quiet. Would stay here again. we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. it is a great location. 10 to 15 minutes walk from trainstation and to st marks square. the hotel was clean. the shower a bit small but that is minor. the staff is very very nice. would stay here again next time we are in venice. and there are some great restaurants near the hotel!! Great Location- walk to everything. Beds were uncomfortable but ok for a few nights- we had 4 twins in one good sized room. Somewhat noisey at night - but it is to be expected in the alley ways of Venice. Bathrooms nice- clean. Breakfast was minimal but great. Venture out to find the good restaurants !! In short, I would stay here again. Breakfast: It was quite good including bread, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee. Room: Our room was cleaned every day, it faced onto the street so with the windows open it was a bit noisy but closing the windows made the room quite quiet (I'm a light sleeper and had no problems). The double bed consisted of two single beds put together but this was something we had gotten used as it was the same in all other hotels we've stayed in while in Italy. The pillows were comfortable, there were extra pillows and blankets. Also, the room had its own temperature control which included air conditioning. Bathroom: In suite, quite spacious over all but the shower stall itself is on the small size. Room service replaced towels daily. Decent location, close to the St Toma vaparetto stop but in Venice, everything is within walking distance :) Over all, the hotel was clean and well maintained. Oh, and free WiFi which worked at a good speed. This hotel provided us with somewhere clean and reasonably convenient to lay our heads while on a short visit to Venice. This is about as far as I would go in recommending it. The rooms were quite small, but the bedrooms and bathrooms were clean, and the beds comfortable. Unfortunately, the breakfast was not as appetising as the pictures showed. They provided the usual continental breakfast, but quality and choice was very poor. Free internet connection was useful for pre-flight check-in. The air-conditioning was excellent, especially as we visited in the height of summer. Location was good - only a few minutes walk from the nearest Vaporetto stop, and only about 10/15 min walk from Piazzale Roma, the main bus stop. (The train station is just next door to the bus station, so again, quite convenient.) In summary, if your hotel is an important part of your visit to Venice, I would not recommend this hotel. However, if you just want a clean hotel at a reasonable price, where you can just sleep between sight-seeing days, then Hotel Tivoli is fine. I researched and emailed probably 30 - 50 hotels and this was the best value for a hotel on the island. It was only 58 euros and included breakfast and air conditioning. The shared bathroom was a much better experience than I expected. It was clean and I never had to wait to use it. There are sinks in the room so that was helpful. The rooms however were pretty small and outdated. The a/c wasn't super cold and the comforter had some cigarette burns and the walls had some smashed bugs. A new coat of paint would really help. I was happy with the breakfast. There were a lot of options. The computer with internet didn't work and no one could fix it which was disappointing. The owner let us drop off our suitcase before our room was ready and leave it the day we left but don't leave anything valuable because it sits unguarded in the lobby. This hotel was a great place to stay for my 3 days in Venice. It's located pretty close to the St. Toma vaporetto stop and is fairly close to several different sights that we visited, including Accademia, Peggy Guggenheim, Rialto market/bridge. The staff were all really friendly. The room we stayed in was a little small but still a great price. Plus, the cost included air conditioning and free wifi. The wifi was only in the lobby and patio area but still pretty convenient. Our bathroom was located in the hall, but our room had a sink and mirror in it. Sharing the bathroom was not a big deal at all, and I never had to wait to use it or anything. The breakfast in the morning was pretty good (cereal, milk, yogurt, different breads, ham, cheese, orange juice), and the staff brought out fresh coffee. Overall, this was a great place to stay. Pretty good location, reasonably priced, quiet, and just a really cute place with a lot of character. Also, it's located in the Dorsoduro sestiere which is a great place to just wonder around in general. I would definitely stay here again. This is a great little hotel, close to all in the heart of Venice. Super clean and comfortable. For a small hotel I had expected some neighbour noise, but it was very very quiet. It was only at breakfast that I realized the hotel was actually full. Breakfast was very good and well presented, sufficient variety for all tastes. Efficient and friendly staff speaking good English which is wonderful seeing I don't speak any Italian. Free WIFI which was fabulous seeing I needed to catch up on email communication. THe hotel also has a computer available for its guests to use. Overall a great hotel, definite recommendation, good value.",,,
esd3104,91462,"We stayed at the Four Seasons, Sydney for 4 days between Christmas and New Year's. The location couldn't be better for walking around the city, and catching the ferries, and the service was excellent. The rooms aren't huge, but still a nice size and are clean and up to date with a beautiful bathroom. We used this hotel as our base for a weekend to visit downtown Indianapolis without having to pay a premium for actually being in the downtown area, and it was perfect for this. We could easily jump on the highway and be in downtown within 10 minutes, but the hotel was in a quite area with some other hotels, set back from any big noisy roads . Lobby is new and modern, with the little restaurant being perfect for me to get my morning oatmeal. The room was your standard Marriott room and was clean and well kept.","We had originally planned to stay downtown but due to the women's NCAA games, we couldn't find a room. We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The room was nice as per Marriott standards and had a balcony (although it's right by the freeway so not much of a view). There were 4 restaurants within 500 yards so we didn't even have to drive anywhere for dinner. The room had a fridge and microwave for our leftovers! The free breakfast coupon got us a cooked-to-order, full breakfast with coffee at the lobby eatery. Our 4 year old loved the pool and hot tub! As for the noise, given it's next to the freeway, we ran the fan on low all night and slept like the dead! This was a good value within 10 minutes-ish of downtown Indy and we would stay here again.

Liz H,2514274,"Good hotel, clean & tidy and very friendly staff both at the desk and on the doors. Excellent location as right next door to MRT and some good food places also. My husband and I booked this hotel through trivago and I thought I was getting a bargain. NOT!!!! I made the mistake of not reading these reviews and looking at the pictures on the hotel website. It's NOTHING like the pictures on the website. The room we were allocated had a broken tv and a wardrobe that was held together with the side of the chest of drawers. The bathroom window was not frosted so everyone from the street could see us on the toilet. The walls and floors were filthy, the lights had no light bulbs, mirrors were broken, place held together with mastik, none of the crockery of cutlery matched and to top it all we found a used hyperdermic needle next to the television. I asked for a different room and that was just as bad. We got no sleep because of the noise of the traffic and there was no hot water for a shower. They said we would be given a full english breakfast between 8 - 10am and we was offered toast and jam or toast, egg and beans. We chose the latter and no word of a lie there was no more than 2 teaspoonsful of beans. The whole place is a joke. It should be given a government health warning, closed down and demolished!!!!!!","My husband and I booked this hotel through trivago and I thought I was getting a bargain. NOT!!!!

All the other reviews have already said it, I just wish I had read them before I booked, the place was filthy, the staff rude and arrogant, next time I have to stay in London I would prefer to sleep on the street rather than stay here..... This place should be closed down............. it`s not a hotel, it`s - a hole. I mean everything: rooms, staff, service. I stayed in a sort of shed at the back, hole in the wall filled with expanding foam, old fridge as a bed side table. OK breakfast was included but do the staff need to brush their hair in the kitchen area. The view over the commercial back yard wasn't great The hotel was ok I suppose. I went with a friend to stay there for the Scotland v Brazil game. The rooms were not in a great state with holes in the walls and a cockroach in one of the rooms. Beds were ok and my shower was ok but my friends was pretty grim looking. Close enough to walk to the Emirates within half an hour and plenty of pubs on the walk there. Overall we didnt pay a lot at all Â£90 for two rooms for two nights and we got what we paid for, No greetings, demanded payment for room straight away and was given a key at the same time as he was playing games on the company computer. When i did find my room, it took me 10 minutes to put the key in the door and open it. Inside the room all the carpets was stained, the kiddies wardrobe door was hanging off, so there was no where to hang my clothes. THE EN SUIT!!...woke a joke that was, it was stinking, smelly and VERY dirty. When i had a shower all the water went on to the floor and the toilet lid would not stay up!!!!!!!! I think this place should be blown up and will never stay there again or recommend this place to anyone!!! I was very disappointed to find that this hotel was not only dirty and very run down, but there was no saving grace. The bathroom was dirty and I would not have used the shower if they paid me. The room was grubby, the windows were draughty and there was constant noise from the 'shack' outside. The breakfast was a sausage, a heavily salted egg and a teaspoon of cold beans. Me and my husband left very quickly and ended up at mcdonalds on the way home. DO NOT STAY HERE unless of course you want some sort of disease... Well what can I say about the Shelton Hotel? The location is hard to find for starters. When we arrived the 24 hour reception (glorified shed next to most repulsive looking hotel I've ever seen) the man refused to check us in despite having all of the booking information printed to show him. He would not check his bookings and asserted that it had been cancelled (strangely I received no email or phone call cancelling my booking). The hotel was unlocked so a friend of mine ventured inside to find a manager. Upon which the receptionist locked her into the hotel and pushed another of my friends aside to do so. After we called the police (who were rather unhelpful) the thug that seems to pass as a receptionist in the Shelton's eyes removed the bookings list from his folder and rewrote it presumably to erase any evidence of our booking! Had to phone a cab as is a dangerous part of Islington and ended up paying almost Â£200 to get home. I would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone, it was dreadful. The night porter/receptionist/psychopath was rude, aggressive and nasty. The hotel looked hideous and they were happy to leave 5 women stranded late on a Saturday in a rough area. We are considering our legal options at the moment. Our room was very dirty. I've never seen more dirtier place to stay. The carpet was covered with ashes and cigarette, the bathroom was so dirty and never ever cleaned that I was afraid to touch something in it. The mattress on bed was covered with some plastic cover under bed-sheet so it rustling all night long. Break fast - terrible too. See photos and captions. A really nasty hotel. For the price I don't expect a lot; but cleanliness is not optional. The place was grubby, the bathroom basic - plenty of hot water is about the only positive thing I can say - the bedroom cramped. The tea cups were dirty. The curtains did not close, and the windows didn't fit, so the traffic noise was really bad. The advertised ""free parking"" is a couple of spaces on the pavement; very vulnerable to passing pedestrians. No local on-the-street parking available either. This was a thoroughly unpleasant one night stay which I won't be repeating.",,,
StCharlesLA,80154,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and it has many plusses and minuses. It has several very nice amenities that I have taken advantage of: the lobby is excellent for meeting and visiting; the handsome and comfortable bar offers premium drinks and beers from around the world as well as billiards and electronic darts for entertainment; and the in-house restaurant is just OK but quite frankly I give it higher marks for the variety of its menu and convenience. The rooms, too are adequate but nothing to write home about. Poor lighting over the vanity and low water pressure in the sink were disappointing; while water pressure in the shower was simply excellent. On the negative side is the exterior noise: rooms which face downtown must endure the noise of the train as it passes close by throughout the night, and rooms which face the bay are surprisingly blasted by noise as one car after another crosses over the ""temporary"" steel plates covering the street, which have been there for years. While the bay view might be enticing, the city view is equally attractive and may be preferable especially when considering it is sheltered from the afternoon heat and cost less than the bay view rooms. The location of this hotel is great for cruises and bayfront activities, but if you plan to spend most of your time in the lively Gas Lamp entertainment district or in the wonderful mecca of shops, restaurants and cultural attractions in Old Town, then the Holiday Inn on the Bay is not the location you are looking for, as it is not within comfortable walking distance for most people. I have had only had one negative experience during the 8 or 10 times I have stayed here - a major housekeeping blunder which included leaving my room unlocked - and when I reported it to the management, they quickly and surely compensated me to my complete satisfaction. To summarize, if you are looking for a bayfront location with an in-house restaurant and bar, then this is your place. This is a nice hotel in a great location in the heart of the French Quarter. The staff is professional, courteous, and helpful. Valet parking puts your car in a lot right across the street, available for easy in-and-out access at a moment's notice. Public areas inside the hotel include a comfortable lobby, a spacious restaurant, and a nice pool and surrounding area in the relaxing courtyard. The hotel's exterior blends nicely into the classic European architecture of the French Quarter. Of course, there are many choices of rooms and suites, and we loved our room. It had two beds and a balcony facing Bienville Street (See Tip #1 below). It was so serene...spending time on the balcony enjoying a glass of wine late at night or sipping coffee early in the morning; with a backdrop of seemingly never-changing historic architecture and a parade of ever-changing characters passing below, it's a great place for reflection and relaxation. Back inside, the room was adequately spacious, extremely comfortable, and met all our needs. There is a safe in the closet to protect your valuables. Tip #1 - When available, the hotel offers free upgrades to members of their great Priority Club frequent guest program who have accumulated enough points. We were thrilled to be offered this upgrade, even without asking. Tip #2 - Get their credit card, really! You get a free night at any of their hotels each year and lots and lots of points, which translate to additional free nights. You can't beat it. They waive the $49 fee the first year after which you can cancel, but even after that, the benefits greatly outweigh the fee. Tip #3 - It's just steps from three of the highest-rated restaurants in this culinary capital. Do try G.W. Fins for fresh seafood, excellently prepared. Do try Arnaud's for classic New Orleans dishes from a hundred years ago - very exquisite. Don't try Bayona, it is overrated and overpriced. This hotel is in in a great location, in tip-top condition, and has very nice ammenities. What's not to like? I have stayed here twice and my stay last week was better than my first a few months prior. That unfortunate time I had trouble getting hot water prior to a certain time in the early morning; the staff was unresponsive but I was extremely well compensated by management upon checkout. I gave them another chance last week and I was not disappointed in the least. The check-in process was fast and welcoming, and my suite was spacious and spotless. Between my two trips I have enjoyed the fitness room, the pool and hot tub, and the drinks and hot appetizers offered at the bar. Whatever problems they previously had with hot water have now been corrected. Just off the Interstate, it was convenient to travel in any direction (assuming you have GPS guidance), within a few miles of many excellent dining choices, and a truly delightful stay in every way. Housekeeping was outstanding. This hotel is also located a fraction of a mile down the road from the San Diego Chargers facility. The last time I was here I saw several of the players at various times in the hotel, and also had a nice conversation with one of their reserve linebackers at the bar downstairs. The bottom line: With its low prices, free parking, excellent facility, and good location, this is a very good choice for a pleasant stay. TIP #1 - Join the Holiday Inn frequent guest program. It offers many advantages and awards, not the least of which is free upgrades, when available. TIP #2 - If you are a light sleeper, request a room on the side away from the Interstate.

I had read about Holiday Inn renovating their hotels but I couldn't believe the difference. Before I would only be caught dead in a Holiday Inn had the title Express after it but I have completely changed my mind. The service was EXCELLENT at the front desk. I came in grumpy after a long drive and I was greeted with fresh baked cookies and a smile. Then, just because we are loyalty program members they upgraded us to a suite. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I was surprised to find that they had room service and a restaurant with an amazing breakfast. Plus a pantry for any little items you might have left behind. We didn't get to take advantage of the fitness center or pool which I was hoping to do but I imagine they would have exceeded my expectations as everything else at this hotel did. The best part was that with our AAA discount, our room was only $108! A steal for what we received. We'll definitely consider this hotel again when we are in the area. I travel frequently for work and customer service is very important to me. As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby I was greeted by the front desk staff. I was in San Diego for work and it was my first time visiting. The staff was very knowledgeable about the area and gave me great dinner recommendations and highlighted some hot spots downtown that I should not miss Ã¢â¬â including the Ocean Beach Pier. I had a busy travel week and needed a haircut and was not able to schedule one while I was home, the desk staff found a place just across from the hotel and even called and checked their availability for me. I am not always impressed with hotel food and typically dine out, however I did eat at the Rayo Grill a couple of times during my stay and I was extremely impressed. The restaurant had a very diverse menu: food was prepared to perfection and the service was top notch. I had a late night flight returning home and the hotel allowed me to check out late so I did not have to go to the airport early. This hotel is located just north of downtown San Diego and has quick interstate access to downtown without having to pay the higher price to be downtown. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I am returning to San Diego in September and I already booked my room. Unexpected treatment. First room we were assigned to smelled like smoke.. they moved us right away, even brought us a fridge and microwave. Free WI Fi in the rooms as well. Lobby, very attractive. Did think the restaurant was over priced for the food portions. Close to everything. I had the pleasure of staying at the Holiday Inn San Diego in Mission Valley in March of 2010. I would definetly stay there again and recommend this place to my friends. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Nice to know there are still good employees and a clean place to stay. We will be in San Diego for Super Cross this year and we as well as our friends will be staying here at this hotel. Thanks for a pleasant stay! I stayed in room 111 which should never be used. Across the hall is meeting room 110 that has meetings until 9:30 pm. Behind my wall is the motors to the elevators which run all night and out my window is a busy road. The internet was horribly slow, and parking was horrible. Almost every vehicle was over the line due to improper sizing of the parking spaces to make it appear they have a lot of parking space. If not for these major problems the Hotel would be decent. In the future I will not stay in this Hotel. i booked a room for family that was coming to town. I was very satisfied with the hotels parking, decor, cleanliness and staff. The hotel was very well kept and the room was nice and tidy, well stocked and they made sure we had a fridge and microwave in the room as we requested. Gerrie checked us in and she personally made sure that these were in the room before we got to the room. all of the staff that we encountered had smiles and were very helpful if we needed something. This was the second time booking a room here and the rates and staff make it a great place to have my family stay when coming to town. I chose the hotel because it was very close to someone that I was visiting. From day one the lavatory sink drain was clogged and the water just laid in the sink until I left, also the counter around the sink was very small and water just laid on the counter which made it dangerous to use the coffee maker. IMPORTANT-They didn't have a microwave or a refrigerator for use in the room. They had a restaurant in the hotel that I guess they wanted you to eat at although it was expensive. Fortunately there was a ""Jack-In-A-Box"" next door where I could get a cup of coffee and something to eat at a reasonable price. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere miles away from downtown San Diego, even the cab driver had no idea where it was. The public areas are dark and gloomy and the food is awful. The bedrooms however were acceptable. The hotel contracts out rooms to local shipyard workers who monopolise the bar at night. The feel of the whole place was very downmarket, would not recommend in any way, shape or form This hotel stay was very pleasant. Hotel staff and even all house keeping staff were very friendly and accommodating. Entire hotel was very recently remodeled so it looked, felt and smelled new. Room was very clean, quiet, and modern. Pool and hot tub were in very nice condition as well and are heated (hot tub a little too much actually). Great location - in the middle of just about everything in San Diego. The only shortfalls were the slow (but free!) internet and no continental breakfast. For a meager price on Priceline it was definitely worth it. I stayed this hotel in Feb. and it's pretty nice. Staff were great and the restaurant was awesome. Awesome price for room. Will stay again. This was the first overnight stay for us in San Diego (we're from LA, so usually we drive right back home). For the cost, I expected an average hotel in terms of decor, comfort, and cleanliness, but was very pleasantly surprised to find this place newly remodeled (very cute and modern) and very clean. The bed and bedding in the room was comparable to a very high end hotel (like the ""Heavenly"" beds at a certain hotel). The front desk staff were sooo nice and friendly. Didn't realize how close it was to everything, including Barona, which was only a 10 min trip. We'll definitely stay here again! Got this room through Hot Wire. Initial impressions were ok. Was placed next to a room with some type of generator in the room next door. Complained but was told there was no other room available. Couldn't sleep because of the constant vibration. Awful sleep. Would not stay here again. This Holiday Inn on Murphy Canyon Rd. is a hidden GEM! Wes the GM.is a nice guy friendly,TheFrontdesk Team are great&friendly.Micelle@the restaurtantbar is awsome!!! The wholeTeam there is GREAT!!! So plan your stay here when in San Diego.",,,

They offered an affordable alternative. No stove? Not an issue for a seasoned business travler with a crockpot! The room was very comfortable, clean and for the majority of my stay, very quite. The staff was excellent...friendly and attentive. Clean towels and rubbish removal every day. This is an older hotel, but well maintained. Oh, and close to every resturant you could ever need. XV Beacon's attention to detail is clear. From the well appointed rooms to the very helpful staff, all aspects of our stay were exceptional. XV Beacon is a lovely hotel! I'm a business travler.

The staff was excellent...friendly and attentive. Clean towels and rubbish removal every day. This is an older hotel, but well maintained. Oh, and close to every resturant you could ever need. The room was comfortable, spacious and unremarkable and the staff wasn't particularly interested in being helpful, although they did speak English. The hotel was packed with tour buses full of guests. The bed wasn't comfortable but the shower was hot. The included breakfast was pretty good. Our biggest complaint is the location--an overcrowded 30 minute bus ride from everything else in Rome. Considering how expensive Roman hotels are, this isn't the worst, but it's far from the best choice. The Rose Garden Palace is a lovely hotel in a great location just off the Via del Tritone which is a long main artery of the city. The hotel is modern, was comfortable, quiet, very clean and very well furnished. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I ordered breakfast from room service and it was great. I did not have an opportunity to eat in the restaurant II Roseto but I hear the food is excellent. The hotel was right off Via Veneto and Via del Tritone which are main arteries of the city, about a 15-min walk from Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps, as well as Villa Borghese which is a stunning park. It's not very close to the Vatican City -- you'll want to take a taxi there from the hotel. Or even better, ride the hop-on-hop-off open bus (cost 13-euros roundtrip without getting off the bus) which is only 5-blocks away from the Rose Garden (across the street from the Eden Hotel) and takes you to see all these sites and many more! The Rose Garden is perfect and enough of the beaten path to be away from the crowds, traffic, noise and hustle and bustle of the city. Small lobby/lounge/bar area but more relaxing that the fancier hotels. My room was lovely with high ceilings and was toward the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard and the outdoor part of the II Roseta restaurant. I expected noise from diners but it was very quiet. The hotel is only about 5-stories tall so it has a cozy feel to it. I would stay there again the next time I visit Rome.","We traveled with teenagers who wanted to visit University of Illinois on a college hunting tour. By staying at Red Roof, we were able to book two rooms rather than one at a more upscale hotel. The rooms were clean, and everything functioned properly. Staff was very pleasant and friendly. They had hot coffee for us in the morning, and every time we saw an employee, they asked if we needed anything. I would recommend this motel if you're looking for basic accommodations. no coffee pot carpet filthy bed like a hammock roadway sign gives one price but charged more I'm a business travler.

The staff was excellent...friendly and attentive. Clean towels and rubbish removal every day. This is an older hotel, but well maintained. Oh, and close to every resturant you could ever need. My hotel room was clean, it wasn't in the best condition but for the price it was about what you'd expect. The t.v. worked just fine, there were no problems with the shower or the sink, the bed was clean and made each day. At night the hotel was relatively quiet, the heating unit functioned well and wasn't too loud. The only major issue I had with this hotel is that I lost my key and had to go to the front desk to get a new one. The front desk clerk issued me a new key when I told him my room number. I had not seen this desk clerk before, he did not ask my name or for any form of ID from me. This was a bit disconcerting as, I'm guessing you could walk in and ask for the room key for any room and get it depending on who was working the front desk. My wife and I both went to U of I and return with our relatives and friends for a football game every season. This is our first and last stay at RRI Champaign. When we arrived at 4 PM, we had a fine experience with the woman at the desk, but when we went to our room, we found broken glass in the corridor outside of our room that our dog stepped in (fortunately not hurting himself!). I let the desk know and she assured me it would be taken care of. At 9:30 PM when we came back, the glass was still there. It was also still there upon our check out at 9 AM the next morning. Our carpet in the room, as well as the floor and wallpaper in the bathroom were filthy, and there was a hole in the bedspread. Walls were thin, and Champaign football weekends are noisy anyway, we figured that, not the hotel's fault. For the money ($105/ night), we felt we could have stayed in a much nicer hotel. I booked this room through www.illinois-hotels.org. It was absolutely the worse motel room I have ever stayed in for the rate I paid. The motel was advertising at the property 1/2 the rate that I paid through the reservation service. Carpets were stained, furniture was severally damaged, sink caulk was missing and mildewed and the lint build up on the shower exhaust fan was a month or more worth off accumulation. I contacted the management and the reservation service requesting a discounted credit on my rate paid and neither would take ownership and provide any kind of resolution for the poor quality of the motel. I would not recommend and will not every stay at another Red Roof Inn! i would like to say what a great mang and front desk people you have at this location. you dont find that much.ive stayed at other red roofs and they have not been so nice or helpful. they deserve alot. they keep your place running. you need to fix the place up and i know thats not the mangs fault . you have let this location go. sad to see.you should think of that investment.",,,

We have always been impressed with the high quality of service and the regular updating of room decor. Situated near the Etoile and the M1 metro line gives easy access to many sights and museums. The street is quiet and there are many reasonably priced restaurants in the area The Best Western Pergolese is a good hotel not far from the Arc de Triomphe - located at the top of the Champs Elysee. This hotel is good value, especially in the high cost Paris market. The staff made me feel welcome and the free internet was a bonus. They spoke great English and were quick to help me find some local restaurants to eat at. The hotel is located near the Argentine metro station. One of the best located and value for money hotels I have stayed in when working at the Palais de Congres. Staff were helpful and friendly. Room larger than usual for Paris hotel. Breakfast absolutely great for a quick bite and get away. Also very close to Arc de Triomphe etc. Will use again if available. very good hotel, very well runned, quiet, concierge very polite and atentive, 2 bloks from palais de congress, very close to arch triunf and champs elisse. best place to stay if you need to go to palais de congress Very nice hotel within walking distance of Champs Elysees and all the sights, close to metro station with easy transport to and from airport Charles de Gaulle. We arrived late without having booked in advance, but were lucky enough to get the last room of the day at a very good price. Service very good and room very clean with all the little extras that you would expect from a hotel in this price range. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location was great with only a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. My room was quite small but well equipped with a mini bar and towelling robes included with the standard room. Buffet Breakfast was worth the price. Wi-fi worked fine. No noise. No free breakfast. TI arrived at the hotel really tired almost in the middle of the night and was pleased to be checked in within 5 minutes. The receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was fairly big for a Paris hotel and the bathroom was quite nice as well. The location is great. A few minutes walk from the avenue Champs Elysses and excellent for a shopping trip. There are also a few Metro stations close by. Will definitely stay there again. This is a fairly good hotel for Paris and in a great location not far from the Congress center, Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. Rooms are a good size with a decent shower (very important). The only downside is I paid 240 euro for 1 night! I only booked the night before, so make sure you book early. Had a weekend stay here in November, lovely little hotel, very basic reception area, rooms are a bit compact, but the beds are super comfortable, and the pillows are the most comfortable i have ever slept on. This is not a very modern hotel, but it is very comfy. Bathrobes are provided also, and there was a bath and shower in the bathroom, shower was very good. Rooms were very warm. Mini bar also in room, but very expensive. Staff were very accommodating, we arrived off a very early flight so were at the hotel for about 11.30am and we were able to get into our room straight away so that was brilliant. This hotel is in a great location, 20 min walk to the Eiffel Tower, 10 mins from the Arc DâTriumph, and 5 min walk to the nearest metro to take you anywhere you want to go. Also lots of restaurants nearby and a delicious boulangerie right on the doorstep. Would recommend this hotel for its comfort and excellent location This hotel is very well located near metro and walking distance from Champs Elysees , is very quiet , clean and suits the classification of 4 star . Internet free in the rooms , nice and simple continental and buffet breakfast , confortable beds and most of all very nice attendants in the reception . Very nice hosts, nicely redocareted, rooms are fine and hotel close to the Arc de Triomphe / Champs ElysÃ©es. Perfect for a week end or even longer stays in Paris. Arrived to Paris to spend only one night, booked a single room and when I arrived I've got an upgrade to the suite...I had a very pleasant stay, location was great and the stuff is very friendly. Will be back! I highly recommend the HOtel Pergolese in Paris where I stayed last month. The location is ideal, 10mn walking distance from the Champs Elysees, with plenty of good restaurants around, and a tube station close by, ideal to discover Paris. The room are quite large by Paris standard, and the staff very helpful. The breakfast buffet is amazing as well. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel, whilst our room was small it was not tiny , the bathroom was great. We arrived in Paris when it was cold and snowy and the room was warm and after a day of walking around the city in the snow the hot bath was magic and a definate bonus. It was close to the metro and the food options in the area were good. The staff were so helpful and polite, one of the reasons i chose the hotel in the firstplace was a review that said the staff were good. I will stay here again. Stayed for four nights and found the hotel very clean and comfortable. The location is good being just a short walk from the Arc de triumph but in a quiet area. The staff in the hotel were very helpful. Would definately recommend this hotel. The hotel is located 500 m from the Arc de Triomphe and even less from the Congress Center, close to a metro station. It is very small, arranged in an old building with narrow hallways and rather small rooms but this gives it an intimate and cosy atmosphere. Nicely decorated, good breakfast, very convenient tea and coffee arrangements in the room. Extra thanks to the staff, very helpful, polite and all very good English speakers. We stayed for 4 nights (2 adults, children 13 & 11) mid august booking a family room with breakfast direct with the hotel. Hotel location is very good, a bit less hectic than staying in the touristy areas, felt safe. 2 minutes to Argentine metro but we tended to use Charles de Gaulle Etoile (Arc de Triomphe) station a 5 minutes walk away giving access to the metro or RER-A. RER-A took 2 stops to the Louvre and ran direct to Disneyland Paris (well worth visiting even just for a day, tiring). We travelled from CDG airport taking about 1 hour using RER-B & RER-A. There are a handful of restaurants close by, French one on the same street as the hotel and an Italian at the far end of the street. There is a shop (drinks, snacks, fruit etc) open till after midnight near the Argentine metro entrance. Hotel reception staff where very welcoming and helpful and all spoke English. Had some difficulty conversing with the breakfast staff. Family room was the main reason for booking this hotel and we where not disappointed. Two good size rooms with a private hall between, one double room and one twin room each room having its own bathroom, air conditioning, tea/coffee tray, television & free safe. It was much better than all being squashed together in one quad room. Rooms where spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Very good selection for breakfast, as well as continental choice we where surprised to find sausage, scrambled egg and bacon (if you where lucky). Only had bacon one day as it kept running out. Breakfast organisation was a bit chaotic, but we always left well fed. Highly recommend the hotel Pergolese especially for the reception staff, cleanliness and family room. We stayed here for 3 nights and greatly enjoyed it! The room was very clean and had all the necessities but a bit small. Staff was incredibly helpful and even booked a last minute tour for us. We took the AirFrance shuttle from CDG airport and it was quick and affordable, dropping us off about a 5minute walk from the hotel. Had a very nice stay here for 5 nights. Room was pretty standard for Europe, small room, small bathroom but very nice and clean. The staff was very helpful. Lots of cafes around, some very good. Very close to the Metro. I would have liked to be a little more centrally located. The hotel was in a very nice area but a little bit out of the way from central Paris. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. We stayed for several nights in the family suite which is basically a lock-out type of room where you have two separate rooms - one king room and one room with 2 twin beds. This hotel was very well run with helpful, friendly and professional staff. All the staff spoke English very well, which was nice for us. The hotel is very clean and safe. Staff helped us book meals at other locations and had our ride to the airport ready on time. We really liked the location. It is only a couple hundred yards to the Arc and more tourist area, but is in a quite location. Many nice cafes within a couple blocks that we enjoyed for good meals and wine at a reasonable price (for Paris). The rooms are a good size and the bathrooms are very roomy and good (particularly for Paris). For families (we have young and teenagers) or couples this seems like a real winner. We also saw business people at the hotel and all visitors and staff seemed happy.",,,
MrFredBahrain,304797,"My wife and I stayed at the Maywood for 5 nights and really enjoyed the experience. The staff were super-friendly and helpful (particularly when the hotel computer needed to be changed to an english keyboard!), and the hotel is extremely well situated in the old city with easy access to the top attractions (5 minute walk) and the Bosphorous sea-front. There are excellent restaurants nearby, and a great tram and railway link, and while the streets are narrow - and impossibly 'two way flow' - taxis do manage to get to the hotel without too much hassle, and nothing that a bit of backing up cannot fix! Our room (304) faced the street and only occasionally did we hear a shout. It had a tiny balcony, a small but adequate bathroom with an excellent shower, two single beds (they offered to move us to a double bed), but limited cupboard space, or a place to put suitcases (But hey, old is generally tiny!) Spotlessly clean - the only thing is that that don't provide a minimum of bottled water, even though they advise you not to drink the tap water. The breakfast - from 7.00 to 11.00 is humungous although the coffee was Nescafe!! Furniture in main areas is period style and fits in very well. A travel agent in Istanbul sold us a room at ""The 5 star Green Park Taksim"", as we were coming back through Istanbul again, but he sold us a pup! The hotel was very tired looking, gloomy (NO Management, low lighting can be romantic for effect, but that is not much fun when you want to READ instead and you cannot because the room looks as though it is in a brown out! Bathroom is tiny and has any Manager tried sitting ('h' left out!) on the loo and trying to access the loo paper! Mission Impossible! Open the shower 'curtain' - a plastic dual door job that came off the hinges - and turn on the shower and the floor floods! We had room 904, right next to the lift - which clunked all night - and the street noise and barking dogs continued most of the night as well. Breakfast spread was the worst that we experienced in our Turkey travels and the 'scrambled eggs' tasted (well the one fork full we did taste - was like chicken grit. Area around the hotel noisy and unappealing. Staff were helpful, but then they were everywhere in Turkey. Why oh why didn't we take the extra night at the Four Star Maywood - far less cost, and oh so much nicer!","In Istanbul 4* hotels can be measured as 3* or less comparing to Europe Ã¢â¬Â¦ so itÃ¢â¬â¢s not the only hotel below 4* prospects . Rooms where ok , but the bathroom and the shower were unclean as needed , the light is white neon everywhere in the room , even the table lamps which was so uncomfortable ,apparently not all rooms the same ! no locker in rooms , but you can leave your passports and valuable stuff at the receptionÃ¢â¬â¢s lockers which you will have a key for it during your stay. We stayed for 4 nights , and weÃ¢â¬â¢ll choose a 5* next time, the bed is not that comfy , there is a kettle , 2 Nescafe & tea bags which were consumed at the first day and they never supply another ones during our 5 days stay . Breakfast is fine but limited itÃ¢â¬â¢s recommended to have it somewhere out if your reservation can be excluded of breakfast .btw Elevators are very slow! Spa is average has a steam , sauna , swimming pool and Turkish bath better to reserve in advance. On the other hand the location is good ,10 Ã¢â¬â 15 min walk to main Istiklal street and metro station, located in a nice hotels area and taxiÃ¢â¬â¢s not really expensive .Service is efficient and Hotels staff are pleasant , welcoming and flexible . The position of the hotel is excellent to visit the city. It is very close to Taksim square where a lot of public transportation is available. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean; the wi-fi is free of charge in the room. The breakfast is good with a large choice of food. The staff is very kind.

Why oh why didn't we take the extra night at the Four Star Maywood - far less cost, and oh so much nicer! This place was great.....it is centrally located and if your old and dont want to deal with a busy area then dont stay here lol. We came to have fun and party and had a gret time. The hotel is clean and friendly. It is near bus...train and shopping. Horrable customer service,Horable wedding organizer(Plilis) Misleading,and never will do what you want and will surprise you on your day with bad surprises she already knew it before.The food you pay for is not what you will get,No WIFI in the rooms(Doesn't work),No AC in the room for 5 Hrs?If you reserve and pay for the pool don't expect to get it they will tell you it was windy althought it was hot and no breez,Just a compleet RIP OFF place,very rude staff , over all,NEVER AGAIN and don't do the same mistake. Firts of all sorry for my english... I am Greek. We stay at the hotel for 3 nights.... the rooms were not so clean... the bathroom was very bad... i have problem with my aircondition... for three nights i couldnt sleep. the staf every day tell me that they will fix it... or they will change me room... nothing... very unfriendly staff... the worst i ever seen.. One lady of my group he had a problem with her bathroom.. nobody help her... it was amazing how was their behaviour.... Avoid this hotel... i am traveling in istanbul every 2-3 weeks... This hotel its the worst i stay... the only good its the location.. very close to Taxim square... but i will never get there... one thing again... they charge the Wi fi internet, 10 euro per day... amazing... My girlfriend and I spent three days staying at this hotel. It is located in an area so loud that if you want to sleep you can not open the window and still closed you hear the scandal of traffic and people partying. Our bathroom was losing water and after telling them no one came to fix it. In addition, we request at our departure we required their shuttle service to the Airport and they charged us 25 euros per person, when no taxis or private transport services they charge per person, but for service (at least, if you are only 2 people). We left with a bad impression of this hotel and I do not recommend it to anyone. First of all I must say that I rate Green Park as a very good hotel for Istanbul standards based in location, price and cleanliness. Our room was on the 3rd floor in front of a busy street that after 23.00 gets a little more quiet. Room was big with new carpet on the floor and average bathroom size with some toiletries provided by the hotel. Breakfast was good with great variety of bread, cheese and some local specialties (scramble eggs with spinach! Not my favour but original) and fruits. Hot chocolate on demand and you had to pay. That's not good guys. Restaurant on the 10th floor was average in prices and food quality but has a great view in a part of the city. Gym was good and you could use for free the sauna, the tiny swimming pool and the turkish bath. Parking was free. I've parked the car outside of the Hotel, the bell boy took it (gave him a tip) and after 4 days when we left he brought it back again in one piece (gave him again something). The Hotel is located less than 5 minutes from Taksim square and the main pedestrian street, Istiklar where tens of thousands people walk every single minute. I didn't feel unsafe in the area which is surveilanced 24 hours by private security guards. Rates in the Hotel as in all Hotels varied depending the season and the celebrations. For instance we went on Easter period for both Catholics and Orthodox so prices were higher. Negative remark. Though we didn't use the air condition, we were told from other Hotel customers that it didn't work properly, so be sure before you go. Staff in the Hotel was helpful and polite and most of them had a basic knowledge of English language. You can't find this option easily in Istanbul. P.S. Wifi on demand, I think 10 Euro for whole day but I didn't use it because I wanted to detoxicate!",,,
rickscottOhio,284509,"My review does not deal with my stay at Mimi. We have styaed there 3 times and enjoyed each stay. The location can not be beat and the staff is wonderful. I hatged to see Rene leave as Mgr. His absence has led to a less efficient operation. My complaint deals with my efforts to arrange a vacation for 2012. I sent 4 differnet e-mails to Mimi Del Mar and not a one of them was responded to. I decided to look elsewhere. I hope to someday return to Mimi, but they gotta get their act together! We have stayed at Mimi on 2 occasions. I admit it isn't a fancy place but we have been treated very well and really enjoyed our stays. Our last stay occurred at the time of the beach restoration in mid January and although that was a bummer for everyone on the beach, they helped us out with an upgraded room and were very apologetic about the situation. The breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, juice and coffee is fine to get your day started. I have never been denied the breakfast or towels while there. Drinking water is not supplied so you must go shopping for it every couple days at Walmart or Mega for the big jugs. The location is as good or better than any hotel there. I have heard that the Manager, Rene Garcia, who we really liked , is no longer there and we will miss him. We do however look forward to staying there again.","We loved it. You can hear the ocean at night. We had many a happy night there drinking on the balcony. Walking distance to great bars and restaurants and local buses and trips all over Mexico. My review does not deal with my stay at Mimi. We have styaed there 3 times and enjoyed each stay. The location can not be beat and the staff is wonderful. I hatged to see Rene leave as Mgr. His absence has led to a less efficient operation. My complaint deals with my efforts to arrange a vacation for 2012. I sent 4 differnet e-mails to Mimi Del Mar and not a one of them was responded to. I decided to look elsewhere. I hope to someday return to Mimi, but they gotta get their act together! Mimi is still a cool place- (our third stay) but- Ownership is cost cutting and let the manager go - (Rene- a really good guy)-consequently service quality is down -overheard more than one guest questioning why they were not receiving the usual free breakfast, etc.--and Mimi -at least at the time- was only taking cash- they did offer pay pal as a way to pay, but it's all a little strange-several guests making trips to the ATM at check out time, Otherwise - still a perfect location and nicer,clean place to stay in P.D.C. Really hope ownership gets everything back on track- This is our third visit for Mimi del Mar. We like the location (literally right on the beach). To get there you ask one of their waiters to help you carry your suitcase across the sand. In the morning you leave your room and walk on to the beach to have a free continental breakfast (included if you reserve directly with the hotel). Then you choose your lounge chair (included with room), and relax for the rest of the day. The waiters can bring drinks, and their beach restaurant has excellent cerviche. About 4, when it starts getting cooler and the restaurant closes, you go back to your room, take a shower, and then wander off to Fifth Avenue, which is a block away. We did this for a week and thoroughly enjoyed it. PS- there appears to be wifi, although I'm not sure who is providing it. We love the Mimi. It's a great little hotel, the people are so nice and helpful. And the location is perfect. You are right on the beach and barely off 5th avenue you can not beat it. And the price is awesome. This is our 2nd stay here, we also stayed here in June 2010. And we are planning our return trip already. Raul and Pancho at the bar keep you covered with cold beers, great services, and great food. Nice and cozy little hotel. We were very pleased we didn't stay at some of the all inclusive-luxury-hotels at the River Maya -area. Here you can really see the Mexican lifestyle. The staff were extremely friendly. The location is perfect. Only minus is the sand which spreads everywhere because the hotel really is _on_the_beach. My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Mimi in January 2010. Fortunately our arrival date just happened to be a week after the beach restoration was completed. The restored beach was beautiful. We enjoyed our 4 night stay. The hotel is right on the beach, yes you do have to drag your bags across the sand, near the center of town and the ferry dock. We originally were shown a room on the 3rd floor but requested a lower floor because the stairs were tricky. The room was plain but clean and a good value considering the location and price. The free breakfast was very good and lunch on the beach was just fine. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will be returning in January. We were on vacation from June 11-25, we only spent the 18-25 at the Mimi del Mar, we really wish we would have stayed here the whole vacation, but unfortunately we made the mistake of booking at a local All-Inclusive in advance and couldn't get out of it. The Mimi del Mar was a far better hotel. The service was awesome, the location, the people, everything. The restaurant has great drinks, beer and food and the best waiters on the beach!!! Love, Love Raul and the other waiter they work hard all day! This place has lots of beach chairs, umbrellas & towels. There is bottled water and the rooms have really cold air conditioning and great showers. I had some fish fingers at the restaurant those are fantastic, the chips and salsa are always fresh and delicious too with a bucket of icy cold beers, you just can't go wrong here. The Mimi is located close to everything within to walking distance so don't hestitate to get out a walk-about. We had free wi-fi, had some trouble with it, but was able to be on the web everyday. My only negative was the bed it was a little hard for me.But everything else was great. It was our 17th Wedding Anniversary thanks Mimi del Mar, we will be back next year! This is a difficult review because the hotel itself is old and not well maintained but the room was clean enough and we had one of two oceanfront rooms with a huge, private balcony. We left the balcony door open all the time and had a breeze with the rear window open. It was quiet too. I don't know if there are other hotels with private, ocean front rooms and a kitchen for $170! But, there were tiny, tiny ants that came out in the kitchen if one little crumb was out and the kitchen furnishings were sparse. We bought dish soap and washed everything. You have to buy bottled water at this hotel but that was o.k. with us. The biggest problem was that the hot water was luke warm when we arrived and then went to cold and they even turned it off completely for several hours on two different days to repair. This was not acceptable service in our opinion and they offerred us nothing in return. You don't get breakfast included unless you book directly through the hotel but the one we purchase wasn't good anyway. We loved Playa del Carmen and this location on the beach. Since the beach restoration there is plenty of room on the sand and the small size of the hotel helps the beach area not be croweded. Bad Boys Beach Club next door has good food and the live music from 5-9 on Thurs. and Sat. was great! If you're looking for a no frills hotel in a good location for a good price, you'll like this. We had to move to the Alhambra hotel down the beach for one night. The rooms were much nicer but we were on a side street with noise and less privacy so had to keep the room closed up with the air conditioner running. I'd rather have the ocean front, quiet room at the Mimi. We have stayed at Mimi on 2 occasions. I admit it isn't a fancy place but we have been treated very well and really enjoyed our stays. Our last stay occurred at the time of the beach restoration in mid January and although that was a bummer for everyone on the beach, they helped us out with an upgraded room and were very apologetic about the situation.

I have heard that the Manager, Rene Garcia, who we really liked , is no longer there and we will miss him. We do however look forward to staying there again. The positive: Location, location, location. The reconstructed beach is big and beautiful, and Hotel Mimi del Mar is right there! The negative: When we checked in, the manager explained that there was a problem with the laundry and would we mind using the same beach towels for a couple of days. Except that we never got any beach towels. When we went to the front desk, we were told to come back later and when we returned later, we were told that we should have come earlier. We paid extra for continental breakfast, which ended up being white toast and watery orange juice. Not even coffee, as we were told the coffee machine was broken. There was no hot water the first two days and then no water at all. When we went to the front desk, the manager was nowhere to be found. Instead he left a memo explaining that, in order to fix the hot water, all the water needed to be turned off. When we asked about what to do for a toilet, we were told to ""wait, I guess."" When the water came back on nearly 8 hours later, there was still no hot water. And we checked out and moved to the magical Mahekal. We have stayed in Playa before and have always been impressed by the service and consideration. But not at Hotel del Mimi where the management just doesn't care.",,,
richard b,578261,"just spent 6 days at the seascape and it was great. weve been going there for 10 years now and have not had any problems.when a couple people got a little to loud the staff took care of it. they even came up to me personally and said if the people are to noisy to call the office. they monitor the grounds all night long and the pool was kept very clean and the staff is hard working. anything i needed they got me. the place is a little old but if you want it remodeled then expect to pay higher prices. as for me and my family we only sleep in the room and it was clean. we like it so much i told my wife next year i would like to stay for 10 days.thanks for a great vacation sea scape. sincerely the boyers. Stayed here in October,2011, for 13 days, and couldn't be happier with accomodations, and especially the helpful staff. Located about 1 km north of the main railroad station, and about 1-l/2 km east of the Borghese Gardens, this villa (built in 1900) was about 100 meters from a bus and tram stop, and a 5-to-10 minute walk to Metro stop. In a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood within walking distance of really good, economical restaurants, perfect after a long day's touring, or even a hectic day of business. Rooms called small by other reviewers were spacious by European standards, my pal and I moved around easily. Terraces were available to all, complete with chaises-longues, for relaxing in the mild Roman nights. The pricing for rooms was low compared to the dubious privilege of staying in the Centro Storico, or anywhere near it, any why bother when you are 10 to 15 minutes by taxi or bus, tram or Metro away from almost anything you want to see? The staff, again, were warm, professional and totally helpful with directions, including maps, making reservations, etc. I love Rome, and stayed downtown and near it, but I'm staying here again.","I know, I know most people will say that the place need renovations, yes indeed need it, but you can't beat the price and the location. The amazing ocean front location make it a very nice place to stay, anyway most of us just go straight to the beach and spend most of our time out of the room just get there to sleep and take a shower, so we don't need a fancy place. :) I am only writing this review because I am so tired of reading about people putting down this hotel, if you dont like it, stay elsewhere. Yes, it could use some updating, but it is a great location for price. We have been staying there for three years and love the location! The owners work every day and are great hosts! Thank you for another great weekend this year, we cant wait until we can come back! just spent 6 days at the seascape and it was great. weve been going there for 10 years now and have not had any problems.when a couple people got a little to loud the staff took care of it. they even came up to me personally and said if the people are to noisy to call the office. they monitor the grounds all night long and the pool was kept very clean and the staff is hard working. anything i needed they got me. the place is a little old but if you want it remodeled then expect to pay higher prices. as for me and my family we only sleep in the room and it was clean. we like it so much i told my wife next year i would like to stay for 10 days.thanks for a great vacation sea scape. sincerely the boyers. We stay here for 3 days, and were very pleased. First we had a lot of stuff to carry to our room, Jonny helped us unload the truck. My husband is in a band that had 3 gigs that weekend. Jonny was a great help to getting all that stuff to the room on the second floor. Great thing this place has a elevator. This place is right on the boardwalk. We have stayed here time and time again for over that last 8 years. The price has always been affordable. I have read some of the other reviews and don't understand what folks are looking for. We have never had a bad time here and are looking forward to our next stay. The price of the motel is very affordable and the people who work there are very friendly. The motel is located in the center of the board walk and you are just within walking distance of all the boardwalk has to offer. The motel is older...It is clean and everything is in working order.It suits our needs . We will be staying here again and recommending it to our friends.... We decided to go down to Ocean City for our first time ever and stayed at this motel and we loved it!! The price was really great and the people were very friendly! Our room was very clean and the pool was nice and warm! I will definitely be staying here again hopefully at the end of the summer. I would recommend this place to any family trying to get away on a budget. It is by no means a fancy place but it surved its purpose for us. Thank you for such a wonderful week! we love sea scape !!!!!! 12 years and many more to come !!!!!!! and the price even better !! ...my 12 year old boy ,my huby ,and I simply enjoy it @ sea scape ......Gracias . very good for the price. we rented the 1 room cottage.it was clean and we had daily maid service. ive staid in other cheap hotels before, but this one was the best. if u want a fancey place this might not be the place for u. we will be going back. We decided to stay here on a last minute decision. We checked in and got the key and found out that parking was horrible. If you got alot of luggage you better hope you can walk a ways. Second, this motel felt like I was in the ghettos or projects. It was unreal. I had my 3 year old granddaughter with us and was petrified to stay there with her. We got to our room and oh my god the smell when you opened the door was enough to gag you. I checked out the bathroom and the tub was full of rust stains and the ceiling tiles were covered in black mold and mildew. The refrigerator door did not shut and the little freezer had a inch thick ice on it. So that did not work. This was totally unacceptable!!!!! I went to the front office and complained and decided I just wanted my money back and would leave even if that meant we drove back home. They wanted to offer me something at a later date as a credit and I said no way I will not be coming back. The management tried to explain and blame the whole situation on the cleaning team (oh and let me tell you...they were young girls in hoochie shorts and tank tops). I told them that it wasn't the cleaning crew's fault. The manager also said they have someone come in and spray for the mold and mildew. I said, ""then why didn't you spend the extra money to replace the ceiling tile?"" He said and I quote ""it's not the tile, it's what above the tiles."" Needless to say that was enough for me. I can't even imagine whats above the tiles or in the walls!! DO NOT GO THERE!!! ITS DANGEROUS TO YOU AND YOUR HEALTH!!!! I have been staying here for 11 years and have never had a problem. The maid service is perfect. They even make teddy bears out of towels for the kids. I would rather spend my money on fun then an expensive room. what more do you need then a shower, queen size beds, refrigerator, kitchen table, maid servie, cable tv a pool and an office that is very friendly. I have never had a problem with cleanliness in 11 years Stayed here for 2 nights, The shower leaked and was dirty and I would not go to the bathroom there! This place was a dump! No blankets, Moldy smell, Rude employees, NEVER again! I""ve been staying at this motel since 2003, theyve always made me happy!!!!! The rooms are always wat u need or want, and very reasonable, i see no point in paying $300 a nite for 2 beds a bathroom, and a balcony just cuz its name brand!!!!! Had a breezeway room last visit have pool side in 2011! Remember You came for the beach, boards, and fun, so why blow ur fun mony on the courtyard!!!!! Will always be a patron of this wonderful oldschool motel We have been staying at the sea scape for many years now and have never had a problem , the rooms , the staff and owners are all wonderful people , keeping the rates as low as they can to help people like myself able to stil enjoy the ocean. (on the ocean ) To those of you who have a problem you are just a want to be rich person .. If you think your all that go stay at the Hilton we don't want you there anyway I bet your own house looks like some shack. So take your high faluting *** somewhere else!!!!!!! LOVE YOU SEA SCAPE!!!!!!!!!! Donna Richards I have stayed there one time and I will definitely be returning back in August of 2011. The rooms are tidy, and the staff are wonderful. You can't expect to have rooms like at the Hilton for as cheap as these prices are. You won't have extravagant rooms unless you pay hundreds a night somewhere else. Who comes to Ocean City to sit in the rooms all day anyhow, it's basically a place to get cleaned up and sleep. This is the best place to stay, it's directly near the ocean & boardwalk. Come on now, if this place was that bad my teenage daughters would be the first to complain, but they absolutely loved it and everyone should. Just because the hotel may mess up a few times doesn't mean anything. You should try balancing bills, finances, reservations, check-in & check-out's, staff, and etc. I bet you wouldn't be perfect either. But as I say everyone should love this hotel , at least give it a shot ! I just recently came back from Ocean City MD and was very eexcited to go until I got to the hotel! The whole hotel needs a bath and the rooms was stuffy and smelled like they had a bad rain stoem in the room we were staying in! To sum it all up this hotel reminds you of The hooker on the point the HBO specail that's all I could think about! I dislike the place so much that I cut my vacation short and came home 2 days early! The Sea Scape was wonderful. Very Very clean rooms. The pool is very nice. The location is great. You are on the Boardwalk but far enough away from all the crazies on down the board walk. Already looked at booking a room there for next year. Will stay there everyyear. Please Ocean City don't ever tear this place down and build something that your modern everyday family can not afford. Thanks Stacey Me and my boyfriend stayed there last summer and had the best time ever. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We got to know one of the owners pretty well. The room i thought was nice. We plan to keep going there year after year. What can i say it is right near everything!!!!!!!!! We also enjoy going to Pepper Jacks and getting drinks, and being right there at our motel!!",,,
Ali D,2153087,"First of all this hotel is in an excellent location in Sultanahmet area, close to all the main attractions yet tucked away in a quite alley that provides it with a relaxing and quite atmosphere. However, you will probably find many other hotels with similar location advantages in Sultanahmet. The difference for me was the atmosphere inside the hotel itself. As some reviewers have mentioned, you get the feeling you are very welcome and at home. We stayed in a double room which just had a bed with no other furniture, but the bed was very comfortable and the decor was very nice. The owner and staff are friendly and always helpful. They always gave us tips where to go or what to eat, and even lent us utensils to cut the fruit we had bought. The bathroom was tiny and the fan a bit loud, but we didn't mind. We have only two negatives to say about the place. 1) Rooms are not sound proof at all. You can hear footsteps outside and when someone is walking up/down the stairs, if you stay in the first level you can even hear the chatter from the reception which can be a bit annoying. 2) They had some maintance work done in the hotel during our stay, we didn't' hear any noise but one day I stepped out and a tool fell from the construction staff just outside the entrance. It wasn't a close to hitting me but it could well have did. Overall, I highly recommend Modern Sultan hotel! We even returned here for the last leg of our trip in Turkey to spend few more days because we had such a nice time. Pro: It was one of the few available within my price range so I got it. The rooms were nice and staff were generally very nice and polite. You also get fantastic views of Istanbul from the breakfast terrace, with an extensive selection of breakfast food, which we haven't found in any other place. Con: There was a very annoying sound you can hear from the room (level 3), not sure if it was the train station outside or from the elevator but we kept hearing it throughout our stay. Another thing was one of the reception staff, an older guy who looks to be chewing up every time u talk to him, was very annoying. He would always try to sell you things to get commission, found him quite rude at times.","I went out on a group trip started in this hotel and finished in it. I like the hotel, the rooms are fair and the staff are very nice. They really need to invest in some proper curtains, I did tell the manager that! The location in the city is very good and in walking distance to all the main sites. The rooms are nice, but the bathrooms are on the small side, first time I stayed there, the bathroom was a decent size. The second time was in a different room and the bathroom got smaller! But everything is there that you should need, getting a good nights sleep might depend on the room location. There is the side of the hotel next to the train station, but that is generally not that noisey. The lift is loud, but they will have to change that when Turkey update their rules on what most of Europe deem an illegal life! The resturant is on the top floor and has very nice views. The breakfast is decent but could have a little more selection but it should suit almost everyone. So you should have a decent stay.

He would always try to sell you things to get commission, found him quite rude at times. We selected this hotel because of its location. It's located downtown, near tram station (Gulhane if I'm not mistaken). 10-15 minutes walk to major attractions like Ayia Sofia and Sultan Ahmed mosque...hotel staff is quite welcoming and friendly. it;s located close to police stations. you can find many souvenir shop around the hotel area... This hotel is in the very heart of Istanbul close to all major attractions. It is a simple hotel but friendly staff and clean. It has good breakfasts. It is a little hard to find but if you take the tram/ light rail to Serkeci there is a tourist office directly opposite the station who can direct you. good value for money. Me and my family stayed 2 nights at this lovely hotel in Istanbul. First of all, it is pretty tricky to get to the hotel if you don't have a good GPS or good driving directions (if you come by car) as most of the streets are pretty small and one-way. Having problems with getting to the hotel we called the reception and they immediately sent someone to show us the way. The hotel is very clean. Rooms are not large, but very chic and clean. Bathroom is also a bit small, but extremely tasteful and clean. Internet access is very good and free of charge. Another very good thing about the hotel is the fact that it has parking spaces. Breakfast wasn't very varied but ok. The greatest plus of the hotel is it's location. It is very close to Topkapi Palace and Sultanahmet, Gulhanyie Park, the train station is exactly across from the hotel. Shops, restaurants, tram station are very close and very accessible. All and all, it is a very nice hotel with extremely helpful staff. Very close to the main sights to see in the European part of Istanbul and also to many nice restaurants and shops.",,,
gould321,237569,"we were moved here due to the damrack inn being burnt down. this was the worst hotel in the world. bugs, stong smell of pee and for a room of 7 they set 6 beds up and left a mattress on the floor for the 7th bed, room was that small you had to stand all over the bed on the floor to get to the other beds! for a few(not alot) more euros please stay at the westcord city center. Staff had little clue what was happening from the minute we got there. We arrived around 10am ish and they told us that we couldn't get into our room till past 1pm. So we had to leave all our bags on the hotels breakfast kitchen floor or wait with them till 1pm to put them in our rooms. The rooms are a joke. We came down for breakfast pretty early and was told that we was late and that food had already been put away.. We got rooms that over looked the hotels inside that was just filled with about 4 tons of rubish. If people are saying that ""you get what you pay for"" for a quickstop hotel like this then the hotel should be free! Would only recommend this hotel if you needed to catch some sleep for 4-5 hours then straight back out. Thats all we ended up using it for. After a long day/night in Amsterdam it is also quite a walk from the ""heart"" of the city. Good luck belga, you need it! we went as a group of 6, They couldnt give us the 6 man room we booked for some reason so we ended up on the very top floor in a 9 man room. they did knock 20 euros off the bill and scraped the city tax bill tho. room was nine beds and a sink. stairs are a killer but every hotel in amsterdam is the same i guess with the stairs. We literally stayed there for 4 hours sleep. no frills and ok for 20-30 euros pp s*&t hole though Really easy to find. Just a few minutes walk down from the station. As you walk in the lobby and reception looks 1st class. lots of nice seats, friendly staff and large tvs to watch. I'm 6ft3 and getting up the stairs to the rooms was quite fun. Very, very tight and winding. (But this is Amsterdam, where most places and about 15ft wide!) I was with 4 friends and we was all put in the same room. Literally just 4 single beds and a wardrobe. Views were nice, rooms were clean. There was a shared shower at the end of the corridor that i guess was ok. but there must have been a good 6-7 rooms on that level so 1st come 1st served for the shower and loo. 24 hour reception was great, 4 nice nights sleep. Me and my FiancÃÂ© stayed here for one night in June. Having been Amsterdam a few times before and knowing the area I'd say this hotel is placed in the best part for everything! Just outside is the the trams to everywhere and anywhere. You can nearly see the train station to your left and dam square to your right! The hotel lobby and reception are really nice and modernly classy. Our room (411) was spotless and felt massive compared to the""normal"" sized rooms in Amsterdam hotels. Hotel provides tickets for every attraction in Amsterdam with cheaper rates for some attractions too. Breakfasts are an extra 15 euros per person. I thought this was pretty expensive so decided to go the shop next door that has great fresh fruit outside, but one drink of orange and some grapes came to 10 euros so i now wish i would have just gone with the hotels breakfasts. The satalite tv is quite good. internet also. The only slight problem i would say that was wrong with the hotel is that the old windows let a lot of noise in from the tram stops outside the hotel. Our timing was pretty bad as they were half way thru construction of the tram lines so outside the hotel was kind of a building site. Not the hotels fault but the noise from the trams was very noticeable all night. All in all i loved my stay at the westcord and having been in other hotels in Amsterdam i think next time i return it will be to westcord from now on.","- breakfast was a ""sort of"" - shower needs maintenance/to be repared - room ok for the price - But a real nice staff ... and I loved the cat My first trip to Amsterdam so unable to compare with other hotels. However I have been in a number of cities and found Amsterdam generally expensive. So with this in mind was 150 Euro a night for a three person room a few hundred yards from Dam Sq over the Easter weekend good value? I felt the room was poor, even dingy but it is in an old building full of character. Beds were clean and comfortable but towels were never changed or beds made during the 4 nights there. We asked for clean towels on day 3 and they were given. Some new decor and this place could be a winner as its location is near the Anne Frank museum and in a safe area with easy walking to so much of Amsterdam. The self service breakfast was excellent and the house cat was so friendly. One other comment on the church bells that ring through the night every half hour ! Lovely in daytime though. No sure of its star rating but more of a bed and breakfast. we booked this hotel due to budget, our hopes werent that high but we didnt expect it to be quite as bad.The bed sheets were clean but the rooms and hall ways were not. Also breakfast was only toast. However for the amount of time that we spent in the rooms it did the job, I would recommend this hotel if you are only goin to Amsterdam for a couple of days and plan to spend very little time in your room. Do not book this hotel if you will be having early nights and want breakfast included. Despite all of this the hotel staff were lovely. Stayed for a night in a single room. Location is excellent, great value for money. It is a bit run down, in the sense of some stains in the carpet, stuff like that. However, I am not too demanding, for the price it was great value for money. Friendly service, modest breakfast included. I would certainly recommend the hotel and would stay again. We are just back from staying at this Hotel, after reading reveiews , We were dreading going , But were surprised to find Cheerfull helpfull staff... Its by no means the Ritz , but for what we paid for it and its location , couldnt ask for more... we were in the dreaded room 9, and yeah the floors are slanted, and its a bit run down, but beds were clean and you get extra bedding, we even got a sweet left on the pillows on arrival, and best of all you get an ashtray in your room and in the Dam this is a must...Cleaners were there everyday if you wanted anything, towels etc, Breakfast was scarambled eggs , toast, mini sausages, ham and cheese, perfect. Wet room shower worked great always hot water and heating was never off... So cant see why people are moaning to be honest, you get what you pay for , and for seeing Amsterdam, and being close to everything then we would recomend this Hotel and would stay there again for sure, so if your not expecting the Ritz then dont go . but if you want a good base no hassle, and breakfast then its for you .. Happy holidays ... Do not stay here! My boyfriend booked this (unfortunately!) for us to stay in Amsterdam and it was terrible! We were led to believe that we had a double room which actually turned out to be a single. The card swipe door mechanism didn't work and one of the girls from reception came with a screwdriver and packet of batteries and was able to open the door that way. No en suite, we had to use the disgusting shared bathroom, most mornings I just got washed in the sink in the bedroom as it was horrible. We had a first floor room with single glazed windows windows didn't feel very secure and looked out onto bins. The floor of the room was uneven with one side of the room on an incline, as I have very bad reflux we had to lie with our heads at the foot of the bed. The bed linen was clean but the carpets not so much. I have stayed in quite a few hostels before which have been much nicer than this 'hotel'. Would not recommend! Or I should say stay in this hotel if you don't mind having a visit every night from mice and some type of insect that bites you in bed. Or if you don't mind seeing dirty laundry bags in the hallways everyday. Bad lighting in rooms etc. etc. I could go on and on... The place needs an overall good remodeling and cleaning up. I chose this hotel for my second stay in Amsterdam and was surprisingly impressed. I had a three person room which ended up costing about 75 euro per night or 25 per person. The room was clean however the three single beds were pushed together creating an island bed. The bathroom was a bit small, but compared with the hostels in the city a much better value. Each morning there was a free breakfast which included eggs, some deli meats, cereal, juice, and tea/coffee. The staff was helpful and the location just a minute away from Dam Square was great. In group with other three friends, we had the first problem with the room magnetic key, that didn't work leaving us outside all night long (our luggage was inside). The staff didn't manage to open it nor to call his boss to fix it. Our first night in Amsterdam has been horrible; we slept in another room, dirty and with only three beds (we were four). The boss didn't make us discounts for this event, and the whole bill was already paid at our arrive. We went to hotel belga between 27-04-2010 and 2-05-2010 and had a create time, the rooms are dated but very clean and there is a nice breakfast buffet in the morning. The staff is helpful and the help you with everything if you want to go somewhere. The location is perfect in the center and everything on walking distains. And the queens day was nice the hall city was orange. We go back for sure. My Flight got canceled because of the Volcanic ash and they charged my credit card for all 3 days They would not give me my money back and when I contacted them I got this response. Dear Madame, Sir, We are sorry but we are not responsible for the nature disasters. We advice to contact you travel insurance for this matter. Staff had little clue what was happening from the minute we got there. We arrived around 10am ish and they told us that we couldn't get into our room till past 1pm. So we had to leave all our bags on the hotels breakfast kitchen floor or wait with them till 1pm to put them in our rooms. The rooms are a joke.

JulieBWatfordUK,653684,"We were quitting a disappointing expensive hotel (Chiara) and this seemed ideal: central, cheap, spotless. Alessandro is rather 'effusive', and I wish i hadn't invited him to my room to check the TV, but he was easily pushed away. My female cousin and I had a single room each, and were very comfortable. We were fairly convinced Alessandro has Asberger's, rather than being really menacing, but if you're worried and not feisty, be warned. Breakfast was simple but ok, bread and jam, but for the price and position, it was fine. I'd use it again - but with my husband! Restaurant downstairs was good but expensive, and the waiter there took a persistent shine to my cousin! And we are 2 ladies in our fifties!! What a visit! We booked the top floor room at 350 euros a night, but really felt that, apart from the view, the price was unjustified. The receptionist did not smile once. The porter was delightful, as was the lad who replenished breakfast items, and the chambermaid, but they seemed to be the only ones with a desire to give good service; certainly not the reception staff. The area and location are very good which is one reason we chose it. On the plus side, the decor was good, and it was quiet. The view was magnificent. On the minus side, well, here's our list: *powerpoints fell out of the wall as we pulled plugs out *missing button on tap *chips and scratches in bath *low water pressure *discoloured and rusting bathroom fitments *chimney smoke on our 'luxury' terrace *needs decent fan in internal bathroom * Insect screen needed against mosquitoes *breakfast crockery not well washed This was my Australian cousin's holiday of a lifetime, and we were very disappointed. I have been to Venice several times, and have always had a more positive experience. I am sad to write such a negative review. As you can see, and as others have written, most problems are with the bathroom.","I read some of the comments left by other women and I am a bit surprised, so I decided to write a review as well. :) I am sorry if anyone had a bad experience, however I stayed in al Gobbo last year in May, when I was on a road-trip in Italy and everything was fine. Stopping in Venice was a last minute decision (I was on a motorbike and on my own) heading for Treviso. I speak Italian, so perhaps it makes things easier. I asked for an inexpensive, but a clean and a safe place and Al Gobbo had it all. It was recommended to me by a receptionist in a hotel that was more expensive. Depending on one's cultural background, Alessandro (the receptionist in al Gobbo) may seem a bit too friendly, which is pretty common for Italians, but my impression was that he was harmless. I concur he may suffer from Asperger's and it was noticeable right at the check-in. I also accepted his invitation for an aperitivo and dinner in the neighboring restaurant, because I wanted to return the favor for a good accommodation price. Everything was OK, he was friendly and polite and just curious about where I was from and why I was travelling on a motorbike alone. I didn't feel uncomfortable and I don't think that I look scary or aggressive. :)) So to sum it up, I'd recommend this place to couples on budget or solo travelers who are looking for a last minute place to stay in and who want to be close to the train station, Piazzale Roma or 15-min away from Rialto.

What a visit! despite the weird manager it is very well located, the beds are just ok to sleep after a whole day walking... I wish i had seen this reviews before, I stayed here because my trip to venice wasn't planed out well and by the time i got there everything was, either booked or too expensive. I found this hotel... got the room and left to see the city, by the time i got back to the hotel, the weird manager was trying HARD to get me to stay with him, he tried the kissing and touching thing. Sadly for me it was too late and couldn't leave, so I had to stay there (by the way, I was the only guest in the hote in a city that was fulll) and end up paying for a place where I couldn't sleep thinking the worst, and couldn't enjoy properly the beautifull Venice. It is not worth going through that for a good location. I do NOT recommend it",,,
cpaonessa,310251,"This will be a short and sweet review. Stayed here in November 2009 for my 25th birthday! -- Picked Caesars Palace because it looked great, and we got a killer deal! The hotel is GORGEOUS! The rooms are fantastic. Modern, Clean and Full of amentities. The location is fantastic and the staff are more than helpful. The food in the hotel (as well as on the strip) are MORE than up to par and the nightlife - in and out of the hotel - are FUN!!! I recommend this hotel to EVERYONE - as it suits the needs of any type of traveller. Note: The amentities in the room (ie: digital camera, and other things available you can purchase) are SENSORED! Each time you move them from the spot they originated from, the item is then charged to your room. Once put back on the spot - it's credited back. As long as everything is still in the room when you leave - you're not charged - but we had ONE HECK of a field day looking at our BILL during checkout. Just an fyi.... Upon my arrival in Amsterdam, my friends and I were stuck without a hotel for our first night. We sat in a cafe with free wi-fi internet searching and searching for somewhere to accomodate 5 people within' our price range for the one evening. By fluke, we stumbled upon Le Coin - Residence which miraculously had a 5 person room available for a decent price. The place itself is generally not advertised as a hotel, as we found out that it normally acts as student housing throughout the year. We were SO happy to have somewhere to stay after hours of lugging around our luggage, that this place seemed like a godsend! Pro's - Good location --- within' walking distance to the main square, shopping, restaurants, etc - Reasonable price - Large room size --- For 5 of us, we ended up having the whole top floor, which consisted of 2 bed rooms (1 room 2 beds, 1 room 3 single beds) and each room had a small kitchenette, a desk, a small tv, and a sofa and chairs. The two rooms were separate quarters .. with a shared bathroom in between. MORE than sufficient for our needs. Sure, the rooms arent decorated, and have no amentities you'd find in a real hotel, but you have the necessities. Cons - A little outdated. - Rooms were freezing at night (because we werent aware we had to turn the HEAT ON when entering) - The elevator doesn't make it to the top floor, so you have to go up 2 flights of narrow stairs (with LUGGAGE!!!) to get to it. - Only one person working at the time we were there, so we had to go down ourselves if we needed anything. For the price, and the rut we were in, we couldn't have asked for more. I prefer a hotel style accomodation generally, but if you're not picky, and you want a good location + a good price and are OK with it being completely basic.. .then I would definately recommend this place. There are SO many hotels in Amsterdam. Some good, some bad...I'd put this one somewhere in between. This will be a short and sweet review.

Dimitri and Jesse always gave us incredible and amazing restaurant recommendations that normally only the locals know of!!!! We also had a room, requested, that overlooked the canal....yes, it was active, but we kind of liked that! There are other rooms available, if you prefer the quiet... Our room was huge, extremely clean and had a kitchenette! Perfect to celebrate my daughter's attaining her Masters and a Job!!! I stayed here for a conference, and the location is fantastic - right by a canal, close to shops, the university, the flower market and more. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the central station. I liked the room, which had a small tea kitchen (that we didn't use) and a sofa and coffee table as well as a desk. I thought the bed was extremely hard and the pillows very soft, and I didn't sleep too well the first night. The second night, a Friday, I slept fine but everyone else at the conference complained about the street noise, apparently there was a disco that the hotel claimed was a one-off event, but others said the noise came from the bar on the corner. So I have mixed feelings about this hotel, really. Upon my arrival in Amsterdam, my friends and I were stuck without a hotel for our first night.

It has internet connection but you have to pay to use it, it has a coffee maker but no coffee, breakfast is expensive so it's best to go out and find something. There is no air conditioning which I could cope with but it would have been easier had there been a summer duvet rather than a thick autumn/winter one. The biggest drawback for me was the single bed, it was so uncomfortable, especially because it was so narrow - this alone would cause me to try another hotel next time. This is a shame as it's clean, well located and friendly. Two of us went to the Netherlands for two nights but ended up staying a week, due to a certain Icelandic volcano. We were at the airport when the flights were cancelled. Travelled into Amsterdam to find somewhere to stay, along with many hundred others. We were very lucky to come across Le Coin. The staff were brilliant. With a hotel full of stressed and stranded travellers, they worked so hard looking up travel plans for everyone, and taking care of us all. Use of the washing machine was much appreciated! It's a great location for visiting the city. Next to the canals, flower market, and a short walk from the centre, but away from the bustle you'll find there.",,,
LubbockTexas,98037,very nice clean rooms nice pool comfy beds enjoyed my stay. Great hotel clean rooms nice bathroom comfy beds.The bar was great had good food the fitness center was clean free parking airport shuttle clean swimming pool.I would stay here again. were should I begin?the sink was really small.there were hairs all over the bathroom.The bathroom was tiny .the room service wasn't avalible when I needed it.,"I have never written a bad review until now! This is also the first time I check out of a hotel and call the health department. I moved from the Clarion next door because there rates went up and check into this dump! The desk person was a woman that spoke little English, even through the parking lot was dark only one side of the building lit up I thought what the heck it only $29. First they said they had no rooms for $29 (even through the sign said $29) so I paid $39. I went to my room it was ok till I turned on the lightsâ¦well the 2 lights that worked. Bed had hair in it there were burn marks all over the carpet the bathroom light would not stay on the toilet did not flush and had a present in it from the last guest. The hall to get to the room was covered in mold and the lobby was about 20 degrees. Went to the desk to ask for another room and on the way there was told by an older blond I could have a good time for $25 at this point the room and her combined would not have been worth $25( noticed 3 other working girls). Asked the desk person for a new room was told they did not have one (keep in mind there were only 4 cars in the dark lot). So I asked for my money back and was told simply ânoâ. So I went back to the Clarion next door! I paid $69 and was happy to do so! Lesson learned, if the parking lot is empty and dark and the desk person does not speak English pay more! Great hotel clean rooms nice bathroom comfy beds.The bar was great had good food the fitness center was clean free parking airport shuttle clean swimming pool.I would stay here again. This was by far the worse place I have ever stayed. I am female and I was there to visit a friend. I found out that the owners of this hotel also own a trucking company (Nationwide Carriers) and they run the trucking company out of the hotel. I saw a ton of 18-wheelers around back. That is why their parking lot is full of potholes. When I was there, I was walking out the front door and two nasty, dirty truck drivers approached me and said that they have a community room (I think it is room 146 if my memory serves me correctly) and I look like I like to have fun and asked me to come to their rooms. I was scared, and I lied and said I was waiting on my husband to come to the lobby. The truck drivers said they stay in the hotel for free because it is their home office for their company and they love to have fun. This hotel is also lurking with prostitutes, who know about the trucker room. You can see these women walking around the halls and the management is aware, but they don't care. They allow these women to come into their establishment to ""please their drivers"". I am a family oriented person, and I did realize such things existed. All the other negative comments about the rooms are correct, from holes in the ceiling to one of the hallway walls completely exposed to the outside world. It is not safe, and after one night I was out of there. I am writing this review to warn people about the dangers they are in with these horny, nasty truck driver's they have lurking around the place. One truck driver said to me they are bored cause they don't have a car and their boss won't let them drive the big truck, so all they do is walk the halls looking for a ""good time."" Everyone - beware! Oh yeah, and the black lady at the counter is VERY RUDE, and the Indian guy that was there the next morning was acting and talking like he was a rapper, and he was rude. Just a really weird experience for me. I won't be going back!",,,
Bridget B,580059,"Let me be clear. This is not a 5-star hotel, but I will gladly give it a 5-star rating for what it is. We had a fantastic stay and highly recommend the place. A great value a block from the boardwalk. The room was clean, very large (with a table and chairs and sleeper sofa). The bathroom was clean. Others complain about a mildew smell. Yes, this is apparent. As it is in every beach hotel I have stayed at. This is another reason why there is no carpet (but there was a nice area rug, which I wasn't expecting). Fridge and microwave were clean. Pillows were soft, but flat, as other reviews have said. So, bring some pillows. But the bed was very comfy. It was quiet. It was great. We will love going back. THE ATMOSPHERE, PEOPLE, SERVICE AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE FANTASTIC Where to start? The good-beautiful blue waters, sand and swimming, the spa gym and pools. The fabulous- the town of Playa del Carmen. Minutes away by cab and very hip,offering lots of fun places to eat and dance the night away. I travelled with my son and his finance we had a blast in the evening at the disco. . Each inconsistency was met with the standard reply of passing the buck and no one actually owning it. That make me see red and negates their five star rating.It happened even at the end where we were promised something as simple as a shuttle to the ferry since we were flying out of Cozumel and the Sandos valet shrugging his shoulders as if they have nothing to do with the time share staff who made the promise. No one to call, nothing to do but pay for our own cab. I loved the Mexican staff and how friendly they were.Sandos is huge and divided up into areas where it seemed like an all inclusive caste system of wrist bands. . The room design ( in the adult only area) was fresh and lovely . The spa is fantastic, great gym and hydrotherapy waters. i would go back in a heartbeat.lovely place, excellent service, mind blown beach. Food was superb","Let me be clear.

August 3rd and 4th 2012 We checked in at 3:00 pm exactly, the bathroom has mold growing on it and does not look like the shower stall was ever scrubbed. The beds were weak and the pillows were flat. AC barely worked thank god we do not spend time in the room. Great location. No internet service available. Last day we got up. Commode was backed up. not sure why went to the front desk and they said, it would be two hours before someone could come over. OK . Had to use the bathroom in the office. Left one hour later. Had a great time, the people from Altoona PA.. (Steelers fans) were the best guest ever next door. The place was nice and very well located to everything. Place was really nice and clean...Would and going to book for next year... also. If I thought I could have found anywhere else to stay on short notice, since we decided on a whim to pack up and stay the night at ocean city for 1 night only I would have done so immediately after opening the door to the room. Tiles missing in bathroom, microwave was disgusting, bath mat was a piece of paper, other things broken missing like wallpaper, holes in walls, etc. We were told this was due to end of season since we were there end of September, but this much horribleness does not happen in just a few months. This is a run down piece of crap that will never again get any of my money. Next time if I can not find anywhere else I will just go home. When I saw this room I thought I was thinking the health dept should shut this place down. It is a non refundable place. It was so nasty that I checked the bed for bed bugs. Also, the paneling was coming off the wall and the microwave looked like it has never been cleaned. The toilet took 15 mins to fill up before you could flush again. It was a shi*hole for sure..NOT WORTH 250.00 for a weekend!!! We got there and no one was in the office (standing outside smoking while we waited) When we got the keys our friends and I lugged our stuff up to the room (2nd floor) to find that the room was a sh*thole! It reeked of mold, the baseboard heater was in a couple of pieces on the floor, the panelling on the wall was falling down, the microwave was covered in rust, etc. We took our stuff back to the car and went back to demand a refund. Then the guy has the nerve to tell us "" i normally get twice what i charged you"" and "" no one has vacancy in town so i'll hold the room for half an hour"" also "" we are close to the ocean so thats why the microwave is rusty"" Never ever ever consider this place!!! This was the most disgusting room I have ever stayed in. The other reviews are completely right. I don't have a problem with how small the room is but I had a major problem with how the rooms are maintained. When you first walk in your towels, soap, and bath ""mat"" are sitting on your bed. The microwave and mini-fridge are worn down, rusted, and look like they came from a thrift store. There is no phone or alarm clock in the room. The bathroom was modest and didn't look that bad but the water temperature in the shower and sink would constantly change from hot to cold and back again. (I def wore sandals in the shower tho) One of the towels smelled like someone's booty (yuk!). When I went to lay down I pulled back the sheet and there was a blood stain on it. When the guy at the front desk came up to change the sheets one of the ones he was going to put on had a ""mystery"" stain on it. He ended up putting two flat sheets on the bed. After that my friend and I cut one night off our 3 night stay and couldnt find vacancy at any other places in the mean time. I will never stay there again.",,,
AarniH,1905091,"This hostel is located right next to the metro Urgell (Gran via/Compte d`urgell exit), and few minutes away to Aerobus stop from the airport, and bit further away the stop to the airport. There is plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, you can reach the old town, and all the other places quickly by metro or by walking. There is a cafe just between the hostel and metro station, Supermarket is located on the same street about 100meters away. My room was located on the second floor, Big enough for one, there was tv with dvd player, little safe and a french balcony on the room. The same apparment had 4 other rooms, two bathrooms, two toilets, kitchen and a living room. One computer was available plus free wifi if you have your laptop with you. Cheap, 250pesos for single, and 290pesos for double on room with window, rooms with no windows are cheaper. Rooms and public spaces were clean and in good condition. Offers free wifi, but does only work in lobby. There is also one computer with internet available on the lobby, 10pesos/20mins. Rooms with window/french balcony can be noisy during the day, but during week nights noise level is ok for sleeping. During the weekend there is an night club near, and you can hear clearly what song they are playing, even when balcony door is closed. Staff are friendly, but they do not speak english very well Location is great, few minutes to the Zocalo, museums, nightlife and shops.","We booked an economy double room for two nights at less than thirty euro a night. Not right in the tourist area, but a 10 minute walk away or you can use the metro which is 20m away from the front door. Absolutely spotless rooms, very bright and modern. We worried the economy double would be too small but it was very roomy. If you don't mind some street noise, try and ask for a room looking over the street. They had already charged our credit card for two nights when we arrived, so make sure you show up or give ample notice of cancellations because they do things by the book. Only negative would be the water-saving spring taps in the bathroom were extremely annoying, but the bathrooms themselves were spotless. A quiet, clean stay and excellent value. We stayed here in September and would definitely recommend it to our friends. The room was very cute and the whole place had lots of character. Our room had a balcony overlooking a central courtyard - a great place to sit and enjoy a glass of wine after many hours on foot! The bathroom was always clean and we were pleasantly suprised to discover a well-outfitted kitchen. The area was very quiet (in comparison to other places we stayed in various cities). The hotel itself was alway very quiet. The Barri Gotic and La Rambla are about a 15 minute walk away, and there is a Metro Station (Urgell) about 100 meters from the front door. The only down side to this place is that there is only staff manning the office until 9pm - so don't lose/misplace your key to the front door (or try to check-in late)! Otherwise, it's a fantastic place and great value! We stayed there on October 2010. We baraly ran into somebody in those days so it was quiet and nice. The room was clean and had all what we needed. It also had a high ceiling so we never felt hot there. I am particularly picky with bathrooms but they had two of them for one floor and they kept them very clean. Only downs was that they had the speakers outside of our room and they would sometimes leave them playing music all day but at night we would turn them off. We got a room with view to the inside patio, probably if you get one with view to the main street it will be a bit noisy.

Emma S,1758720,"Had a fabulous trip to Mr. C. The staff were wonderful, very helpful at all times. Check in with a Bellini, house car to use within a 3 mile radius and late check out, they did everything to help us!! Loved the glass pool table, very unique! Great views of the hills and the 'Hollywood sign' from our balcony. The rooms were gorgeous. This is very good value for money staying in a lovely part of town. Choy (spelling?) was extremely helpful. We will be recommending this hotel and will be back for sure! The restaurant is very good also! When they did not have what I wanted it was no problem, they made it for me. Go to Mr. C., it's a hidden Gem!! Xxx We've just got back from a 3 night stay at Ca' Formenta and we loved it. The location is perfect - 10-15mins walk from the main tourist areas so far enough away that you can get away from the crowds. Plenty of restaurants etc around the hotel and the view is amazing. Definitely pay extra for the lagoon view room, it really makes a difference. Rooms were spotless, if a little on the small side and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Reallly handy for the water bus and the connection to the airport as well. Would definitely stay again. I really can't say enough GREAT things about this resort. If you want a low-key, romantic kind of setting, then this is the place. You are always greeted by the employees with a smile and they all work so hard. The property is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. We never left the property because you had everything available to you. One thing to know is that the resort is very spread out so plan to do a lot of walking and bring comfortable shoes. I'm not a big fan of creepy animals so be prepared to see a lot of iguanas. Our room was cleaned in the morning (you can request an exact time you want it cleaned) and the bed was pulled down for you in the early evening. Bring plenty of one or five dollar bills to tip the workers. If you want to tip the woman that cleans your room you need to leave her a note stating that the money is for her. Otherwise she won't take it. The restaurants are all good and the breakfast buffet is the best. Make sure to read your guide in the room to see which restaurants have certain attire you need to wear. Our building was a little far from the restaurants so we had room service a couple times. Good food! The main pool area is loud with music and entertainment with the staff dancing, etc.. If you don't want all that noise, then go to the lazy pool near building six. It is nice and quiet. The shows in the evenings were good. Make sure you see the Michael Jackson show! It was very entertaining. I would definitely return to this resort if it wasn't so expensive. You really do get what you pay for. This resort is a winner! We stayed at the hotel for 5 days, when we first arrived the man at the front desk was very rude. We had been looking forward to this trip for months and had researched the hotel prior to our stay. When my fiancÃ© asked the man about the free breakfast buffet we had read about online he informed us that if we wanted the buffet we would have to pay $13.00 a day per person to get it. So the next morning we ended up skipping breakfast. My fiancÃ© asked a different front desk attendant about the breakfast buffet they let him know that it was free and didn't understand why the other man had told us we would be charged. The location is ok, it costs about $8 for a taxi downtown. We were switched rooms, and neither of our rooms had a refrigerator which was hard since we were staying there for a full week and couldn't keep any leftovers. Overall, I'm surprised this hotel is a Marriott. All other Marriott's I have been to have been a lot nicer! Its an ok place to stay, and the view of the lake is nice if you are on one of the higher floors. We stayed for 7 days and had a great time! The rooms were a bit loud...the heater and neighboors...oh well! Perfect location to EVERYTHING and lots of parking. Had a fabulous trip to Mr. C. The staff were wonderful, very helpful at all times.

Its an ok place to stay, and the view of the lake is nice if you are on one of the higher floors. The Park Inn is in a fantastic location - the Alexanderplatz train station is right on the doorstep, the iconic TV tower is just the other side and there are plenty of sights within walking distance. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable. We were given a room with beds pushed together, but when we asked for a normal double bed we were given one without hesitation or fuss. Nice staff. Only two things that were not quite what we expected: - There was no wifi in the rooms (although there is cable connection at a cost) - The toilet and shower are in opaque glass cubicles. We didn't mind at all, but we could see that some people wouldn't like it. I had booked in to stay here for 3 nights from 12th Feb and ended up staying for a week. Playa Del Carmen is very busy & commerical, so if you stay in the centre, you can expect to be within 2 minutes walk of noise noise noise. This place is a bit away from the centre, so is much more peaceful if you'd like some sleep :). It takes about 20 mins to walk into the town, or you can get a cab to any of the beaches for $2/3 at the end of the road. My fiance & I have been backpacking for a year, have spent 2 months in Mexico & we found this to be the best value place we've stayed anywhere. About the same as a double bed with shared bathroom in a hostel in the centre and here we had a whole apartment to ourselves with the luxury of cooking. The studio apartments are clean and comfortable (great bed), with a free 20l water bottle, cleaning every day, sofa, air con, wifi etc. While I'd disagree with the review below, I do agree it probably depends on what you are looking for and who you're travelling with - if you are expecting a high end hotel or an extensive kitchen in a private apartment, you should probably be willing to pay the big bucks to check into that kind of place - Playa Del Carmen I would imagine that to easily be in the $00s! If you're looking for a quiet, friendly, economical place with the facilities of home, I think this is your best bet. All in all, one of the best value places we've had and for Playa Del Carmen, an absolute steal.","I had booked in to stay here for 3 nights from 12th Feb and ended up staying for a week.

All in all, one of the best value places we've had and for Playa Del Carmen, an absolute steal. This is a little gem in Playa del Carmen. It has free WiFi, a beautiful courtyard, clean spacious rooms and very friendly service for very little money. My 2 adult children and I shared a room with 3 comfortable beds, bath, A/C and kitchenette for only $60 in the height of the tourist season (New Year's Eve). I highly recommend it! We were moving to PDC and wanted to find an inexpensive place to stay that provided breakfast and was pet friendly and we thought this place fit the bill. There are two parts to the hotel----a bed and breakfast and an apartment hotel. Both are very nice. We were allowed to look at both parts before deciding which room we wanted. The apartment side is very nice with a grassy area and the room we looked at included a small separate living area with a couch, a small kitchen and separate bedroom. The room was really delightful and clean. We then looked across the street at the bed & breakfast side, the side with the Robinson Curusoe looking house. This is the side that has a small pool and where breakfast is served. We really liked the look of the cabin we stayed in as it had stone walls which felt authentically Mexico. I don't think you'd go wrong with either side. The Apartment hotel rooms are much bigger, so if you're more than two people, this is a great option. Breakfast was very nice...homemade bread each am, jam and butter, fresh fruit consisting of papaya, watermelon and cantelope, cereal and coffee and tea. There is also a very nice common kitchen guests can use if they want to. We did not use the pool as we were busy trying to find a long term place to live. We did rent the bikes, which was just a bit of a hassle as they require a $50.00 deposit and rent the bikes for 100 pesos per week, which was reasonable. Bike locks were included. The hotel is in the neighborhood where the locals live. We found it convenient for what we were doing, and there are many good restaurants close by. There's also a very nice public park nearby. All in all, I really enjoyed this place. The only ""complaint"" if you will is that no one that worked there spoke English. It wasn't a very big deal though, as if we weren't able to communicate, the employees called the owner Vanessa so we could speak English to her. Everyone worked very hard to keep the place clean constantly. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this place! the place itself is nice. however, the first five days of my stay i had to take cold showers! no hot water was available supposedly due to solar powered water heater.i called the owner and she was not very understanding and not particulary friendly either. and she actually got mad at me for calling to tell her of the problem and said she was going to charge me for the phone call! overall the staff was not friendly and made me feel awkward the entire stay. the location is not good. very far from beach. there is wifi but it goes in and out and sometimes doesnt work at all. I stayed at Casaejido for 2 weeks, along with friends. I am not into the AI resorts, this was perfect for me. The owner and staff were absolutely wonderful. My apartment was very clean and comfortable, equipped with kitchen, diningroom, livingroom, king bed and a complete bathroom with shower. With only 14 suites, everyone got to know everyone and would often gather in the beautiful courtyard in the evening and do potluck or just cocktails together, play music and just have fun. Continental breakfast was always on the table in the courtyard by 7:30 a.m. with coffee, fresh homemade bread everyday, choice of dry cereals and always fruit. The apartments were about a 15 minute walk down the main street to the beach. It was a lovely walk. or you could cab for $2 USD. Large grocery store 3 blocks away. No TV's there, but who needs TV when on vacation. Free wifi, so we had internet. We spent all day at the different beaches or on 5th avenue...but was so nice to come to our home away from home at night. It is located in a quiet residential area away from the bar street. I have travelled alot to different countries and you are really getting value for your money here. Like I said, if you are not looking for AI, you need to check this out. I for one, will absolutely return...LOVED IT!!",,,

No help. Will not reverse charges following their mistake! Should be able to give zero stars. We chose Hotel L'amiral while we had read other's reviews about it. Our main reason to choose was it's location as it is about 30 min walking to the Eiffel which is a relief (however this is not a straightforward & easy rout). The bad thing is that it is a bit hard to find the hotel. We were lucky that Parisian people were really friendly in helping us with finding addresses even with poor english! The hotel is just basic in my opinion. We got a very small room with a backyard view. It was just after the first day that we found out there were empty rooms with Eiffel view that we could move if we want. The elevator was very small. Room was not so clean. Bed coverings were old & worn out. The bathroom was big enough, reasonably clean & there was a bath tub.There was no minibar. WiFi connection was fast in the room. The most annoying thing was the toilet odor since the ventilation system didn't work in the bathroom & we had to leave the window open always. The staff was friendly & helpful. They prepared us what we asked for. They gave us an iron which we desperately needed! Also we asked for some boiled water & they brought us a full tea service with no extra charge! Overall, it was OK for 2-3 nights since hotels in Paris are often expensive with poor quality. reception; the stuf were nice but they were not helpful the manger was rude, the hotel take from my master card the price twice, and i had problem between the bank and the hotel. the room was old fashion and very small not like i saw it in booking.com. the Elevator very small and takes ages to go up. Location : Very good. Very central. Most eateries are round the corner. The Vaugigard metro station is nearby too. Ambience, & hotel stay : We were three of us on a budget trip so took up a double room with an extra bed, and cost wise was very effective ! But sadly, what you see in pictures is what you get. Not an inch more not an inch less. So yes, for 3 people, it was quite cramped. With the beds, a table & 3 suitcases we had to literally jump around to navigate the room. BUt then, we werent complaining that much, since we spent the least amount of sleeping hrs in this room. Ambience was decent overall. Staff : Were a little grumpy. the ones who understood english were not exactly helpful, and the girl who didnt converse very well in english was utterly sweet. So, you know! we found our way around thanks to pamphlets :) The life and the staircase are worth mentioning - The lift was extremely tiny. Would hold one person & one suitcase & thats about it. And trust me, if you suffer from a wee bit of claustrophobia, you will probably decease in there! So yeah we managed again...climbing 4 levels through the spiral staircase. Each day at least 4 times up n down for 4 days! :) Price : Very cost effective for budget travellers! We picked L'Amiral for a cheap weekend break in Paris,we paid 320 euros for 3 nights and compared to other hotels in paris this was very resonable.The hotel is in a lovely area which feels safe even at night.The rooms are well appointed and very clean and the bathroom is a resonable size (i was expecting to not be able to turn around after reading some reviews!) We had a room on the top floor of the hotel and a fab view of the Eiffel tower! The room had double windows which made it feel very Parisian! The bed was really comfy and we didnt hear a nosie from the streets below so slept really well.The staff were really friendly and we got some recomendations for some fantastic resturants and bars so do ask! The only few downsides are the location-it is about a 20 minute walk from the Eiffel tower and then its a further 10-15 mins before you are near any resturants,shopping and even further still to any of the other famous landmarks in Paris.Yes there is a metro station very near by but personally i wouldnt use the metro at night. The only other thing was the cleaning lady was very loud on a morning-you could hear her in the other rooms from very early. Generally the hotel is really great and very friendly and besides the location is everything you need. My partner and I wanted to do a last minute trip to Paris and were looking for hotels online. We were going by car so needed accommodation with car park available. I lined up several options and called the hotels to enquire about car parking. By the gentleman who answered the phone at Amiral hotel, I was told that not only was the car parking included in the rate, the swimming pool was as well. I decided to book the room and showed up the following day to then be told, by the gentleman at reception, that car parking was at an additional cost of 20 euros per day. This gentleman was clearly very stressed as he was trying to leave for the day, the next person was not there yet and he could not help with check in coz he had to close the register plus he kept insisting (almost shouting) that I had to pay for the carparking. He informed us, and other guests, of this in a very rude and agressive manner so we ended up leaving our stuff in the hotel to go sightseeing and wait for someone else to help us. Anyway, I will make a very long story short. I travel weekly for business and am vert familiar with 4 and 5 star hotels. This is not one of them. If you are looking for basic and accessible and you dont need carpark, it will do the job. If you are looking for a slight bit more, including service, space, quiet and cooperation, don't go here.",,,
Peggy_Pegster,206929,"Great location, big room (it was a suite), with a big bathroom! Everything is right at the doorstep....we were staying in a suite with huge balcony overlooking Placa Catalunya! You get the occasional traffic noise from the main roads below..otherwise, we slept really soundly. It's not an ultra modern or boutique hotel but certainly get by...I mean Barcelona is so exciting , tons of sight-seeing, activities - you really won't spend lots of time in the hotel. It's actually not too small, great if you are there alone - it gets a little cram if you share it with someone. The toilet didn't work for the last 2.5 days of the one week stay, couldn't flush, they couldn't fix it , although they offered to change the room - I was really too comfy to change ...4 days staying in the same room with stuff all over the place - the last time you wanna do is to include packing into the itinerary in SPain! Good thing is they aren't too pushy of getting us out of the room , although they try by insisting at first telling us there are major changes need to be done to the room. After that I realized that they have asked several other of my colleagues to moved out of their room as well.....hmmmm.... Their balconies face directly at a residential building opposite - so remember to draw your curtains! Very simple reception, very simple breakfast - there are scramble eggs and sausage links and of course all the cold cuts: breakie european style. Went there, realize my electrical adaptor does not fit into the Spainish wall plugs (not because of the prong type but because of the shape of the plug)....try to get one in the reception and they ran out of them apparently. So I went to several shops asking for an adaptor with my broken spanish...they don't have them in supermarkets, I have to walk 7 minutes to a Chinese run shop that sells everything. The subway station is round about 7 - 10 minutes walk away - if you are going during autumn, remember to bring an umbrella, else you will end up like me totally soaked in a thunderstorm as I find my way back to the hotel in the night.... It's not a fantastic hotel, but certainly can get by - was in this hotel as when I was there, there's a 10, 000 delegate conference occuring at the same time as a festive season in Sept when they celebrate for the end of summer ...so do book early if you are planning to go Barcelona during the peak season! This Park Royal hotel in Darling Harbour, Sydney, just like the other Park Royal hotels in the world, is a fine one keeping in line with its standards as a 4 - 5 stars hotel. It is clean, comfortable located conveniently by Darling Harbour, 8 mins walk from Chinatown, 10 mins walk away from Town Hall Station and 15 - 20 mins walk away from Hyde Park. Although it doesn't boast the best views (located right by the highway, ANZ bridge) the central location makes it a worthwhile stay. In fact, if your room does face Darling Harbour - you can enjoy a 10 min fireworks display, which takes place on certain Saturdays of the week, in the comfort of your own room. Though my room was sfacing the highway, I am pleasantly surprised that there is almost 0 traffic noise in the rooms. Those of you whom are driving - please note that this hotel only allows valet parking which cost 45 AuD per parking even though you are the guest of the hotel. Nothing to scream about regards to the stay, but certainly a comfortable one The hotel give you a choice of harbour view rooms and city view rooms. Personally, the harbour view rooms are the ones to go for if you want a room with fantastic view, with Sydney harbour and the Opera House as the backdrop - it has a truly impressive view. I am a little surprise the 5 star hotel does not come with bathroom slippers, but I guess it is designed more like a service apartment - henceforth, no bathroom slippers? It is a great place for more than a week-long stays for business leisure as it has a little area for cooking and laundry ( washing machine and dryer included). There is even a mircowave, a kettle, utensils in the kitchenette- it will be perfect for a family holiday with small children. Services are short of 5 stars however - it has problems with its airconditioning and heating. Although they were kind to offer a room change, it was made through a 7 am early morning phone call! To not miss out a new room offer ( they did not offer to keep the new room for at least a few more hours), there was a mad rush to get out of the room early in the morning, jet lagged, day 2 of the stay, minutes before a business meeting. Although a safe box is availble, it wasn't working...called reception 3 times on 3 different days and they offer to repair it each time, but nobody turned up....I was basically in the room for a week without a funcitoning security deposit box - on a lighter note....the place is so secure....maybe there is no need for one, especially I tend to travel cheap and light? :) I am however satisfied of the stay...I guess the location is really unbeatable...The Rocks is just down the road!! It really make the stay so pleasant!! Some hiccups in terms of services but....not something to stop me from returning I guess...especially if the price is right ! So will recommend if the price is right! This place is not for the faint-hearted whom has a fix idea what bathroom, bed room, toilets, hotel rooms suppose to be. Lloyd hotel is a building with an interesting history - ex detention centre, ex immigrants' centre etc - you need to really see for yourself to appreciate how brilliantly interior designers/architects turn this institution, almost hospital-like architecture to a Hotel. I chose a 3 star room, in the basement , although I am a frequent traveller, it took me about 10 mins to orientate myself in the room and realize how my prior concepts about how rooms should be is rather strong. There are no doors for the toilet and shower (a forest shower) which is both seperated by a wall. The shower 'room' or more like compartment is so massive , it can fit 10 people easily. Room is extremely clean, and the bed I have to say has the most comfortable duvet and mattress i have ever slept in!!! I love the duvet so much I almost bought a Llyod Hotel design duvet .... I kinda regret not having at least the pillow case.... The uniqueness of the bed placement translates to comfort and privacy (huge contrast to the openess of the bathroom)- king size bed fitted snugly into a what looks like a cubic cove in the room - with the walls of the cove painted bright yellow - creating a funky contrast to the contemporary grey walls and wardrobes in the rest of the room.... Would I come back again? a definite YES - a mere 10 min train ride away from town, comfortable beds and clean rooms, the never boring interior design filled with character. Although there is occasional frustration as there are usually only 1 person serving a few at the reception - but hey, you are in Amsterdam - what's the rush for? :) Because I was here for a business trip - location is all it matters, this hotel is 3 mins away from Sants Station which is very convenient. The lobby of the hotel is really modern, but not when I stepped into the lifts and then the room afterwards. I was on Level 6. Rooms are Decent really - good size - but it look pretty tired like in the 80s. The bathroom has a bath tub with a shower head - they have soap and shampoo from a dispenser. Good size bathroom except I think they have problems with their drainage system I thought I can smell the pipes everytime I walked in. There is a temperature control on the wall but I think it doesn't work at all. The room was really warm in March, I have to open the windows.","Liked this hotel. Price wise it was worth it as well. Had a problem with my room (door didn't open) and this was appropriately dealt with by staff. Staff at reception was friendly and helpful. Would go here again. Close to train station. The rooms are adequate, however being a room for 3 they just put an extra bed and there was no space to move. However for the price compared to other hotels in Barcelona it was good value. Breakfast was over rated and there is no room service unless if you want to order in pizza! Was with my husband (he was on a business trip) and we had a nice, modern decor room. The beds were totally awful, you basically sink in them. I loved the hardwood floors but given that the isolation wasn't very good, they probably should have chosen carpet flooring. You could hear people in the next rooms, as well as people walking in the hallway. It seems like a half-hearted renovation: the elevators were quite ancient, and our magnetic keys had to be replaced pretty much every day. Breakfast buffet OK (there is no restaurant or bar, just a breakfast room) with some hot food which is not the norm in Spain. Wi-fi is free in the (small) lobby, although only in 30 minute increments so you have to keep asking for a new code. On the other hand, good price for value, extremely convenient to the metro (Les Corts), with super easy access to Sants train station, and Fira on Placa Espanya. Very quiet, relatively upscale neighborhood with lots of local shops, bars, and cafes. Police station a block away so assuming it is also quite safe! It's not an ultra modern or boutique hotel but certainly get by...I mean Barcelona is so exciting , tons of sight-seeing, activities - you really won't spend lots of time in the hotel. It's actually not too small, great if you are there alone - it gets a little cram if you share it with someone. The toilet didn't work for the last 2.5 days of the one week stay, couldn't flush, they couldn't fix it , although they offered to change the room - I was really too comfy to change ...4 days staying in the same room with stuff all over the place - the last time you wanna do is to include packing into the itinerary in SPain! Good thing is they aren't too pushy of getting us out of the room , although they try by insisting at first telling us there are major changes need to be done to the room. After that I realized that they have asked several other of my colleagues to moved out of their room as well.....hmmmm.... Their balconies face directly at a residential building opposite - so remember to draw your curtains! Very simple reception, very simple breakfast - there are scramble eggs and sausage links and of course all the cold cuts: breakie european style.

This hotel is not central but has great transport links fight to the heart of the city.....Underground - Green Line 3 and Bus 66 are the best (both 1.30 Euros) ask for Placa Catalunya when you get started...its the ""city centre"" and at the top of La Rambla. The hotel is on a street corner with loads of traffic but this was no problem and it was quiet in the rooms. The hotel and room was spotlessly clean and efficiently services daily. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and mostly english speaking willing to give loads of detail about the city....just ask. The breakfasts were far too expensive and it was much better to go to one of the many local cafes to get a great breafast for a third of the price!. There are loads of Restaurants and Bar all around. The bars stop outside eating and drinking at midnight when it all moves inside to you want to stop. There is great shopping 5 mins up on the Diagonal... Camp Nou is really easy to walk to and if you want to do an open-top bus a stop is within easy walking where you can also get the tickets - this is a stop for both the blue and red routes - BBT (Barcelona Bus Touristic) was the best and cheapest option. Barcelona is a great city and to see it all this turned out to be a great base!!.",,,
Timothy Y,1980393,The service provided is average. The food is average. Room key needs to be changed after room service. The taxis in front of the hotel always over charge passengers. The facilities in the conference room are average. I confirmed the room in this hotel but they told me that their rooms were overbooked when I arrived. And they wanted to transfer me to a 3 star hotel. Don't trust this hotel!,"i had a business trip to istanbul last week,every thing is small but clean and new,the hotel has just renewed,the staff are so friendly that you can find it rarely in other hotel in turkeybut its noisy because of libian people who are there.the libian people argue always and talk loud all the time I confirmed the room in this hotel but they told me that their rooms were overbooked when I arrived. And they wanted to transfer me to a 3 star hotel. Don't trust this hotel! The hotel is located close to the Yenikapi train station (soon also with subway connection). It is in walking distance (20 min) to many of Istanbul's sights. The quarter is full of other small hotels. The house is modernized, rooms are small, but functional. The breakfast room in the top floor has a panoramic view of the Marmara Sea. Service is o.k., breakfast is included and has enough Turkish flavor to get in the mood. Sty there, when you need something acceptable at fair rates.",,,
wellensian,232817,"Location: Superb corner location in tree-lined street surrounded by high class shops in the Salamanca district. Owned by NH but quite different in feel. Rooms are spacious and light but furnished more cheaply than the usual NH. The floors are some sort of laminate and the furniture is stuck-on veneer rather than wood. Replacement light bulbs could not be found. On the other hand the bathrooms seem to be where all the money was spent and are excellent (except that they provide shampoo from a wall dispenser rather than the usual NH toiletries). Staff: The staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful but sparse in number, consisting, for most of the day, of a single receptionist attempting to handle three checkouts while answering all telephone enquiries, (there must also be cleaners etc) All in all, the hotel is perfectly satisfactory, but could use an NH upgrade and with youth unemployment at an all-time high in Spain, would benefit from more staff. The fourth star reflects the location and service rather than the accommodation (which alone would be a 3) furniture I chose this hotel because I needed to be close to Line 5 on the Metro for work. An OK hotel, reasonably well located in quiet bourgeois area on the edge of the Barrio Salamanca, 5 minutes walk from the Metro. I rejected the initial room offered, looking over a dingy well, and requested an exterior room, which I was given immediately. It pays to ask for an exterior room upon check-in. Typical NH room with wooden floor and good, if slightly cramped, marble bathroom Comfortable bed and good shower with plenty of hot water. The whole hotel has a 1970s feel and will soon need some updating, particularly to the corridors (ill-fitting carpets on their last legs), and to the creacked marble in the bathroms. In particular the Internet connection did not appear to work at all well. For the second week in Madrid, I stayed with NH, but moved to one of their better properties. The whole place is a symphony in marble..............deep Pyrenean green marble in the lobby, white marble throughout in the bedrooms. You really knew you were in Spain...even the corridors had that agreeable faint smell of old-fashioned Eau de Cologne that all Spaniards used to favour. Staff were most obliging: I asked for an exterior room with balcony if possible, and they had a very good room available, if i did not mind going on the smoking floor. In the event, I reckon that nobody had smoked in the room for months, so no problem. The room was the most unusual and original I have stayed in for a long time. There was a marble-floored corridor, leading to an area with wardrobe and marble topped basin area (with fresh flower). A separate door led to the rest of the bathroom. At the end of the corridor was the door to the bedroom, which opened into an area 5 feet above the bedroom floor, so that the first item was a marble staircase leading into the body of the room. Even the workspace was marble topped, and the other furnishings were modern and interesting. I was told that some singles are rather small and that I had the best available at the time. This is the sort of hotel I really like, respectful of the 19th century exterior, while modernised yet characterful inside. Facilities were remarkable for a city centre hotel, with even a swimming pool on the roof. For a the second of a 2 week business trip I picked this hotel for its location in town, but almost next to Alonso Martinez Metro station (for Line 5), having spent the first week at the less interesting NH Balboa. Being in an old building, the rooms vary enormously, and, as usual it is wise to request an exterior room, as interior rooms can be dingy. Anyone needing complete quiet would be advised to avoid this hotel on a main road just off a large traffic junction, but if urban noise does not bother you, it is fine. Most of the rooms are large with polished wood floors and the usual NH furnishings, supplemented at this hotel with stained glass shields in the windows. My bathroom was enormous, with both a bath and the largest walk-in shower I have ever encountered. Condition was a little tired, but this did not detract from the general experience. The restaurant and bar are currently closed for refurbishment, but a good breakfast is served, with plenty of fruit, cold meats, tortilla, croissants etc. and, as always in Spain, good strong coffee. The hotel suited my purposes well and I would certainly stay there again.","Chosen for it's proximity to friends we were visiting and also near the metro station. Hotel was very quiet, probably the season. Room was a bit dark and dreary but the bed was fine. Room rate was excellent considering. Rooms definitely need renovation. Location isn't that bad. Good breakfasts. This is the fourth NH hotel we have booked. We stayed from the 5/312 to the 9/3/12They are used a lot for conferences and by business travellers as well as tourists so you know what to expect. We got it on a flash discount sale of 50% off no cancellation or refund. I think we would have been dissapointed if we paid full price. The interior of ths one seemed a bit tiired but it was very clean and in a very good location just adjacent to Playa Santa Barbera about 20/30 minutes walk away from the the centre which can get very boisterous at night. We paid for an upgrade to a superior room and got a very big room with a huge bathroom. Breakfast was adequate. They don't put the eggs and bacon out they cook it fresh for you so don't think there isn't any just order it. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. To get from the airport we booked the shuttle Aerocity. It was only 16 Euros for two peopple whereas a taxi would cost you about 40E. We used them to get back to the airport. You can get the tube but there are lots of steps to negotiate and I wouldn't recommend it with cases or at peak times. Madrid is very spread out and full of traffic so we used the tube a lot. Buy a three day pass for 13E and it's unlimted and included the buses. Watchout for the pickpockets on the tube and in the centre as they tried to get into my wifes bag twice. There are lots of prostitutes between the Gran Via and Sol which you might find distasteful as they also operate in broad daylight My husband and i travelled here between christmas and new year and spent 3 nights at the Embajada. I thought this hotel was ideal. We could walk, a very pleasant walk, into the centre (Sol) in around 30 minutes. There was a great little breakfast place ( a smoothie bar) with fab bagels, crossiants etc just across the road on the corner. Cheap too. The hotel was value for money. Our room was spacious as was the en suite with a bath too. A few pubs around the area and right next to the Metro station if you dont want to walk home from the center. Took about 10mins by metro. The staff were very helpful and friendly and spoke English. If i had any critisism then it would be that our room looked into the central courtyard ( if you can call it that) and made the room dimly lit and the double bed - which was 2 singles together keep drifting apart! But we were hardly in room as so much to see in city. i would definetly return to this hotel - but ask for a room facing the outside! Excellent location beside a metro station with many residential buildings close by. A few good restaurants and a market nearby as well. Staff members speak English and are very accomodating. Rooms are clean and comfortable. WIFI not so reliable. I chose this hotel because it was closest to where my daughter was staying while she is studying in Madrid for school. I was pleasant surprised to have 2 rooms for our stay; a small sitting area with a table and 2 chairs and a padded bench for sitting. the closet has shelves for clothing storage on one side and hanging area on the other. There were 2 twin beds pushed together in the bedroom, a desk/chair, 2 nightstands and a chest with a TV. there is a mini bar/fridge in the chest. the bathroom is large and very clean. This was a great place for us to stay and it is close to the Metro and walking distance to many great places to eat. We did not eat in the hotel but if you are looking for a substanstial breakfast, I suggest finding a VIPS to eat at. The VIPS are great for travellers as they also stock a small supply of prepared foods, a few groceries, and even alcoholic beverages. There is one a short distance from this hotel. I would stay here again if I ever get back to Madrid. Good quality and comfort although I expected a better breakfast. The price was right and the location, but I don't spend too much time in the room. I am thinking to book in another NH Hotel, I usually go for work. Hotel is located in a nice part of the center. Clean rooms in an renovated old appartment building. Great breakfest. You can order fresh cooked supplements at no extra charge. In my opinion the hotel deserves a higher Tripadvisor rating. Rob Im a little late in writing this review but I stayed here with a friend in September 2009. We stayed here for 5 days and had a nice experience. The location was great, very close to the metro and an easy walk to many places also. The rooms were clean, spacious, and the bathroom was very big. We did not eat at the hotel, nor did we really ask for help from the staff so cannot comment on either, but overall had a nice experience and the location made staying here worth it. The best feature of Embajada hotel is the position, right outside the center, so that the area is quiet and you can very easily reach it if you have a car, but the town center is still at walking distance (15 min). The rooms are reasonably clean and spacious. In particular you have roller blinds to get dark, not only curtains (not so obvious in Spain). A negative aspect is that some rooms face really close another building that is just something like 5 meters far so that you can't see the sky outside. So if possible ask for a room with view on the street. The breakfast is not included but really good and rich, so it is worth paying. There's a free wifi in the lobby (not perfectly performing though) but if you want it in the room is about 5 euro per hour. For a the second of a 2 week business trip I picked this hotel for its location in town, but almost next to Alonso Martinez Metro station (for Line 5), having spent the first week at the less interesting NH Balboa.

The restaurant and bar are currently closed for refurbishment, but a good breakfast is served, with plenty of fruit, cold meats, tortilla, croissants etc. and, as always in Spain, good strong coffee. The hotel suited my purposes well and I would certainly stay there again. NH Embajada is located a few meters from Alonso Martinez metro stop which means it is perfect for visitors to Madrid. We took the metro from the airport, and with one change were at the hotel within 45 minutes for the grand price of 2 euros! Check in was smooth, room was ready and clean. One small problem was that the housemaid had not left soap etc. A quick trip to reception solved the problem and from then on, shampoo, soap etc were replaced when used up. Rooms facing the back of the hotel (a wall) are quiet. The breakfast buffet is excellent: cereals, juices, breads, rolls, sweet rolls, bacon, eggs, chorizo, cheeses, tortilla, ham, fresh fruits, yoghurts, etc etc. The breakfast staff were courteous and willing but sometimes overwhelmed when numbers were great. WiFi is free in the lobby (30 minute intervals which can be ""renewed""), but expensive in the rooms (â¬5 for 30 minutes, â¬10 for 24 hours - continuous). There is a mini bar in the room. A supermarket is 2 blocks away. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Check out was also smooth and quick. NH Embajada is a perfect place to stay in Madrid. We would definitely stay there again and have no hesitation recommending the hotel to anyone visiting Madrid for tourism or business.",,,
TroubledAditi,502358,"Stayed here in May 2010. You might find this hotel a suitable option if you intend to do a lot of sightseeing in Sultanahmet and won't spend much time in the hotel room. My room had a nice view to the Suleiman mosque but that could not make up the poor maintenance of the room. It was very dusty and dirty. The cleaning staff didn't change the plastic bag of the bathroom rubbish bin, just took the rubbish out of it. When I decided to change the bag myself I discovered the rubbish bin was so dirty that my hands smelled for a couple of hours afterwards, despite of washing. The hotel has good amenities but they are not free of charge for the customers. Using the tiny pool on the rooftop costs 10 euro. On the ground floor they have a sauna but it would have cost some 30 dollars to use it. This hotel seems to be favoured by Russian tourist groups. They also have Russian satellite channels on TV. I didn't like Sultanahmet area especially much. The vendors on the streets and in the Grand Bazaar are very pushy and everybody was talking to me in Russian (I am not Russian even though I look like it). If you are not very much into the touristy thing stay in Taksim instead of Sultanahmet! Istanbul has very good public transport and a ticket costs only 1,5 lira. You may hop into the metro straight at the AtatÃÂ¼rk airport. I went to the Asian side (ÃÅskudar) twice just because it's fun to ride a ferry across Bosphorus. There are several docks on the both sides where you can catch a ferry. I wanted to stay in this area as I had had good experiences here a couple of years before. Indeed, for going out the location is excellent, very safe and lots of nightclubs nearby. And yet it's close to Dubai Creek and the souqs. The ""studio"" was probably the biggest hotel room/apartment I've ever stayed at. Also the bathroom was huge and kitchen well-equipped. The hotel is a bit worn-out but everything was clean, apart from the toilet bowl brush which definitely needed to be replaced. Self-catering is easy, both Spinneys and Choitrams are close by. But the hotel also has two Indian restaurants. Personally I very much enjoyed having several Indian channels on TV. The pool area could be improved... the pool is on the rooftop and you can surely get a good tan, but the temperature of the water should be controlled. Already in April the water was almost too hot for swimming. The gym is next to the pool, the equipment old but functioning. Service was a bit rude, both when checking in and when checking out. The hotel offers free airport transfers but I was flying via Abu Dhabi and only needed to go to the Etihad office (which is much closer than Dubai airport!) but they said no, we only offer complimentary transfer to the airport. It's difficult to find a modestly priced hotel in L.A. I ended up in here for four nights. My first impressions were quite confused. This area of the city is populated by Mexican, South American, Russian and Armenian immigrants and is not very glamorous. The hotel room was quite dark and not especially comfortable. The was a good TV and a fridge anyway. And the hotel swimming pool was a few steps from my door which was a huge plus. The breakfast is nothing to mention about - it's best that you just take the coffee to your room in carton cups and self-cater. There is an excellent supermarket nearby and lots of ethnic restaurants. The metro station is a few minutes walk from the hotel. I had a 5 days metro card and went around by the most clean and organised subway system I've ever seen.One day I took a metro to Long Beach. It took a long time to get there but the palce is awesome - if I ever go to L.A. again I will stay at Long Beach.","Stayed here in May 2010.

It's really wonderful,we feel ourselves in our home becouse of the kindness of the reception staff there..since we make reservation untill we leave Istanbul they are with us with thier gentleness...Frankly they act the most important rule in the hotel..you can find alot of hotels with testy food , clean room and nice view but-with my respect to all- you cant find polite staff like Grand Gulsoy staff.. thanx for all Mohamed Al-Shareef Family I have been there with my husband and two young children last Sept 2009 for 1 week. They gave us a room which was so dark and hot despite Istanbul's pleasant wether, but they gave us an additional fan which helped us to sleep well. Staff (specially receptionists) are not friendly that much but they are respectful. Location is very good and near to shopping centers. Generally it was a good hotel to stay. I went there with my friends, they are so friendly ... they are trying to give u all u need , very available , so cheap for the services that u have, so TOP , panorama so beautiful of SHEZADE e SULAIMANY mosque , so near to all sevices and trasportations. bellissimo ,stupendo , ci andrei tutte le volte !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,,
aziobro,622790,"The contemporary design of the spacious rooms was amazing. The constant pounding noise from the music clubs along the street is unbearable, especially at 2:30 in the morning. Not a place for the a restful night sleep. Although the double rooms were miniscule, this botique hotel is a gem. Every staff member was completely dedicated to amazing hospitality. The rooftop bar with a stunning view of the Blue Mosque is such a treat and the Turkish breakfast was the best we experienced in out travels.","Misafir is undoubtedly in fantastic location but the noise level is extraordinary - and unrelenting every night (we were there across both weekend and weeknights - the live music from next door seems to be popular every night and morning of the week). We wouldn't have slept in any meaningful way for the three nights we were there. Ideal for those who would like to be out till 4 or 5 every night; more challenging for people who want to see Istanbul during the day. The rooms are enormous and have great bathrooms and spare couches, desks etc, and are nicely decorated, which makes a nice change from small hotel rooms. I spent a week at Misafir suites. And from the day I arrived to the day I left, the team at the hotel made my stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. As for the hotel itself, the room was absolutely terrific with the location being right at the heart of Taksim square. If anybody wants to go to Istanbul, I would highly recommend Misafir to you! On my next trip to Istanbul, I will most definitely stay at the hotel again. There is a very nice restaurant on the roof of the hotel which is quite a hotspot with the locals. I unfortunately only went there on my last day but I would highly recommend it. On a final, I want to send a special thanks to Goker and the rest of the guys who very helpful! The contemporary design of the spacious rooms was amazing. The constant pounding noise from the music clubs along the street is unbearable, especially at 2:30 in the morning. Not a place for the a restful night sleep. The location of the hotel is in a centered neighborhood very closed to many eating places,bars,shops and many other ""hot spots"" of the city in addition with the service provided by the hotel personnel who are efficient and always smiling and very helpful made my stay in Istanbul ""unforgettable"" The rooms at this hotel are huge, well appointed, and very comfortable. The staff, most notably concierge extraordanaire Goker, are friendly, knowledgeable, and great for getting the inside scoop on Istanbul. The area where this hotel is located is loud, quite loud actually, But that is the the trade off for being right in the heart of Taksim. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel and it shouldn't be an issue. Definitely would recommend this place. We stayed in the Misafir Suites two nights in March 2010. The suite is very spacious and luxury. The interior of the suites is very stylish with amongst others a great bed, lounge sofa and desk for you laptop. Excellent and free wifi, flatscreen TV, dvd-player, etc. The bathroom is spacious as well with a huge bath and luxury bath accessoires. The location is great as well. When you exit the building you're right in the heart of everything (bars, restaurants, shops, etc.). And you even don't have to leave the building, because the owner runs a great restaurant/club in the building. And yes, it is a bit noisy, but that goes with the central location. If I return to Istanbul I will definitely stay here again.",,,
maccogirl,226658,"This is THE place to stay if you are visiting Silver Dollar City. There is no traffic to fight. You can be in your hotel room in two or three minutes after getting to your car at SDC. It is clean, large rooms, breakfast provided, pool, convenience store adjacent (also with a small bar). I wouldn't stay here if you are going to shows in Branson (too far out), but I will never stay anywhere else when going to SDC. I bought a coupon for this motel from a local tv station (price $33), so it was definitely worth the money. First, it is not a Super 8. We learned the owner/manager has three hotels--this one, Super 8, and Dockers Inn. The Plantation Inn is directly behind the Plantation Restaurant on west 76. If you are looking for a big sign, you will miss it. It is three-stories, but it is built on a hill, so two of the floors are very accessible (didn't see an elevator to the third floor). On the ground floor you can park in front of your room. On the second floor you park and walk up three small steps. Room was clean, beds comfortable, AC worked and was quiet, sink/dressing area was outside the bath area. Wi-Fi included. No refrig/microwave. Breakfast consisted of cereal and toast, coffee and juice. Small pool was clean. There was nothing really special about this location, but there was nothing to complain about. I booked this hotel through Hotwire, and I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were extra large, having room for two queen beds plus a table--and lots of extra room. We had a microwave and refrigerator. The beds and pillows were great, and the breakfast was enough to start you for the day. It was definitely quiet at night. We were surprised to find so many were there! I go to Branson a great deal, and this would be one place I will definitely tell others about. I only paid $33 on Hotwire.","Booked the hotel months in advance. The wi-fi did not work when we were there and we were told it had not been working for days. The beds were comfortable. There were open cracks in the wall/ceiling junctions (I am finding that in a lot of hotels lately on this trip). There were short black hairs on the tub/shower walls and in the tub. We noticed this in the morning after staying the night. That is not acceptable. Housekeeping is slacking... The location was convenient. Will NEVER stay here again. Travel to Branson about 10 times a year and this was the WORST. Frist, sent to the wrong room, had not even been touched by housekeeping. Second, Wifi worked about 20 minutes out of the 4 days I was there. I asked to speak with the manager and was told she was in a meeting and would call me back, even took my cell number, did she call HELL NO. If she don't care, then I don't either. Hotel wasn't booked with motorcycle rallies in town so I guess this has happened before. I live in Arkansas and have many friends that go to Branson because of the distance and will NOT be giving this place any business by word of mouth. Stay away from this place!!! Pay a little more, it will be worth it. Oh yeah, Air conditioner didn't work the first night. Would cool off to about 70 and then shut down and not turn back on till it was about 85. Again, stay away from this place!!! I bought a coupon for this motel from a local tv station (price $33), so it was definitely worth the money. First, it is not a Super 8.

Stayed here for the weekend. Check-in was a breeze. Room was clean and comfortable. Beds were nice. Location was very good, one block from 76 right on the yellow route. The continental breakfast was better than average, they offer waffles, biscuts and gravy, etc. Overall, very clean place, good location, and great for the price. Would definately stay here again and would recommend to anyone. A+. Clean room, comfortable bed, friendly staff and nice pool for the kids.T.his hotel is located just off the main drag in Branson. We would stay here again. The contential breakfast includes cold items such as donuts, toast, cereal, juice and coffee. Microwavable oatmeal is available.",,,
Shamichael,237386,"Stayed for 2 nights with mostly a positive experience. Positives: - Very helpful and friendly service - Fairly clean rooms - Efficient housekeeping - Decent buffet breakfast in the restaurant Negatives: - Quite far from the train station, approx 20mins+ walk. More worse if your lugging around luggage. - Shower curtain did not keep the water in the shower. - Older style hotel and furnishing. - Average ventilation. Overall, the pleasant service outweighed the negatives. Crosti Apartments, which i thought was Crosti Hotel at the time of booking did not disappoint one bit. Roughly a few mins from the actual Crosti Hotel, the apartment is quite generous in size, consisting of a lounge room, functional kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and a fantastic rooftop terrace. Another lil gem is the addition of a Nespresso Coffee machine. All kitchen cookware are there along with a washing machine. Overall, we had a very pleasent stay with friendly staff who helped us alone the way during our first visit to Rome. Pros: - Very friendly and helpful staff - Nice buffet breakfast to start the day (Variety is the same everyday however) - Large rooms with nice little extras such as coffee machine, washing machine, etc - Great place to stay if you are expecting visitors as there is an additional sofa bed in the lounge room - Wi-Fi Internet available (Was complimentary during our trip) - Large fridge and electronic safe in the apartment. Cons: - 10-15min walk from Termini Station, although close to the next station up on the Rome Metro - Hot water system was a bit off the mark. Hot water on the shower ran out quite quickly and it was hard to regulate to the right temperature - Walls are slightly thin. Could hear the young kids from next door. Overall: Still a fantastic experience. Not perfect but the friendly and helpful staff and the extra amenities such as the washing machine and coffee machine made up for it.","Wonderful, wonderful hotel. perfect location, great food. Can't wait to go back again! Stayed for 2 nights with mostly a positive experience. Positives: - Very helpful and friendly service - Fairly clean rooms - Efficient housekeeping - Decent buffet breakfast in the restaurant Negatives: - Quite far from the train station, approx 20mins+ walk. More worse if your lugging around luggage. - Shower curtain did not keep the water in the shower. - Older style hotel and furnishing. - Average ventilation. Overall, the pleasant service outweighed the negatives. we recently stayed at the hotel malibran for 2 nights. we are a family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers. we had a fairly large room on the 3rd floor with essentially 4 single beds, 2 of which were pushed together. our room had a small hallway at the entrance which made it seem more spacious. the bathroom was small- only room for 1 person at a time, with a spectacular towel heater. the room itself was quite pleasant with beautiful views of the neighboring church. there was a tiny t.v. with italian only channels, a safe, and old- fashioned radiator heaters. the hallways were a bit dingy and didn't seem to get vacuumed daily. the breakfast was quite good, and we made sandwiches from it that we ate for lunch! the restaurant in the hotel is quite good and relatively cheap for venice. the location is fairly good- about a 5 minute walk from the rialto bridge and a 10 minute walk from piazza san marco and ca d'oro. the staff were quite professional and pleasant. overall, this was a fantastically economical place to stay in venice for our family of four without compromising location or quality!! Firstly the hotel is in a great location, an easy walk to the Rialto bridge. The rooms were clean but small. Hardly any room for the suitcases, but I imagine that a lot of rooms in Venice are small. Also the decor was a bit old and the bathroom was tiny. Breakfast was nice - a cold buffet in the restaurant downstairs. It had plenty to choose from. The restaurant was nice too. Service at reception was good and were friendly and helpful. They also helped us book a trip to Murano island that cost us nothing but the water bus back. That was a great deal. So even though it was small and a bit oldish, I would definitely stay here again. The location was excellent and the price in comparison to other hotels on the island was really good. And it was clean. This hotel is in a fantastic location, just off the central shopping street, great locations for dinner, and the restaurant downstairs was nice. The room was decent, though there was four of us jammed into one room. However, it wasn't horribly uncomfortable. Would definitely stay there again! This hotel was excellent for us. We wanted somewhere reasonably priced, central to Venice and clean. We got that and some breakfast as well! So clean, the maid must have been trained in a hospital! Much cleaner than my own home and I like clean! Breakfast was simple European. Filled me up! Bed was small but comfortable. Bathroom small but useful and clean. TV - small but useful and worked (do you see a pattern). Room. Simple, small, clean and cosy. My daughters and I stayed here in December. The hotel suited our purposes very well. It was clean and tidy and the staff were more than helpful. The location is great as you are only 5-7 minutes from San Marco and 2 minutes from Rialto so you have the best of both. The restaurant was great. The room was a good size for European standards and had very clean bathrooms. Baggage is always a problem to move around in Europe, travellers need to remember these buildings were built before the invention of lifts. Would stay again as I think the when in Venice you need to be out of your hotel room and experience the city. This is a little gem. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel at all. Located just a few minutes from The Rialto bridge it is in the middle of everything. Our room seemed to be newly refurbished and was overlooking the small piazza in front of the Malibran theater. As always the rooms in Venice is quite small, but that is not where you spend the time anyway so we didn't bother. The beds where spacious and comfy. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends going to Venice. Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. It was extremly clean, and had such a fantastic location (right behind the house Marco Polo lived in and about a 2 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge). The staff at the hotel and the resturant were very friendly and were willing to help us with any queries we had. It was also great that the hotel had many connections with other resturants, etc, that gave us discounts. Because of this we had an incredible dinner on the banks of the Grand Canal over looking the Rialto bridge. Throughly enjoyed the whole experience, the only downfall was trying to take heavy suitcases down quite a few flights of stairs because our section of the hotel did not have an elevator. Overall brillant hotel. The Hotel Malibran was a fantastic hotel for our Venice experience. Conveniently located 5 mins from Rialto bridge and in the heart of great and reasonably priced restaurants. The staff were so helpful,m letting us leave our luggage free of charge until we were ready to get picked up and letting us use their printer in a small crisis. They made us feel welcome and allowed us to enjoy our holiday without feeling pressured for room cleaning and check out times. We enjoyed the size and layout of the hotel which allowed us to unpack a little after backpacking for a month!! great to have decent toiletries supplied also. We loved that when relaxing in our room we could open the windows and shutters to hear the streets sounds of Venice or close them up and get some real quiet time. Malibran Hotel gives you privacy, and feels out of the hustle and bustle; yet you are five minutes from the Rialto Bridge on foot, and about 15 minutes from the San Marco Square. Their breakfasts were excellent, european fare; as were the dinners. Hotel was very clean, but the rooms were small. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room, it was big enough for suitcases and wardrobe, but not much else. Be prepared to climb stairs, but the hotel provides porters. There was one computer in the lobby with 30 minutes for $5. The hotel is near the original home of Marco Polo, and once you are near the Rialto Bridge you can catch the vaporetto for anywhere in the city. These water buses are well marked; and we paid very little for full access to the entire city. Study the maps before you go. The managers were friendly but you had to get their attention; their English was mediocre. We loved it and will stay there again. Brava. I felt like I was in a bedroom not a hotel. The staff was not that helpful but the location was great. I too read the reviews and it all depends on your expectations, finances and the personnel involved. I thought the Malibran was more than adequate. Situauted only few minutes walk from the Rialto bridge and waterstop. Lots of cafes, bars and eating places nearby.( Try the Dolphin for spaghetti and clams 11 euros). The room we had was in the newer block across from the breakfast area, double bed, 3 windows with shutters, bathroom, fridge and air con ( 37 degrees outside) and a free 3 course dinner for 2 as well ( special offer in July). Breakfast was typical continental buffet style with red orange juice!! As it was very hot we took a waterbus to the Lido and swam in the sea which was warm and relaxing. The photos of rooms online are very misleading. The rooms are tiny, dingy and shabby. Our toilet was so close to the wall, we had to sit on it sideways. Taking a shower meant spraying the entire bathroom and part of the room as well. One member in our group actually had the toilet under the shower! One room smelled so badly it was disgusting. The one concierge who was friendly and helpful left for vacation and the two remaining were unfriendly and very unwilling to help. The food in the restaurant was slightly above average. Some of the wait staff were friendly and attentive, some were not.",,,
leicestermancunian,238722,"It was great to have the extra room afforded by this mini apartment. The room was very quiet, clean with pleasant decor. It was great to be able to have a cup of tea first thing although otherwise we didn't use the catering facilities, there's an excellent cafe next to the metro 5 mins away where you can get a great bacon sandwich. About 25 mins walk to Ramblas or go on the metro, cheap clean and efficient. Acacia highly recommended. A couple of minutes from termini so a doddle to get anywhere. The staff were very helpful, the rooms pleasant although there is quite a lot of traffic noise. Breakfasts basic although I wouldn't expect anything more in most European cities. There are lots of English speaking guests so one thing that would have been nice would be the facility to get just one English speaking news channel on the tv.","We stayed 5 days at the Aparthotel in February, had a pretty large room, 2 separate beds as requested, a small sitting-area, a kitchen (no waterheater or coffeemaking-facilities; that's complementary) and a large bathroom. Everything was perfectly clean. Staff was friendly. No complaints about noise, quiet and safe (Eixample) area. But: the whole day and night the room is hot and there's no way to regulate this. The window can be opened but won't stay open. I found it rather uncomfortable to sleep in this atmosphere. We didn't take breakfast at the hotel, there are plenty of opportunities in the neigbourhood (we ate nearby for â¬ 3,50 per person each morning). Tip: small cheap good restaurant: Taverna d'Urgell near the hotel. Location 50 meters from metro Hospital de Clinic. Finding a used condom under the bed was so disgusting that I almost forgot about the view leading to a wall, the telephone that took 36 hours to be replaced, the breakfast that came incomplete and the breakfast order that was ignored altogether. Calling this a 4* hotel is a joke. Very easy to find from the metro stop; about 60 metres. A wide selection of bars, restaurants and small shops nearby. Very efficient check in an check out. The room was of a very good standard with a small two element electric stove. Wi-fi was good. We needed a cork screw and one was produced for us within ten miutes - very pleasing! We also arrived a little early and the room was ready for us. We bought a two day transport pass, which included the train trip from the airport to the aparthotel from the information desk within the arrivals hall. We chose Aparthotel Acacia for a 5-day trip to Barcelona, and were drawn to it for three reasons: a previous positive experience at an apart-hotel in Berlin, an excellent rate, and free Wi-Fi. We could not be more pleased with our choice! The hotel is located in the Eixample neighborhood very near an L5 metro stop, and is a reasonable walking distance from La Pedrera/Casa Batllo. There are plenty of excellent restaurants, cafes, and shops in the surrounding blocks, and high-end shopping on Passeig de Gracia is within 15 min. on foot. Rooms are cozy and efficiently decorated, and the cleaning staff kept both the room space and public areas immaculate. The free Wi-Fi service was unfailingly stable, and it was a real treat to be able to Skype with our kids while we were away. Most importantly, the staff provided customer service as good as any hotel we have patronized in the US or abroad. The reception staff patiently and courteously provided answers to our questions, outstanding recommendations for transportation and eating, and were ready to make us as comfortable as possible in every regard. We loved Barcelona and would readily have added a few more days to the trip if it were possible, and our stay at Acacia was a big part of that sentiment! Meal service is available, but we chose not to partake of this. A few reviewers mentioned that the beds were very firm, and this is very much the case. Mattresses are firmer in Europe that those we are accustomed to in the States anyway, but these are really hard--something to consider if you prefer to really sink into your bed. Also, Carrer del Comte d'Urgell is a fairly busy street, and given the late hours the Spanish keep the traffic noise can go on well into the night. We were not terribly disturbed by this, but if you are used to very quiet nights, you should come prepared. If you are planning a trip to Barcelona, Aparthotel Acacia should absolutely be on your shortlist of potential hotels. We had a wonderful stay, and look forward to another if we are fortunate to return to Catalunya. we have just had a 4 nights stay at this hotel and cannot fault the helpfulness of the staff, they helped us map our tour of barcelona and the apartment was also kept very clean.. it was also close enough to the metro station to make it convenient in every way. we were a family of five and never felt cramped in any way.. i would certainly recommend it. My husband and I stayed at this aparthotel for 12 nights on the recommendation of friends. We had a wonderful time! It ticks all the boxes - excellent location, terrific staff, a comfortable and very clean room. Just as the others have mentioned - it is close to restaurants and bars, a small supermarket for groceries for the odd meal I cooked and the metro (Hospital Clinic) is 50 metres away. I can't stress how helpful and friendly the staff were - (with a special mention to Maurizio) - anything we needed was provided. For the length of time we spent in Barcelona, this aparthotel was ideal! We ceratinly hope to return sometime soon! You won't be disappointed. It was great to have the extra room afforded by this mini apartment. The room was very quiet, clean with pleasant decor. It was great to be able to have a cup of tea first thing although otherwise we didn't use the catering facilities, there's an excellent cafe next to the metro 5 mins away where you can get a great bacon sandwich. About 25 mins walk to Ramblas or go on the metro, cheap clean and efficient. Acacia highly recommended. The hotel very nice and clean. The lower rooms could hear running water from the upper rooms however it didnt spoil the stay. Friendly staff. After reading other reviews we asked for a kettle on arrival and also the key to the room safe (an additional cost) Very close to a metro station so made it easy to get around. Beware of pickpockets as we lost a camera in the lift going down into the metro I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (total of 8 people). The hotel is located in a quiet section of Barcelona that is very close to the Metro line. We booked two triple rooms and one double room. The triple room consisted of one double bed (two twin beds next to each other) and a fold out bed. The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean. The only issue I had with the room was the shower consisted of a glass door that did not fit the entire bathtub, and therefore when taking a shower the bathroom floor would get completely wet. However the shower did have consistent water pressure. The big reason why I recommend this hotel is because the customer service of the front desk was AMAZING! We are large family that can be very loud and demanding at times, and the hotel staff accommodated all of our needs with genuine courtesy and friendliness. We are planning to revisit this hotel at the end our Spain trip for one last night before we head back to the US. We stayed here on our way in and our way out of Spain. Clean, lovely rooms with divided section with loveseat that folds out to a small bed, table, small refrigerator, 2 burner stove, sink and various dishes and pots. If you want a microwave, you have to ask. Room is great for a couple. Probably OK with a small child, too. TV has some English channels, including British news and entertainment but sometimes there are problems with the signals. Wireless internet. You pay a small charge to use the in-room safe. Our first room faced the rear. No view but very quiet. The second room faced the street. There was some noise but not bad. We loved the neighborhood which is upscale and filled with families and students for the nearby school. The Metro is just a few steps away (Hospital Clinic stop, L5) and is easy to use. There are cafes and restaurants everywhere. Two grocery stores are a block away. Cash machines everywhere. If you walk a few blocks up Urgell, you can catch the Bus Turistic near Diagonal. Look for the sign on the west side of the street. The desk staff spoke English and were very helpful. We skipped the hotel breakfast which was expensive and the hotel laundry which cost more per item than the clothes were worth. We Americans are used to toiletries at hotels but you'll just get a liquid all purpose soap and a sewing kit! Bring your own shampoo and lotion. Although we had selected this property based on Trip Advisors, I was still wary of a well priced hotel in a good location. The suite (rooms without walls to the ceiling) was comfortable and spacious. The staff were great. We arrived with two personal problems - a stolen bag and a death in the family. The staff took messages, gave advice, and were very kind. The hotel is very close to a metro and has many restaurants of varying prices nearby. They have a small underground garage. Loved this place. Was very close to Metro Stations and within walking distance to some very good restaurants. Within walking distance to some great sites. Staff was very good and the place was spotless. Was nice to have the extra room for a great price.",,,
DCmetrodogmom,73810,"Stayed at the Aria for a business conference. First time in Vegas. PROS: 1. Rooms are modern and feature all necessary amenities plus so many more. The tech system (carefully explained in other reviews) is helpful and fun. The bed is soft as are the pillows. Very comfortable for sleep. 2. The spa is fabulous! I had a wonderful massage. The service was impeccable. I highly recommend you get a spa treatment! 3. Lemongrass restaurant and catering at our conference on-site were very good. CONS 1. Water not readily available at the pool, and towels are only located as you enter. Chairs would benefit from cushions and to make the pool more high-end. I also never saw a waitress for a drink order. Pool=not as good as hotel spa facility. 2. Aria nickle-and-dimes you: internet $15/day, spa/gym $30 day, bowl of fruit at cafe $7 3. The pool closes at 6 and the spa closes at 8. What about those of us who like these activities later in the day? If everything hadn't been paid for by the conference, I might have been more annoyed about the value, etc. That said, Aria seemed a lot nicer than other Vegas hotels I saw while touring around. I would recommend it to a friend. Stayed at the Aria for a business conference. First time in Vegas. PROS: 1. Rooms are modern and feature all necessary amenities plus so many more.

I would recommend it to a friend. Pros: 1. Clean space, which is v important to me 2. Clean duvet covers that get changed - hurrah! 3. Free wifi 4. Free shuttle that will take you downtown (this hotel is by IUPUI, so not near Circle Center) 5. On the IUPUI campus (have business here) 6. Front desk folks were helpful and welcoming Cons: 1. Walls were a little thin - could hear laughter in next room, and it didn't seem like the folks were being too raucous 2. Bed and pillows were a little hard. I prefer down. 3. Bathrooms were a little small given that this is Indiana and the rooms were large. Summary - If your business brings you near IUPUI, this is a good option. I haven't stayed in a Hampton in recent memory, so I was pleasantly surprised at my experience at this property. The rooms were large and clean and recently redone. Though the toiletries offered were not fancy, the rooms were nearly as nice as the Hilton Garden Inn chain at which I frequently stay. The free breakfast was adequate, and while I didn't use the pool or hot tub, they looked inviting. Give this property a try!","I you need to visit someone in St. Joseph's Hospital, or take advantage of the top rated Barrow Neurological Clinic, it's the only place to stay--for convenience' sake. The Hampton Inn Midtown (Downtown Area) is close to the Metro and to informal restaurants. . This location is nestled so well in the medical complex, you don't have to use your car unless you want to get downtown. I appreciated the fact that when I had to see a doctor I could easily walk to her or his office without worry about finding the location or setting out for a meal. Hampton Inn has complete breakfast offered, and the Muhammad Ali Hospital will in fact pick you up to make sure you get to the office you need. It meets all one's needs, especialky for someone new to Phoenix. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the night we arrived at Phoenix, and the night before leaving. The rooms were clean, but it seems like the structure itself is somewhat old, and we could hear the floor noise from the people in the room above, and bathroom noises. We also noticed that the toilet kept flushing by itself, and the bathroom sink drained very slowly. It did not bother us much, though. Breakfast was ready on time, and staff was friendly. Despite being next to a large hospital, it was rather quiet and we did not hear much outside noise although we slept with windows half open. We would definitely consider staying here again. I had a family member admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital right across the street (a huge convenience and reason for my choosing this hotel). The owners and staff members of this particular hotel are especially considerate of people like me: they have created a special rate for those of us who must have an extended stay, and they work with St. Joseph's Concierge Services to make the stay pleasant and reasonable. Weekend and weekdays vary in discounted amount. MUCH APPRECIATED. Every morning, I used the small but adequate gym facilities: elliptical, treadmill, and one other piece of equipment I can't remember. TV w/remote, towels and water available in the gym. This small but significant convenience helped me face the stresses of the day. Of course, the Hamptom always serves up a very nice breakfast spread. And at the end of the day, I could count on a wonderfully comfortable bed, clean bathroom/tub, and quiet floor (2nd floor) to unwind. Room w/ king bed big enough to do yoga (unlike other newer Hampton's where a king room is a tight fit--Alpine, TX, for example) I haven't stayed in a Hampton in recent memory, so I was pleasantly surprised at my experience at this property. The rooms were large and clean and recently redone. Though the toiletries offered were not fancy, the rooms were nearly as nice as the Hilton Garden Inn chain at which I frequently stay. The free breakfast was adequate, and while I didn't use the pool or hot tub, they looked inviting. Give this property a try! Stayed only one night because my convention hotel was full... but wished I'd not. Granted it was incredibly hot outside but I truly expected to check in and cool off. Ãheck in went fine. But when I got to the room on the 4 th floor it was 90 inside the room. When the ac was turned on full and the temperature went higher...I figured I had a broken air conditioner. Went back down to reception and was told it was probably just me because it was 110 outside and heat rises. Eventually got a different room on same floor with a functioning air conditioner. But the halls and elevator were hot hot hot. Room was not particularly clean but seemed old and worn out. Afraid to take my slippers off as the carpet was not clean. However I was exhausted and slept ok. Breakfast was nothing special ... Altogether, I don't think I'll be staying at Hampton inns anywhere if they're like this. The smell of the halls alone were a turn off. I stayed here based on previous TA reviews and responses from the GM and I was not let down. I was checked in by Mary Beth, who I had heard of in previous posts and she is just as wonderful as everyone else has said. Everything was fine, from check in to the room, location, breakfast, etc. In fact I had to laugh...in the middle of the night I woke up....thinking I was at home.....the room next door started playing loud music around 2am. I called the desk and twenty seconds late I could hear the phone ringing in the room next door! Not another noise from the the rest of the night!!! You guys are better then the cops in my home town, lol!!! Thank you for a lovely stay....will be back in a week to round off our vacation. It is apparent to me that the computer in the lobby/dining area needs to be upgraded. I went down here for the SME conference it was very close to the tramline which could take you just about anywhere you wanted to go. It was also very close to the hospital. Fresh cookies were always a nice treat in the lobby. It was not attached to the conference, but for $2.00 a day I didnât mind taking the tram. The room was always clean. The hotel appeared to have 100% occupancy because of the conference but service was great. The rooms were ok, a little out of date, but it looked as though the hotel was planning on making renovations soon. The bed was a little dated, but those will probably get changed with renovations. For dinner I ordered pizza from a nearby establishment, so they are close enough to restaurant for delivery. The breakfast was hot and was good, eggs, bacon. I would defiantly book this hotel for business again. We were traveling through Phoenix on the way to California and wanted a hotel that was nice, in a safe area, not overly expensive, close to I10 access and with a free morning breakfast so that we could get up early and jump on the road. After doing a little research this hotel seemed to fit the bill so we booked a two queen room. The rooms are plain with a large bathroom, both were very clean and everything worked. There were several places to eat within a few miles of the hotel and several museums. The pool area is small but perfect for a quick dip. The free morning breakfast was very, very good. It had everything from cereals to make your own waffles. This hotel was perfect for what we were looking for since we were just passing through. Another reviewer commented on the helicopters landing on the adjacent hospital and of the noise. Several helicopters did land while we were in the pool however that was the only time we actually noticed them. I did notice that we were the only family there with children at the time (5 yoa and a 10 yoa). During breakfast, I could see that this hotel's main clientele is business travelers and those which are visiting the hospital. If we were to be staying in Phoenix longer, then we probably would have gone with a different hotel since this one is a bit bland and almost feels like you need to be whispering so as not to disturb anyone. The staff was very personable and helpful. The room was well-appointed, very clean and the beds were super comfy! And, to top it off, the breakfast was very yummy; my kids enjoyed making their own waffles every morning:-) Then, we enjoyed a relaxing and quiet day around the pool & jacuzzi. Thanks, Hampton Inn staff!",,,
BASISPRADHAN82,653849,"I stayed for 2 days. It was a business trip but I also managed it as a vacation trip. 4 star property. Great location. Good number of restaurants and all of them are speciality ones. You will end up liking some restaurant. Must stay I will say. There are so many good hotels in Dubai that even though this is good it fades in comparison. I liked the bar ""dragon...."" But the location was a bit too awkward for me. Food was good , specifically the Indian choices. The pick and drop service was very average why I am saying that I don't know but thats true. I will say good value but personnaly go for Royal Ascot instead. Good hotel and you don't have to pay a whole lot of money. You walk out you find a small river and in the evenings take a round outside and across the street great open air eat outs and drinking places. Must visit them. breakfast and other buffet spreads are excellent. If you pay a little more you can get yourself an executive club room. Fantastic rooms they are and excellent added privileges as well. As anywhere in Singapore not too far from the air port or shopping malls. There are other hotels just next doors but this is a great one I must say. They have bus facility, taxis are lined up all through the day. I loved my stay there. I loved the beds.. excellent beds and room in general. Slightly away from city centre but never mind. Good cafes and eat out inside the hotel , dance shows as well .Service was not upto the mark but hey you would at times like to be left alone dont you? Lots of africans were staying when I was around. The hotel can provide taxis or can arrange for you. they can exchange money for you. Food was good with good choices. I nomally prefer royal ascot but this is slightly cheap to stay.","In spite being one of the oldest hotel in Bur Dubai area, it's still the finest , the location is simply the best, all major shopping areas, metro station, Gold souk well within walking distance, rooms are absolutely clean and so are the toilets, rooms are cleaned on daily basis and the toiletries are generously replenished , shoe polishing machine on each floor , the breakfast is Indian but simply awesome, in fact excellent , we stayed there for 7 days and everyday there was a different item, the restaurant staff were most courteous, speaking of staff, I would like to state that every single staff member of this hotel are most courteous, polite and ready to serve/help at any given time, my sincere Thanks to Mr Edward, the senior Receptionist who was not only most helpful in giving guidance but arranging our tours at a very short notice, letting us keep the room even after the check-out time, I had to send a local fax, he did it and when I asked how much, the reply was "" Oh come on Sir, it's on the house "" I mean there wont be many hotels which gives this kind of service , over all I had a wonderful experience, Ambassador exceeded my expectations We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and the best thing about this hotel is the location....its right next to the creek....near to everything you want...abra, bus terminal, metro terminal. It was very convenient for us to just walk a few steps and we get to the place we want. There is a department store (Carrefour) nearby. Its close to the heritage museum...good restos, old dubai (Diera), souqs. The room was very good, clean and up to the mark of a 3 star hotel. Room service was 24hrs....and good. The staff were very cordial and helpful. The breakfast was simple but good. The restaurant manager was very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is owned by an Indian national so expect Indian dishes. They did serve continental too. The WIFI is not free....but somehow we couldn't get connected to facebook. It also has a bar though we didn't use it... but judging from how it looks it must be good. Over all it was a pleasant experience for us. One of the oldest in Dubai. Its location is excellent as there are many shopping centres withing walking distance. Breakfast is good. Food is pretty palatable, that's if you are ordering Indian cuisine. Cleanliness and hygiene is excellent. Staff very helpful and friendly. There are so many good hotels in Dubai that even though this is good it fades in comparison. I liked the bar ""dragon...."" But the location was a bit too awkward for me. Food was good , specifically the Indian choices. The pick and drop service was very average why I am saying that I don't know but thats true. I will say good value but personnaly go for Royal Ascot instead. Was in this hotel for a day in October, 2005. Its location was great, close to the shopping malls and the Creek in Bur Dubai. It shares its swimming pool with another hotel next to it. The restaurant here was quite good. Though I didn't have any problem with the hotel, some of my colleagues were woken up at night with random door knocks... Hotel is a Three Star Hotel but Five Star Service... I was there in hotel for 5 nights from 13th to 18 december ... Every Employee of the hotel are very co-operative and helpful.... they make us feel comfortable and guide to explore dubai... We had arranged a tour package from hotel itself it included half day city tour, desert safari with dinner, and Dow Cruise with dinner... all were good. Rooms of the hotel are very nice and clean.. i had a room with a view to Khalifa... which shins like a star at night as the khalifa has flashing lights ON at night. Room was big enough for 2 people, it had bath tub and fridge, etc etc... Rooms were kept clean by the house keeping section, Every time we were out for lunch or tour our rooms were cleaned and give a nice feeling to enter in the room. We had a Breakfast included for Free which was also nice... Staff over there was nice to serve us nice breakfast they arrange a special request from you for your breakfast... Restaurant is now a days decorated with Christmas Trees and stuff, coz its christmas time now. Hotel is located in bur dubai and in middle of city which gives us a easy access to shopping mall and Taxi and Indian Restaurant etc. etc. Shopping Mall named ""Carrefour"" is very near to hotel which is good for shopping, I prefered food from Restaurant Name ""Karachi Darbar"" which is good food joint. Even Meena Bazaar is close to buy other stuff. Theres is Bus Stop near and we can easily get Taxi in seconds from the Entrance of the Hotel. Also you take a small boat which is also near hotel to go to Diera or Gold Souk they small boats charge 1 AED to travel to other side of the creek. Soo i would say hotel is in good location which gives access to all the things and good to travel. Soo it is the One of the best hotels if you have a budget tour for Dubai... We stayed in Hotel Ambassador for 5 days in December,2010.We were a family of 3 including our 18 months old son.When you have kids you need special arrangments related to their food ,mainly milk. We got excellant service from the hotel staff during our stay. They are very cooperative and all are Indians especially from Maharashtra,Marathi speaking. They helped us a lot in catering our child food habits. The location of the hotel is also very convenient and centrally located. We will strongly advice to stay in this hotel. Though it is not vey luxurious,it has all the essential amenities. Stayed in this Hotel and found it to be good value and close to the creek and Al Fahidi street so great for bargains. The wine list is limited but it is a muslim country. All the staff are freindly and helpful.",,,
Marino_c507,239080,"great surprise that this hotel, despite differing opinions on this site! 1 minute from queensway, live on the central line and 1 minute from Hyde Park, location! again, very frequent bus passes for oxford street (even on Sundays!) the hotel is beautiful, but I agree, this is not the best but very good anyway ... our room was very small ... but beautiful! flat screen, tea coffee making facility... and thick carpet! a real cozy spot with lovely curtains .. staff is a good and friendly specially Alex the porter ... you can keep your luggage all day when you leave the hotel at noon and take off at night! Great Value for money.. Highly recomonded Location was great. nice and comfertable rooms and staff also friendly and helpfull Four days in London lived really well, thanks to the location and availability. Linked very well thanks to the dense London Underground network. A quiet walk in the evening, with the final stage in the bar lounge in the hotel, fantastic. I recommend it for those who intent to live in London for a few days without a break. Four days in London lived really well, thanks to the location and availability.

The location was great and very convenient. The rooms were a bit small but I only went there to sleep as there is so much to see around. I wish I was there more than 2 nights.... I was treated very well from the staff. The room was very clean. I loved Spain in overall and there was not much to complain. Rather there was nothing to complain at all. I loved my stay for two nights at the hotel. There were lots of places to eat around the hotel. The breakfast place next door was awesome and you could walk out at 2am in the morning and still feel very safe around. Location was great and the atmosphere was awesome. I would definitely go and stay there again and again and again,,,
CinRoQ,232811,"The location was great since we loved to walk and were able to walk to the main squares that we wanted to while there. Customer service was also wonderful. I accidentally left my shoes under the bed and we had already checked out and were in the next city when we noticed. They held onto my shoes for 2 weeks while we were traveling through Southern Spain until we were back in Madrid. The only issue was a bar was located right beneath our window and we could hear the drunken patrons throughout the night, even though we were on the top floor. We were ""homeless"" after giving birth to our first child since we were moving from San Diego to Seattle. We had to stay the weekend in San Diego and choose the Marriott. They were able to give us a room towards the very end of the hallway so our newborn's cries wouldn't disturb very many people Very accommodating and friendly staff. Centrally located in San Diego where all our friends could meet us. We would definitely stay there again.

So what I am going to say here is a real updated one. The hotel located in a nice quiet area although it is not very far from the main arractions. The bathroom is big and clean, plenty of hot water whenever you want to take shower. It says free WI-FI everywhere in the hotel but since our room is in the corner at first first, hence the singal in the room was very weak. I need to go to the corridor or the lobby to get internet connection. But it didn't bother me at all as you don't sit in your room to explore the internet all day long while you are on holiday. Only 5-10 minutes walk to Royal Palace, My partner and I walked to Gran Via (the heart of city center)almost everyday. If you wanted to go to Plaza de Toros (Bullring arena) take the red metro from Opera to Ventos(its the easiest way you don't need to change). You will see the Plaza when you come out from the metro. We bought 10 trips mentro tickets at airport for Euro 18 for two. Actually we didn't finish it because we walked to everywhere. There is a club on the groudfloor. I was worried the noise when I read some reviews here. To be honest I didn't hear anything but my partner told me he couldn't sleep well only for one night because of the noise. But overall he is happy for his stay too. We would recommend this hotel for everyone because it is in good location, nice friendly staff, free WI-FI., big bathroom, etc etc. This hotel is located not far from the center - just few minutes from Royal palace and Calle Mayor. We had nice cathedral view from our 3rd floor. Bathroom is clean, room is not very big, but cosy. We had heard some noise from other rooms but it hadn't disturbed us. Wi-Fi is free and mini-bar is also free (while booking via hotel website) The price was reasonable, so we were satisfied with the hotel. We choose this hotel because of the location and we were quite pleased with it - walking distance to museums and very close to the Calle de la Cava Baja and good tapas - but the decor in the rooms were strangely quirky and it was quite loud The cafeteria on the first floor is not too bad though and the people who run it are very kind. Secure parking. HRC Hotel was a good value for a short stay in Madrid. The hotel staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and it was a short walk to the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, and the charming, tapas-bar-filled streets of the La Latina neighborhood. We heard weekend partyers' late-night singing a few times, but nothing too disruptive. For those with a car: there was parking available (for 20 Euro/day), but the garage entrance ramp and the parking space itself were so tiny we couldn't use it and ended up having to pay 28 Euro/day for the public garage a few blocks away. The location was great since we loved to walk and were able to walk to the main squares that we wanted to while there. Customer service was also wonderful. I accidentally left my shoes under the bed and we had already checked out and were in the next city when we noticed. They held onto my shoes for 2 weeks while we were traveling through Southern Spain until we were back in Madrid. The only issue was a bar was located right beneath our window and we could hear the drunken patrons throughout the night, even though we were on the top floor. A nice hotel to stay, friendly staff, nice hotels, but a bit away from nice locations. A tip: if you arrive at La Latina metro station, walk down the Toledo road, then Calatrava. It's a nicer and clearer trip than walking directly to the Hotel. Very good value for money. The hotel is in an interseting location if just a bit too far away from nearest Metro station. No problems at all and staff is friendly and helpful. Lovely cidreria next door is a good choice. Really good location, close to Plaza Mayor, Sol...We had a small room (501) but very clean and with a big balcony, excellent for sunbathing. Free Wifi and safe avaiable in the room.Allways friendly, helpfull staff. You can get to the hotel very easily from the airport by the undergrund for only 2 Euros. The area is full of tavernas and chilled tapas places. Don't miss the Sunday market in La Latina, which is only just a few streets away. Went to Madrid in May and stayed at Hotel Reyes Catolicos. We got there quite early and took the metro to the hotel. We had no clue where we were going. But once we found the Hotel we felt at ease. The friendly staff accommodated us in an instant. Juan Manuel who was the hotel receptionist throughout our stay there was absolutely amazing. It was our first trip to Madrid and he suggested great places to eat, walk and for nightlife. We found ourselves in great places around the city. The hotel itself was very clean. Thank god! The bathroom was very spacious. Although this hotel is not too modern it sufficed for what we needed. It had AC, a spacious bathroom, comfortable beds, clean linens, a plasma tv, mini refrigerator, a safe to keep your valuables. All in all if I ever go back I would stay there! There is a club conveniently located about 20 feet away from the entrance of the hotel. We stayed at the hotel for about 4 nights and out of all 4 nights only 1 night did we wake up to a bit of a ruckous outside. All in all the staff is super helpful, the rooms are clean, and we did not worry about our safety as whoever came to the hotel was supervised. Our rooms had views out over a vally, park and cathedral...all this just across the street from our hotel. In an area of flats and tiny tapas places only a few blocks from the tourist center of the city, and yet comfortably out of the tourist melee. Very clean, and helpful staff. At around $50Euros a night, this was great value. Good value,excellent location,very friendly and helpful staff. Snack bar excellent for cheap breakfast and drinks. Don't bring a large car if staying here,the underground car park is a squeeze ! Only drawback was that at end of April it was quite hot,and it seems A/C not turned on until May ! Made for some difficulty in sleeping initially.",,,
ben k,1194908,"We stayed here a while back and it was a pleasure. It is a large bedroom with a private bath in an older building. The unit has another small bedroom and both share a quaint kitchenette with a variety of healthy foods. The unit is clean, cozy and comfortable for one or two. It was affordable and located in a good spot. There were some great restaurants nearby and a laundromat. The hostess is multilingual, friendly and most gracious. It is a good spot if you want to be central and connect w/ a kind and friendly hostess/and host. They lives off site. There are stairs and I donât remember if there is an elevator. Happy Trails... Our trip to casa marina was amazing ..... it was my first time in the island and we had a blast . My boyfriend brought me to the best restaurants in the area. They are all so close to the hotel, so taking a taxi was no problem . The valet staff at the casa marina especially johnathan were awesome and always had a reccomendation of where to go and what to do .. thanks . There was a pool side bar where Nate, a very nice bartender, took great care of us !!!! .. our room was beautiful and always clean upon our return . also, we did the wave runners tour where Matt and Tom , our tour guides finished an amazing birthday weekend at casa marina with their energy and friendly personalities to be an unforgettable get away .. thanks to all the casa marina staff !!! we hope to come back soon .","We stayed here a while back and it was a pleasure.

We felt safe, were quite comfortable, and at ease knowing we had someone looking out for us while we stayed in Rome. You just don't find people as wonderful as she very often, so I absolutely recommend you stay here! Stayed at L'Altra Luna for a week in November. Being a solo traveler, feeling safe and comfortable can make or break my vacation. As I walked from the Termini train station I thought that perhaps I'd made a mistake in my choice to stay here. But as soon as I arrived at the apartment and met Flora my doubts were put to rest. She is so friendly, welcoming and helpful. I felt as if I had arrived at a long lost relatives home for a visit. I can't stress enough how wonderful it was to stay there and know that if I had any problem, anywhere during my trip that I could call Flora. I walked everywhere and took the Metro or 70 or 71 bus back at night. The stops are about a block away from the apt. I was never bothered by anyone when walking in the area alone at night.. The bed was very comfortable, I always woke refreshed. The bathroom was very nice and updated. Having the kitchenette was a plus, always appreciate when I can make a cup of coffee or have a cold drink at any hour. Be sure to go to Il Forno at Campo de Fiori for Pizza Bianca... watch them make the HUGE plain pizza bead and serve slabs of it hot from the oven....my mouth waters. I truly loved my stay at L'Altra Luna and wish that I could find a place just like it for every vacation destination ! We really loved staying at LâAltra Luna. Overlooking an inner courtyard in a typical older Roman apartment building, the flat is very clean, welcoming, and quiet. The room is large and comfortable, with no TV or Internet, which was great! Very nice bathroom. The table in the kitchen was laid each night for a good breakfast, with yogurt and milk in the fridge and coffee ready to be made. Assunta also brought in fresh fruit for us. The flat has a great location, very near the metro, tram, buses, and train station, and we walked to the Coliseum. However, if you are flying into Rome with suitcases, do ask Assunta to arrange for a shared taxi/shuttlebus from the airport. It was only 31 euro for both of us, and they take you right to the door. Itâs quite reliable, and we took it to the airport as well. The neighborhood is an interesting one of mixed ethnicities, with a large covered market (fruit, vegetables, fish, etc.) a block away, and a marvellous gelato placeâPalazzo del Freddoâtwo blocks away. The area felt very safe. Finally and especially, we had a great time talking with our hostess, Assunta. She has excellent English, was very helpful, and really enjoys meeting her guests. Sweet Assunta, she takes care of everything just like a mam let you feel like home; I spent 3 nights there, very convenient area to visit Roma, Very near from Termini, but if you are lazy to take walk to Termini, just take MRT at Vittorio E. :) We stayed for 3 nights in March, 2 consecutive and then one at the end of the trip. The area near the Termini station is not the prettiest, but it is very convenient if you are using public transportation. My suggestion when exiting Termini station is to go RIGHT and walk down about 4 blocks and then right again and over 2 blocks. We were travelling with quite a bit of luggage and we ended up going the wrong way too many times. We had no problems in the area and loved the convenience of the location. We walked to Termini to either pick up the Metro train or a bus to most all of the sites. The room was spotless and the Breakfast was delicious. Assunta - the owner, could not have been more helpful, although her sense of direction is not like ours in America. Just a short walk maybe a lot longer than we Americans are used to. Hoping on the #70 bus gets you to almost any tourist site (or close to) and most buses all head back to Termini.",,,
Justin M,919142,"We just spent a weekend at relais bosquet and it was fantastic. This is our second stay here and we chose it again because the staff are so incredibly helpful. It is convenient to metro stations and busses and a quick walk to the eiffel tower. We discovered rue cler around the corner and what a gem it is. Thank you once again to Christian and the other staff. The Mackenzie's We were looking for a good quality hotel, with a luxury interior and good location for our honeymoon. This hotel was exactly what we wanted. Staff were extremely friendly, superb location with everything within 10 mins walk. The room was very well equiped, bit querky with quality fittings. The breakfast was fine, not brillant but set us up for the day. 10/10 We had a 'Superior DeLuxe' room which was split level. SMALL rooms, high price, ancient commodities and indifferent staff.

The Mackenzie's Well for starters the staff was really nice. the rooms were clean. the location was good and the best part was it is right on the beach. the rooms with the view of the beach was really nice. this place also felt very secure. Only if your staying for the night would I come back here. Not satisfied with the 5 star rating AT ALL. The AC wouldn't work even after the repair guy came to fix it, the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, the windows weren't sound proof so we could hear every airplane. When we told them about the problems they upgraded us to the Business suite which had it's own set of problems, the ironing board was not working, the heat would come on randomly and the auto power down would happen every 1.5 hours until we got up and moved around. The service was inaddaquate as well, they called us and told us to wait 2 min till they called back to fix the problems...after 15min I came down stairs to have a little face to face with reception. Normally I easy going, but when your paying for a 5 star hotel you expect the basics and then some. Pro's: Rooms are ok Con's: Slow service, small rooms, poor bathrooms, poor heating/cooling HVAC system, far from Istanbul","SMALL rooms, high price, ancient commodities and indifferent staff. The only good thing is the location. Daughter and I stayed 3 nights, Nov. 2009 and found all quite suitable, comfortable and clean. We both have traveled extensively and would have no qualms about moving to another location if this did not meet expectations. GREAT location, Nice staff. The location is really good but with the same price (50 EUR) you can go to a better hotel in the area. I donÃÂ´t think is worth it more than 30 EUR. It was a total rip.off.",,,
AndrewtLondon,729474,"IN poor repair: the light didnt work and the guy just shrugged. They couldnt find my Expedia reservation and couldnt tell me whether they had taken a deposit. Breakfast is poor. The location is very good on Reforma. It was fairly cheap at 485 but I would have preferred to pay a bit more. The manager is pretty grumpy too I agreed with all the comments on Trip Advisor- it is a bit far for comfort but the 90 bus is really frequent and the 84 goes straight into the Historic Centre. We stayed there as everywhere else was full with John Paul pilgrims. The air con is a bit noisy, the walls are a bit thin and the drains smell a bit but the bed is huge and the TV too. Surprisingly the only TV channels are Italian plus one French news channel. On the plus side there are a string of fine restaurants a few metres away including the superlative Taverna dei Briaganti.","IN poor repair: the light didnt work and the guy just shrugged.

Upon checking in, i was immediately recognized as being an elite member a few times and my room requests were confirmed and was placed in a 9th floor room. Service at the front desk was very friendly and cordial. As others have alluded in previous reviews, the location of the hotel may not be the greatest. Its right off the freeway and pretty close to a residential area, and I'll agree that it doesn't appear to be in the best of neighborhoods.. But then again, usually neighborhoods near airports aren't the best. It's maybe 5 minutes from the airport, so that was a plus. In hindsight, maybe I should have booked something in downtown as I did enjoy wandering around downtown and Beale street more. Downtown and Beale St does have it's share of panhandlers though.. I had no problems with the room I was in and it was clean. The bed was comfortable and I had requested extra pillows. As reviewers have noted, you can tell its an aging property and it's probably time for a refresh of the rooms and hallways. The tube tv has got to go! I didn't dine at the property or order room service however I had a few drinks at the hotel bar and service was fine. It appeared the bar closed around midnight on a Sun night. All in all, the overall hotel experience was average, although everything was perfectly fine with the service. I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past few years, and overall it's fair to say that it's 'OK'. Any of the bedrooms I stayed in are pretty tired and shabby at this stage... but overall they are clean and the beds are comfortable. Staff are generally helpful and very friendly and welcoming. The food in the bar or restaurant isn't dependable (not even the simple stuff) and their draft beer taps rarely work properly (how difficult can it be to fix this?). Breakfast is OK if a little expensive, but serving stale lettuce and inedible croutons in a Caesar salad demonstrates a basic lack of effort in my opinion. Not investing in decorating or new TVs I can probably understand, but there can be no such excuse when it comes to food. We stayed at this hotel twice within a ten day period. The first time was nice, but the second required a room change due to a broken toilet. Also, that room could have used more cleaning, as exemplified by a dirty telephone. It is also a pity that there is a charge for internet. The hotel is located a few miles east of the airport, but no airport noice. It is not really near anything (pretty far from downtown Memphis or Germantown), so it's best to head there after dinner. I've stayed there several times and the staff are always pleasant and efficient. Rooms are nice (typical Marriott) with excellent beds. Decent workout facility, but running outside is probably not an options since the areas is a little suspect. Receive free buffet breakfast at check-in most recent visit, which was a nice touch. Parking on-site is free and ample. Front desk folks were wonderful. Room(10th floor) was very clean and so comfy! My only complaint was the Breakfast Buffet. Really not managed well. . Food quality and service here not at all in line with the quality of an otherwise excellent stay . Older Marriott that is in need of remodeling. Everything was clean but the wear and tear were showing in some places. The rooms were small but comfortable. The TV's in the room are older with below average reception. Service and staff were friendly and professional. The room was pretty, the location was alright, and parking was expensive, but easy. But when I left behind my wedding ring that morning, I was sure it would still be there. I was confident in calling them to go up to my room to grab it for me. They never called me back, I called later that afternoon, and they said they would get back to me, and never did. Lets just say I tried multiple times to contact someone and no one had the balls to tell me that my ring was gone. I understand I left my ring behind, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve taken fault for that. But to treat your customers with such disrespect and rudeness is such a terrible feeling. Can't someone from the hotel have the decency to speak to their hotel guest? The manager doesn't have the decency? Someone couldn't just call me back to say, ""We're sorry, we looked everywhere. We would love to have you back and show you how much we appreciate your patience and understanding."" This has been dragging on for 2 weeks now and still no one to actually speak to. The Marriot staff prolongs their problems until their guests hopefully forget about them. If someone from the hotel staff would have helped me the first time I called, this would be resolved by now. After experiencing rude customer service during earlier stays in Memphis at other hotels (including the downtown Marriott), I was a little leery about this visit. I stayed three nights and, without fail, treated professionally and always made to feel at home. It's rare to find staff so courteous across the board. So, hat's off to management. I particularly want to recognize DeLois. She is the epitome of customer service. The location is close to the airport but not in the best of areas. This made dining options either the hotel or a little bit of a drive in truly inclement weather. One other quibble: the televisions need updating. Come on, beautiful hotel, great staff and crappy tvs? All in all, great stay with a few quibbles. This place is really nice. The staff is very friendly and the grounds are stunning. The property entrance is filled with beautiful landscape, trees, and flowers. The lobby is also nice. The rooms are CLEAN, relaxing and inviting, with upgraded bed linens, fluffy pillows and towels, and comfortable beds. There are a few restaurants near the hotel. You definitely need a car as the location is not near any tourist sites, but freeways are pretty close and parking is free. Give this hotel a try you won't be disappointed.",,,
Kayla A,1818094,"IP Hostel, located on Warshauer StraÃe (near MTV Germany as well), is the wonderful hostel I stayed in recently in Berlin. It seems to be in the middle of the city (a bit to the right of the center) and it's a wonderful location as many train stops to tourist attractions are only three or four away. There were four types of transportation (I'm lying. There were five, but I never looked for a bike): Tram, S-Bahn (train), U-Bahn (subway), and Bus. It's a perfect place for backpackers and the young. The elderly may have issues (they had lots of bunk beds. I'm not sure if they had other things. It's possible). The utilities were great. The staff were all smiles. They spoke German, English (quite well), and I'm not sure what else. Ask them about anything. There are things to do in the lobby (a seating area to chat with friends, a pool table, a bar, computer terminals that you could use for a small fee, etc). About the rooms. There were bunk beds (I didn't know this until I got there. I'm afraid of the top bunk). I don't remember seeing a speck of dust. I believe that, during my stay, I forgot what dust was. Everything was so clean that I could possibly eat off of whatever. Prices. I got a room for less than 100â¬ (really!) for three nights. That includes the room, the keycard (for the room), breakfast (which was wonderful) and tax. What that doesn't include is the 2â¬ laundry fee. I'm definitely recommending this hostel to others. Oh! Bring your own towel and toiletries. It's no Hilton, but it's extremely clean, the people are always very nice, and it's cheap! We go to Branson pretty often and always try to stay here. I would definitely recommend it! I recently stayed in this hotel with a group of students from Texas A&M. The experience was great. Rooms were recently renovated, within walking distance from the convention center and easily accessible to the lightrail. The thing that made this stay the most enjoyable however was the staff. Walt was very awesome. He made sure we knew where we were going and set up transportation for us. Very very helpful and made the trip run smoothly! I highly recommend staying at the Super 8 if you are planning to visit downtown Phoenix!!","Definitely older hotel, but was a surprisingly nice place to stay. Was very quiet despite the fact it was full. Breakfast was good and the staff was very nice. Bed was a little hard, and the mattress pad on it was thin, but sheets were clean, plenty of towels, good water pressure, and the shower head was actually above my head! If you are looking for a cost effective vacation to Branson consider this place! Yes this is an older hotel, but it is clean. I have spent more and got alot less. Could use a little more choice for breakfast but that increases price, also a very nice lady keeps everything stocked. Easy location to get in and out of at any time, this is a plus in Branson. We have been going to Branson for at least 23 years (I say this because we have been Silver Dollar City season pass holders this long), and make two (5 day to 7 day) trips a year, spring for WorldFest and fall for Harvest Festival or Christmas. We have stayed at this Willow Tree Inn almost every time, through two name changes and two owners. We have on occasion gone to other motels, usually more expensive, and always made these one trip changes as Willow Tree has such great staff, clean rooms and a wonderful location for going to Silver Dollar City. The breakfast is acceptable and has been getting better the last several trips. If we want more, we usually go to ""Plantation"", about a 5 minute drive on Country 76. We are a party of 3 (all seniors) and get a room with two queen beds for the three of us and the charge (including taxes) has been a little under $250.00 for a 5 night stay for three adults in a clean, well maintained, quiet motel with friendly staff. This is a place you can count on for a great vacation without ""breaking the bank"" and is on the end of town by Silver Dollar City. We were there in late April and will be back in November!!! The location is good, clean rooms, adequate breakfast. Our room was a queen with one bed in the room which made the room seem larger. Lounge chair, two chairs with table too. The bed was a firm mattress and not with a pillow top as advertised on their website. The breakfast was adequate as advertised. The pool we did not use but it looked clean. If you want more luxury choose another hotel, but if you want value, clean, and adequate choose Willow Tree. We did not want to spend money on a luxury hotel, so that we had money to spend on entertainment. The place was quiet and we were in the tower building fourth floor. Appreciated the quiet, birds singing since they have a RV park and trees. Walking distance to Golden Corral or simply drive. It was very hot 90's and the fact this is an older cement block hotel the rooms stayed much cooler even when we did not use the air conditioner all day. Unimpressed by hotel, we travel quite a bit and with kids we are always looking for the best hotel that won't break the bank during vacation. One thing that was frustrating upon arrival is that we booked the family suite. Which has joining rooms, fridge and microwave for 6 of us only to show up and they had given the room to someone else even though we booked it 1 month ahead of time and held it with a credit card. The rooms are very outdated, this is the first and last time we will be staying here. $39 for a single queen bed with a last minute reservation (Saturday) on a holiday weekend. It was the last such room available; I got lucky on that one. Since it was recommended by another hotel I tried, but was full, I chanced it. Outside entrance, but very clean room, Old style bedspread, but other than that new looking and clean furnishings, carpet and fixtures. Breakfast was lacking--generic cereal, canned fruit cocktail, donuts, juice and coffee, but for what you save on the room rate, you can go to a restaurant if you want something more and still be ahead. We stayed on a Tuesday night in May. The room was large and the beds were comfortable and the folks working in the office we friendly. There is a Cracker Barrel around the corner and a Taco Bell right next door. The Titanic Museum is about a 5 minute drive away. The hotel is about a half block off Hwy 76 on the West side of town so it was quiet. I've read the other reviews and could only give this an average rating, but a good average. The friendliness of the staff and a clean room is their greatest feature. We had reservations and check in was quick. There are two sections, with the front being two-story, and the rear section three story. We did not see an elevator. Our room was on the second floor, a single queen. The room itself was clean, recently painted, with typical motel furnishings and a sofa. The bed could have used a new mattress. The outdoor lighting was so bright at night we could read in our room without turning on the lights. (Too much ""carpet-fresh"" scent) There was an outdoor pool, but it was not in use at the time of our stay. The breakfast host was very friendly, but the items were a disappointment from the previous reviews, with only cereal, bagels, and pastries from the fridge, juice or coffee to drink (no milk except for cereal-sign). It's a short walk to Golden Corral and McFarlands. The posted picture is an accurate view of the rooms. We were given a ""special rate"" for 3 nights at $99, but other motels were offering the same rate. It's at the far west end of the strip area, a block off the strip. Access could be a problem in heavy traffic. We would stay here again, but it would not be our first choice. We started our 2012 season with a trip to Branson in our 5th Wheel. We stayed at the Willow Tree for 4 nights and the place was just like always. The staff is real friendly and the Campground was clean. The price hadn't changed and the tornado hadn't touched the place. We'll be back again this year at least 2 more times. I found the motel setup with exterior room entry a bit off-putting, but the room was just fine. Everything seemed clean and there's a spacious room for the free breakfast: cereal, juice, toast, bagels, donuts, oatmeal and I think there was some fruit, too. The bathroom ceiling looked like it could use some repair, but didn't cause a problem. I probably wouldn't take the family here for a few days, but it fit the bill for me for a night. Located a few miles off the highway on a primary loop through town, just down the road from Shoji Tabuchi's theater. We had a very good stay twice this year. The Motel was a neat place for our friends to stay while we stayed at the Campground. The location of the complex is so great! We wouldn't stay anywhere else while we are in Branson. The price is a good value and everything is so well taken care of. We'll be back again in 2012. Thanks for a good vacation. We came with a group and rented 20 rooms. The rooms smelled great, were very clean, and nicely decorated. The owner bent over backwards to make sure we were happy. We arrived an hour and a half late and they were waiting up for us and even carried all of our bags right to each room. The little breakfast lady was as friendly and accomodating as could be. Don't let the cheap price fool you, this is the best buy in Branson. Friends recommended this hotel, and we were pleased with what we found. When we called to reserve our room, we felt warmly welcomed. This was the case upon arrival as well. This is an older hotel, but they take pride in keeping it clean and well maintained. We were pleasantly surprised at the price. It's no Hilton, but it's extremely clean, the people are always very nice, and it's cheap! We go to Branson pretty often and always try to stay here. I would definitely recommend it! My husband and I were told this motel was a nice place and they were right. We were very happy from the price to the clean rooms. We have stayed at many other motels in Branson and we always are looking for that one motel that has a low price but is still a nice place. We have found it. The new owners have done a lot of work around the property and it shows. They were very friendly and helped us find good restaurants and helped us get show tickets. Now we have the right motel to go to in Branson. As students we were on a budget planning our trip to Branson. After visiting silver dollar city we decided to spend the night in Branson instead of driving back to Oklahoma. The receptionist at the Willow Tree Inn was very friendly. Although the exterior appearance looks average, the room was very clean. The bathroom, carpet, bed and wash table seemed all new and clean. The only problem we had was regulating the heater. A small breakfast was included with toast, pasteries, coffee and orange juice being offered. As an experienced international backpacker and as students on a budget, we could not have asked for more. Good value for price! We were very happy with everything. Camping was great and the friends think their room was great. Prices and location was ideal. The service and cleanliness was great. We will be back 2 to 3 times a year. We have stayed at the Willow Tree 3 times this summer. Clean, good beds. Nice people",,,
SoaringDiva,2516094,"Location is on E Flamingo... walk up the street and you are at the busiest and most entertaining part of the strip. The suites were large, the most comfortable king size bed and linen. Fridge and coffee maker and sink with 2 person dining table. Lush gardens, exceptional service. Front check in and check out took maybe 5 - 7 minutes at max. Marilyns cafe steak and eggs breakfast from midnight to 5 am is excellent and costs only $4.00. This does not include coffee. Had coffee in our room. We arrived at mid day and got the last Kingsize bed on the second floor which was very comfortable. Very good budget hotel. Two most amazing things.... location, location, location Sunset Blvd W just W of Highland Ave. Within 2 minutes you are on Hollywood Blvd. The second was the front office staff. He gave us a tour map and since we had a car we did the tour bus route that took us through Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Rodeo Drive and onto the Santa Monica Pier. Excellent afternoon. Circq du Soleil is on the Santa Monica beach - did not attend. Watched the surfers, fishermen (crabs & Lobsters) and the buskers performerances. We drove back, parked at the hotel and walked Hollywood Blvd. and checked the stars. Sleazy and just like Niagara Falls Ont type entertainment. The second day he gave us printed google maps to go to Universal Studios - what a blast... a must see in LA. The King Kong 3D show was amazing. Spend some time at Universal's Citywalk and mall and at night we visited the Grauman Theatre. Impressive but not exciting. The next day we spent on a drive through Griffith Park and checked out the Observatory. Need at least 1/2 a day on this activity. We were closest to the Hollywood sign and it is very visible. The view from the Observatory is incredible. Spent the night roaming the streets of LA and souvenir shopping. The only negative about Rodeway Inn. It says continental breakfast.... 2 cereals, milk, juice, a cellowrapped muffins and donuts :( And too soon and our trip ended....

I think the room I stayed in was excellent, The room smelled nice, the bathroom was very clean and so was everything else in the room. The free breakfast is limited but delicious and always fully stocked, you have a free meal every day while here! The front desk staff really helped me out on sightseeing tours, local places in the area, and of course the Price is Right across the street. The area around the hotel at night is a little sketchy but otheriwse this was really a great stay for the price and location! Can't wait to go back and stay here.

It says continental breakfast.... 2 cereals, milk, juice, a cellowrapped muffins and donuts :( And too soon and our trip ended.... First of all, the location of this motel is great! Located on Sunset Blvd., it's just a short walk to the famous Hollywood Blvd. (Walk of Fame, Kodak Theatre,...). It's also a great starting point if you plan to visit Universal Studios Hollywood (just a 10 minute drive). The room has been renovated shortly before. It seemed to be clean at first, but later we recognized that there were ants in our room. Unfortunately we also had them in our suitcases afterwards. The nights were a little bit creepy, as you hear police cars all night long. I would avoid to leave the room after sunset. We stayed 4 nights there. Apart from the ""Ants problem"", the room was nice and worth the money, considering the big plus of this motel --> the great location! We had a very clean comfortable 3 night stay. No bed bugs at all! Our room was 1 king no smoking and it was as it is pictured on their site. We were in the middle of everything HOLLYWOOD. Our rental car was the perfect size for their guest parking, those with SUV's had a lot tighter spot. Continental breakfast was very good quality and the staff was very helpful and friendly. If you are a nit-picker stay elsewhere...if you want to stay with your favorite brother in his nicest room & save some money, I think you'll be very happy. Staff were very helpful, checkout time is 11am, yet my flight wasnt until 1030pm but they were more than happy to hold my luggage at no cost for most of the day. Rooms are big, bed very comfy only thing was lugging heavy suitcases up the stairs. Very close the Hollywood Boulevard which is why i chose it and most tour companies pick you up from the door step. would stay again no doubt, dont get too excited about the breakfast included, its not a sit down, its more grab and run, which suited me fine but not for everyone. Complimentry toiletries and a nice hand cream added bonus. Eateries around close walking distance, i arrived late around 8pm was getting dark, was solo so i didnt hang around outside too long had a dodgy feel but not enough that i was running looking over my shoulder, just kept my wits about me. Would stay here again, everything was clean, comfy and affordable, and staff more than helpful. Basic tea coffee facilities in room, fridge and microwave, air con. Does anyone know if they use mattress covers & what the bed bug situation is like? Are there any bugs in the room at all? Are the rooms clean? My son & I are planning a trip next month and just wanted to check b4 we went...Any comments would be appreciated. This hotel looks dodgy on the outside, but the rooms are really nice, and the desk staff is excellent. The man who was working there helped set us up on a tour, and told us which ones to take. They also let us leave our bags behind the front desk while we did some sightseeing and called a car to take us to the airport when we returned. The rooms were clean, and the pool was also really nice, but we didn't get to swim. Be careful outside at night, it's kind of sketchy. Stayed 4 nights, first night kept awake by nearby rooms partying until 5am - walking in and out along the balcony past our window, shouting and singing, banging doors. It was awful, although prob not the motel 's fault. Traffic noise is fairly horrendous but we hot used to that. Room was large, clean, good amenities (fridge, microwave and coffee maker) clean large bathroom with hot shower. Housekeeping was spotless every day. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast very basic and just in the small reception area, no tables. Free WiFi was great. And on our last day reception looked after our luggage until 5pm for no charge - great !! Too cold to swim but the small pool looked clean and inviting except that it is quite open to the street so no privacy. Walking distance to Hollywood Boulevard, easyaccess to great public transport right outside. If you are going to Los Angeles and are looking to stay within a good distance of the Walk of Fame, Capitol Records and the Kodak/Grauman Theatre; Stay here! The rooms are decorated wonderfully and it makes you feel like a star to stay here. Guy at the desk was very friendly! Deffinately staying here again! Stayed here for 3 nights in September 2010 before heading to Las Vegas. When we checked in, the man on reception was very rude and unhelpful, and offered no help in lugging our suitcases up the stairs to get to our room, which is the last thing you need after a 10 hour flight and being awake for 19 hours, so we were disappointed at first. However, the next day, it was a different man on reception who was very helpful and gave us a list of bars/restaurants to go to and he also had very good local knowledge and warned us of bad areas to avoid. The room was clean and spacious and the air-conditioning worked fine. The only thing I found strange was having the wash basins outside the bathroom in the bedroom part, but it wasn't a problem, just felt a little weird lol. This hotel is in a very good location, about a 5 minute walk to Hollywood Boulevard where you will find the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Mini-supermarkets, Souvenir shops, Hooters and other bars and restaurants. It is however, quite a distance from the main bars on Sunset Strip and you will need a taxi as we found out the first night. We started walking and after 45mins, still could see no bars, so we flagged down a taxi and it still took an extra 10mins by car. (be prepared, taxi's are not easily available). There was a small swimming pool, but it didn't look very well maintained and I wouldn't risk going for a swim, however, we did see a couple of people using it. I would recommend this hotel if you are only in LA for a short while. We flew in from BC, Canada and came from LAX to the Rodeway Inn! I was a little spectacle due to other review and seemingly low cost. (FYI we booked direct from their website and used our CAA (AAA) card for $10 off. Location was perfect as we too were going to a taping of Jimmy Kimmel (Slayer!!!) It was across from Hollywood High, just up from In-N-Out Burger and 7min walk to Hollywood Blvd. (El Capitan Theatre) Front staff was friendly and available Room was big and clean King Bed was comfy and huge WiFi was free and good signal Bathroom shower pressure was quite poor No Safe in room Pool was tiny and not clean although the birds loved it! Staff allowed us to park the next day in their lot from am to approx. 3pm without an issue. So if you are looking for a place to sleep, close to strip and all attractions with friendly staff then this will work. Cheap and couldn't be better located! stayed here april 14 1 night, excelent location, went to jimmy kimmel and is just a quick walk,not a bad part of town seemed safe! hollywood blvd just 5 minute walk.guy didnt seem to reindly when checking in, but freindly when leaving.all in all it was good value fror the $$ in that area cheaper then motel 6 just down the road and nicer rooms. ive stayed in both.and plenty of dining close to, also 7 eleven close!ill go back when i go again if $$$ is right! paid about $75 including tax!",,,
RayzeeNV,2515341,"This refurbished property is exactly what we need when we visit our daughter in West Seattle. The rooms are spare, clean, and modern. The price is great making this hotel a real value. The front desk help was responsive and gracious. The cleaning staff were good and honest (we left something behind). The management works hard to make sure you feel welcome and secure. This is the same neighborhood as my daughter's doctor, chiropractor and the new Trader Joe's. There is a hospital nearby so we heard a couple of sirens, but otherwise we had a good night's sleep and we were glad not to have to stay at an airporter hotel.

Seemed like a mixed bag. Was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the rooms. Mine was recently remodeled. Location was ideal, close to West Seattle nightlife, so no need to drive around and around... Close-in to town. If there is construction on west Seattle freeway, you may want to allow 60 minutes rather than the 15 during commute times. And the cost is about HALF what the big shots in downtown are charging. I will definitely stay again. Some more bars I want to check out in W Seattle. nice and clean...bed was a little hard, but we had a nice time. Overall we had a great stay. Plusses included the continental breakfast with muffins, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, juice, milk, coffee and tea, the pleasant staff, the housekeeping service and most of all, the value. We needed to stay in West Seattle, and this is the only hotel in the area. We had read some of old reviews and were a bit concerned, but we didn't need to worry. It has been recently redecorated. The furnishings are spartan, but it's got just about everything you need. Ours was a long stay, so my wife fussed they didn't have a dresser for storing flat clothes, but they say they are going to add those, soon. When we stay in Seattle, we usually stay in the North end to be close to family members, but I will consider coming back. It's not so close, but the value and the accomodations are much better. My friend and I needed a room to stay in West Seattle this was the only option and I was a little reluctant. We booked the room because it was in walking distance for a birthday party. The room was huge!!! We stayed in a king suite and itwas bigger than most1 bed apartments. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The heat is controlled with controls for baseboard heaters, that was difficult to control the temperature. We opened the window to try and cool the room down but struggled with some noise outside. The bathroom is large enough for 2 to be in comfortably. Kitchen area and living room huge. Nice pullout couch and flat panel tv. Coffee maker and microwave in kitchen area. The staff at checkin was great aNd the process was quick. The Inn has plenty of private parking. Overall, I would recommend for the price and location. Went in December to visit our daughter for Christmas. Much nicer than in the past. I love the new improvements. We did not have a problem with our heater our room was very warm infact we had to turn it down which made it perfect for us. Very clean and maid service was great.. I like the fact there is a Refrigerator and Coffee maker. I do wish they came with a small microwave. We just were their to sleep and that we did very well. Have been coming here for the last 2 years and I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements. I will be back for sure.. We've gone back to visit our daughter and family a couple more times during the cold winter months and I'm afraid I need to revise my rating. In early November, we turned the heater on upon arriving at about 10pm but after about 30 minutes without noticeable change, we called the front desk. Their comment was that ""it takes about an hour to warm up."" We did at least notice the register getting warmer so put our coats on the bed and, by the time we woke up, the room - which was a double - was warm. We were there again the next month - new grandbaby! - and wanted to try a King room. This time, as we were driving up at night from Oregon, when we were about an hour away we called and asked them to turn on the heat in our room. Which they did. The register was a little warm when we got into the room but the King room was much larger to heat and had a large window along one wall. We again put coats on the bed, the room never really warmed up and my husband says he's felt cold ever since. The rooms were still clean, the staff helpful and the rates very reasonable. HOWEVER, if you're there in the winter try staying in a smaller room and call ahead to get the heat turned on if you're arriving late. There should at least be blankets in the rooms. And why couldn't they turn the heat on at a minimal temperature for the rooms that are rented? This is still the only decent hotel in West Seattle, which is a great location to both the airport and downtown. Despite these experiences, we'll go back. I hope they'll continue to make improvements. me and my wife sayer hear over the weekend and felt that the room we were in may have been haunted. All through the night the phone rang off the hook. From 1to 4 am the morning the phone rang once, twice, and eightvtimes on one ocasion. I woke up thought my wife was in the bathroom, but looked over and she was still there. I called the front desk about the phone and the tenant told me just to unplug the phone. We really weren't scared, but me and my wife felt a presence that night. We would go back, because the apartments were clean and the front desk workers were helpful. Also I want to validate my experience in the future. The room this occurred was 132 . We did not have a lot of choices when we wanted to stay in West Seattle, so we chose the Grove. We made a reservation in advance and specifically asked for a quite room in the back wing away from Alaska Street. Instead, when we checked in at 5 PM on a Satruday night, they gave us room 201, right on hte corner of Alask and a side street. Arguably, the noisiest room there was. The rooms are nicely appointed, though the lack of a door between the sink area and the toilet/shower seemed a bit weird. Anyway, the bus noise was loud while it lasted, and quieted down about 10 PM. Traffic resumed about 7 AM, so don't expect to sleep in here in the upstairs corner bungalow. The breakfast area is small, nice and offers a fairly healthy choice of cold foods. The decor and room appointments are first class. I think I will drive furthur and stay at a quiter location--or at least one that honors our request for a quiet room.",,,
Sandy S,96608,"Completely met our expectations. Excellent food, well organized, friendly and professional staff. Will come back ASAP! My husband and I stayed at this resort Dec.18-22 2011. The check-in was long and wearisome. Our room was very nice and comfortable. The first night I was woken up numerous times by drunken rowdy people in the hall. We are in our 50's and not big party folks. The other nights were fine. I like the location & convenient shopping and restaurants. We would stay here again.

I like the location & convenient shopping and restaurants. We would stay here again. We were on a bus tour and stayed here from 11/14/11 to 11/17/11. When we arrived the room was sweltering hot and the refrigeratior was not on. There were 3 of us and had 2 towels (not towels that you could wrap around you). The management brought over 10 more towels. The next day when the maid came in she took all our towels and bath mat and didn't replace them. Plus my camera charger and extra was missing. For breakfast we had to walk across the driveway. They had oatmeal and grits in crockpots. An open jar of peanut butter and an open jar of jelly (no packets of either). The dry cereal was stale and the waffles were toaster waffles. All the bread was frozen and the biscuits were not done in the middle. When we asked for more towels they brought them and set them on the hall floor outside our door where everyone walks. The next day they sat them outside our door in a plastic bag. None of the people (44 of us) had maid service after that first day. There was another tour bus from another tour company and some of those people had bugs in their rooms. It was so bad that a representative from our tour company had to come. Our last day there they did have jelly packets but no peanut butter packets. Had we been on our own we would have checked out and gone to another place. Plus it is off the beaten path. You can not walk anywhere. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy. It is the pits. Oh, if you want to use their free internet you won't be able to get on because their signal is so weak.","this place is located in the middle of branson. its a little ways off the strip so there is not much traffic on the road in front. it has a nice swimming pool with a large hot tub. But the rooms are outdated. it looks like something that would have existed during 1989. It has a box tv. Too short of a shower. But a quite large bathroom. It is pretty much aplace to stay for one or 2 nights, but not a week. We were on a bus tour and stayed here from 11/14/11 to 11/17/11.

My wife and i have been staying at this hotel for about 20 years.We started staying there because its off the main roads but still has easy access tn all the entertainment. We also liked the original owners and staff.We would come to Branson about four times a year.Over the years we had some good times at mountain music. It was always like coming home everyone was so friendly.The hotel has changed hands over the years and went through some hard times. But we have allways had a good time and a wonderfull experience every time we have stayed at mounain music. In the last two years my wife and i have had some health problems and did not go to Branson.So when we were able to travel again i got on line to book a room and after seeing some of the comments i hesitated to book a room. My wife and i decided to take a chance and we were glad we did. The new owners were most gracious and did everything to please us. They are remodeling and sprucing up the place. The rooms were clean and i was asked if we needed a hair dryer,micrwave, or iceboox. I said I could us an icebox , and they brought one to our room in ten minutes.All in All our stay was five out of five starson everthing. We left good friends and hope to return again in the fall. My wife and i would recomend this hotel 100 % We enjoyed our stay at the Mountain Music Inn. The staff was helpful. The rooms were comfortable and we enjoyed the swimming pool. We will definitely go see the Christmas lights in Branson and stay at the Mountain Music Inn. A SUPER value. I just don't understand why there are so many negative comments about this hotel/motel.... During my stay i experienced great and friendly service. ALL employees were VERY helpful and went above and beyond their duties to accomadate my needs. My fiance and I took full advantage of the workout room and many other ammenities. Not to mention an amazing view of Branson's '76 Hwy. Located in a quiet atmosphere but walking distance to the Strip, I will definately stay here on my next visit!! We just celebrated our anniversary and I was more than a little afraid to visit this hotel after reading the reviews. However, our suite was very nice. The bed must have been a California King and it was very comfortable. The room was large, clean, and had no bad odors. The jacuzzi was clean, bathroom was clean and loved the idea of the extra vanity area outside the bathroom. We also had our own little refrigerator and there was a couch that folded out into a bed. The only complaint was the air. It was cold but, the room was so large it wasn't keeping up. We brought our fan along and by morning we were super cold. We would stay again and probably get the suite. Our daughter could sleep on the pull out couch. Holy Cow!! This place was terrible and very sketchy from the get go. We didn't like how far away it was from everything. There was NO ONE there when we pulled in. The guy at the desk was a REAL CREEP and had zero customer service skills. After he gave us 1 key, we had to go all the way over to a completely different looking building-very rickety as my husband said. When we pulled in, a complete stranger came over to us and asked if we had stayed there yet. We said no and he told us to check out that there was no air and the inside was nasty. We checked out the room- stinky and just creepy. When we decided to check out 30 minutes later, the guy at the desk ( with a stained shirt) gave me an attitude. So glad I left! DO NOT GO, I would rather camp on the ground!",,,
Elefant09,680057,"There was an exposition in Berlin ( I didn t attend it ) and the single room was 92 Euro ! That was much too expensive for a room that small ! It was cosy and had a nice wooden floor and I had one of the rooms with an alcove, which iwas nice. Eight under my room was the smoke area of the restaurant. It gets very, very noisy when people are ot there, so I wouldnt recoment that room in the summer . breakfast was so and so. The first day the salami was definitely on the old side Staff is friendly, there is no Lobby, Dustballs under the bed This hotel is very stylish , everything fits together It has the atmosphere of the glamorous hotels of former times with modern design. Ia was disappointed that our room did not have one of the alcoves, in the description it seemed that every room has one and I was looking forward to it. Our View was nonexistent with a parking garage blocking it. But that was the only bad thing. The room was very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished, although I prefer wood instead of carpet in a hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge booked us on a excellent boat trip(( Architectural tour) tour on short notice. They have a very nice restaurant which is not too formal but casual and very nice. They have great specials every night and there also, the staff is very nice ( including the cook who came out to ask if everything is fine ) I would definitely stay there again.

It is located at Alte SchÃ¶nhauser Strasse, a street packed with shops and restaurants. It is in walking distance of Alexanderplatz, Hackeschen HÃ¶fen and also Prenzlauer Berg may be reached in few minutes by foot. The value for money is unbeatable. For comparable hotels in this location you mostly have to pay double price. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is no reception in the hotel but the staff in the restaurant is also responsible for the hotel management and does a very good job. The rooms are basic and spotlessly clean. Event though they are located directly above the tube station, the noise is hardly hearable. Overall, Hotel Mitte Berlin is one of the most convincing city trip hotel ever visited. The hotel is located near Alexander Platz, a great starting point for all your sightseeing and shopping as well as a hub in public transport. I went to Berlin on a shopping spree and wanted to spend just one night at some hotel. And 1 night at Hotel Mitte was enough. I will not be a returning customer. It was just so very cold in my room and the bathroom stench was simply unbearable! The breakfast was very basic (it was nicely served, though). There's no proper reception and it's the waiter that checks you in. The advantages are: the price and multilingual staff (I heard Portuegese, Turkish and, ofc, German and English). We stayed here for 3 nights in early May.The rooms were basic, but clean, and the bathroom small but adequate.Breakfast was simple chese and ham with fresh bread and coffee. The best thing about it was the position which is in the heart of the Mitte district.It was very close to lots of bars and restaurants, all within easy walking distance. The metro is also just outside and is only one stop to Alexanderplatz",,,
frank m,269513,"This hotel is centrally located and the manager is cordial. Nothing else is commendable. The lobby is a closet like room which is not always staffed. Our room was clean but very small. The view unlike the pictures on the web site, was of scaffolding on the adjacent building almost within arms length. The breakfast room is small and food offering very limited. The T.V. did not work. We were not in Rome to watch T.V., but it should have functioned. We stayed at hotels and agriturismos from Milan to Venice to Florence to Rome and in between. Rome is teriffic. This Hotel was the only disappointment and not worth 180 euros per night, even at Rome prices. Members of our extended family have stayed here before, but it was our first time. The staff was wonderful, from front desk to maintenance. Rooms were clean. The property isn't as fancy or expensive as other resorts we have stayed in Daytona, but it was just as good. The only problem we had was the elevator had some trouble, but it was minor. Stayed one night with my son for a baseball tournament. Found the room very clean and the staff very nice. My son summed it up perfectly when he said ""It's not so fancy, but it's really clean"" The location was perfect, beach was great, pool was nice. The breakfast not so good, we ate the hotel next door. We stayed there for my wife's birthday Checked in to find that room we were given was already occupied but according to their system it wasn't. waited approx 45 mins for them to sort it out which then left us in a rush to get to the Opera on time. We were given a free drink at the bar from a predefined list while waiting. Bath in superior room was not suitable for adults. Breakfast was good but a bit short staffed, waited ages to order tea/coffee and then no tea spoons on table. Not a true 5 star experience","This hotel is very centrally located but not on a major street...so it's quiet. The rooms are small but adequate.

The staff was very nice, especially Patrizia, the day manager. They opened their breakfast room early so we could have coffee and a quick breakfast as we were leaving early on Wed. Patrizia made a deal for the cab and then walked us out to the curb when the cab arrived; at 7 a.m. The rooms are small, but clean. The bathroom is also small and there is only a hand-held shower hose in the tub. It is not possible to get a cup of tea or anything else there after the breakfast hour. The location, between the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain is great. This hotel does not have a lobby.",,,
rachyandy,234946,"this hotel wasn't the best, bedsheets weren't very clean, bathroom was dirty, shower was horrible, and the place needs a bit of work in general. on the positive side there was free breakfast, the location was good and it was easy to find. this hotel was fine for the money paid, rooms were clean, good location, easy to find from the metro. perfect for backpackers on a budget.","I Stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is very easy to find and only 2 min walking from the metro station. The rooms are very tiny and the lights are very weak, but it's very clean and the beds are very comfortable. Since it's in a corner, it can be a little noisy so bring ear plugs to sleep at night and you are all set. I can say that this hotel has a great value for the money and I would definitely recommend to other people. This hotel was very basic but clean and it's position makes it very easy to reach most of the sights you would wish to see in Berlin either on foot or by public transport. However this is the same reason that makes it very noisy - two tram lines meet virtually at the door, the train line is also very close and there is a Party Bar across the road. There is no airconditioning and the weather was very hot during our stay which meant we had the windows open throughout the night. Both the receptionists were most helpful when the TV needed adjustment and a hairdryer was requested. There are many eating places within close promixity which we enjoyed. This is an ok hotel if you are on a tight budget. We would probably choose a more comfortable hotel next time but in the same general area. this hotel was fine for the money paid, rooms were clean, good location, easy to find from the metro. perfect for backpackers on a budget. The room is just like the pictures on website but we were still a bit surprised how tight the space was. It is very basic room and adequately clean. The staff is friendly and they are not there 24 hours. There is a big parking lot in front of hotel. The location is very convenient for sightseeing in Berlin. It is quite noisy at night with Tram and Bar nearby. During the weekday when we stayed there, there was road construction going on since 7 am.",,,
Danny R,2515723,"Been to the Ramada quite a few times and have never had a negative response about it!!

This was the cheapest place I could find. It is close to the airport and after traveling for 16 hours from Amsterdam, The Netherlands that was a welcome relief. The staff was courteous and the rooms spotless. I remember the manager gave me a week pass to all the attractions in San Diego because some customer left them with her. The laundry machines in the back are powerful and cheaply priced. I stayed 10 days and it was a pleasure. The down town area is close by as is the gas lamp district. And there is a large grocery store nearby, I think it is called Ralph's. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

Please shut this hotel down. Bedbugs,an occasional rat,mold in the bathroom area, and a rude staff and manager. Illegal use of credit cards. No deposit back that was payed for when checking in and no refund when kicked out(accused of messy room and smell) with prepayed 2 weeks in advance. Disputing American Express Card charges. Contacted the BBB and the Health Department of San Diego. Look for more disturbing reviews on Yelp.com. prepaid a month before. Showed up and they were unapologicically full at 5PM wednesday 2/16/11. No apology. Guy at desk didn't care. No help in finding someplace else and not answering phone for 5 days during business hours when trying to arrange refund. The place looked cool. When they go out of business and someone who cares a little about the customer buys it, it may be worth looking into. STAY AWAY until the place goes out of business--and it will based on my experience. Terrible service. Very noisy. Drug activity is in the building. You would be a fool to stay there.

whatsinaname50,250933,"Where to start... We had one of our worst experiences staying in this hotel. The room we were assigned to was not at all like the pictures provided. Maybe some of the rooms in the hotel where renovated but certainly not the one we stayed in. Our room was dark, depressing and extremely outdated and old. The carpet was thread bare and the beds were rock hard. I have never slept on such a hard, unappealing bed in my life. The bathroom was also outdated and had noticeable mould between the mirror and the wall. We asked the front desk immediately to change or upgrade our room. On our initial day and each day after we were told that the hotel was full. My son was given a tiny cot to sleep on for 4 nights. He is 6 foot. There is no way that the room we were given would accommodate 4 adults....let alone 3. We found a sewing needle in the carpet by the bed that luckily no one in my family stepped on. We were given one bar of tiny soap for 3 people for 4 nights. When I inquired if we could have a second bar for the bath I was told that that is not their policy. One night a light in my sons sleeping/living area malfunctioned (it lit up the room every 2- 4 minutes). Upon calling the front desk at 1:00 am and then finally dressing and going down to the front desk at 3:00 am we finally had the desk clerk correct the situation (he put a chair on the table and unscrewed the light bulb.....never to replace it while we were there) We felt at times like we were imposing as we were ""timeshare"" guest. The breakfast consisted....daily...of stale cereal, dry cakes and fruit. On our last morning, upon check-out we were given a bill for 84.00 Euros for breakfast. Naturally I tried to argue but too no avail. I was led to believe that breakfast was included. They said simply to ""take our complaint to Royal Holiday"". I could never have imagined a worse experience than the one we encountered. Luckily Rome was both beautiful and fascinating. After our stay in Rome we travelled to Florence, Venice, Innsbruck, Munich and Frankfurt. At no time did we encounter such poor service, terrible and inadequate breakfast and deplorable accommodations We have nothing but praise for this little gem of a hotel. The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Our room was spacious and modern. The shower was a little tricky but we fiqured it out. Breakfast was adequate - maybe a little more attention could be directed towards a variation of the selections. Do not stay in Venice if you don't have to. Lido is quiet, relaxing and has a wonderful feel about it. Swim in the Adriatic Sea like the locals, eat in a outdoor cafe, watch street performers, and best of all indulge in gelato. Your Euro/dollar will go futher in Lido. First of all 5th Avenue is crazy!! That being said Hotel Lunata while on 5th is quiet, beautiful and extremely peaceful. The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating. We loved our room and our balcony - we stayed on the back facing the lush courtyard. Breakfast was good and satisfying. The breakfast area is a friendly gathering place and was perfect to meet the other guests and exchange stories and tips. Free internet was perfect for us since we did not have our computer with us - no time limit and no line-ups. We felt like we were staying in an oasis. We highly recommend this hotel. The beds are a little hard but we have slept on much harder in Mexico. Sun and fun makes sleeping easier.","Highly recommend this quiet, tastefully renovated hotel in side street just 5mins walk from main vaporetto stop on the Lido. Perfect if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice and recharge your batteries. Our room spotless with very comfortable beds and modern bathroom. All staff we met were polite, friendly and very helpful. Good buffet breakfast swiftly replenished by hardworking, smiling lady. Good choice of restaurants just a short walk around the corner. We particularly liked Trattoria Africa - good simple food and wine reasonably priced. I could not have asked for a more wonderful place to stay while in Venice. Tucked away on Lido, Villa Pannonia provides the perfect escape away from congested Venice. Upon my arrival my boyfriend and I were immediately upgraded, I couldn't tell you to what but regardless was thrilled. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, going so far as to help me figure out transportation to the airport at 1 in the morning the night before my departure. Living in Italy for 2 months now I have learned not to expect customer service, but Villa Pannonia has been the exception. The place was elegant, extremely clean, and provided a great breakfast. I would highly recommend this wonderful establishment where you have venice at the tip of your figure without the ridiculous over-pricing and obnoxious crowds. I am totally smitten with the Lido and Hotel Villa Pannonia in particular. We arrived in Venice 5 days prior to the Biennale where we would be sharing an apartment in the Dosodouro area close to Peggy Guggenheim and the Salute. The Lido was recommended for it's relaxed atmosphere and the Villa Pannonia as one of the best kept secrets. We couldn't agree more. It was a short walk from the vaporetti terminal and a seemingly world apart from the ""madness"" that is Venice. The Lido is wonderful. Bright, cheery, quiet and within walking distance of some of Venice's best restaurants sans the hordes tourists and sans the inflated prices. A great charmer and a great deal. We stayed here two nights on our honeymoon and loved it. Very clean and charming villa. Staff was very friendly and helpful. WiFi was a bit slow but not a big deal. Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. Easy water taxi ride to San Marco or wherever you need to go. We spent three wonderful days in Venice and hotel pannonia was wonderful to come back to in the early evening. Away from the crowds and yet plenty restaurants nearby. A pleasant ferry ride each day to the centre to sightsee, yet a peaceful retreat to return to. I would reccomend Lido as best place to stay in Venice and hotel wonderful. Staff so helpful and hotel clean and bright. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful. Venice is busy, crowded, and very happening. To sleep in a hotel *in* Venice would be challenging, I'm sure, not to mention expensive. Venice is more expensive than Florence. Also, the more tourist centric a city, the less hygiene is followed in hotels. Fact. Lido is a 20 minutes ferry ride away from Venice. The ferry stops a 5 to 10 minutes walk away from Hotel Pannonia. The hotel is lovely. Lido is quieter and cleaner, and also very lovely. The hotel rooms are very modern and clean with lots of space, the bathroom has a clean shower (no tub, hurrah! [do you want to lie in a tub a million strangers before you have shared?]) and nice soaps etc. Overall, the hotel is perfect. The staff was very very friendly and sweet to us. The breakfast was in a big room and full of people in the morning (evidently, despite seemingly quiet and exclusive, the hotel is quite popular). We were received at check-in by a very sweet lady and an adorable young man who were incredibly helpful with what to do in Venice, the ferry ride, etc. My only concern in hotels, no matter how perfect and charming, is hygiene. We were on a Europe trip and in every hotel we stayed in, the bedsheets had evidence of not being 100% clean. In Pannonia, there was small hair on the sheets. However, you can stay in a palace that is also a hotel, and you will encounter the same issue. Perhaps housekeeping in Europe is not paid or trained well? I recommend taking 1 bedsheet with you to lie / sleep on. We have nothing but praise for this little gem of a hotel. The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Our room was spacious and modern. The shower was a little tricky but we fiqured it out. Breakfast was adequate - maybe a little more attention could be directed towards a variation of the selections.

Swim in the Adriatic Sea like the locals, eat in a outdoor cafe, watch street performers, and best of all indulge in gelato. Your Euro/dollar will go futher in Lido. As my first time in Venice, I wasn't aware that Venice is formed by several islands, and that the main one, is the one that everybody knows. When I booked this hotel, I choose it mainly because it was one of the few that could accommodate my family of four in one room, and because it looked nice and had good reviews. Well, to my surprise, Lido is so beautiful, that we almost didn't want to go to the main island. We had a great time there, the hotel is charming, it is a remodeled summer house of a noble European family, it has a combination of old world charm with contemporary touches. We were given an ""attic"" room that was spacious and clean, the bathroom was not huge but ok, very nice gardens, breakfast was standard, and good service. Overall we had a very good experience. But the great thing is Lido itself. It has a nice beach, you can rent bikes and ride around town, lots of restaurants and cafes, beautiful gardens, this place is worth staying here, so you can ""visit"" Venice and go back to your hotel in Lido to rest and enjoy the scenery. All the people in the frontdesk are great, and the manager is a nice and helpful lady. The room is very comfortable, and the bathroom is spotless. Even the free shampoo is quite good. The lobby for breakfast is well-decorated, elegant and artistic. During our stay there was a gallery exhibition in the lobby, although we missed it but it should be quite nice. However, besides all the facilities, what was best was its crew, they couldn't be more helpful to us! I will definitely recommend this hotel. Yet it would have been even better if it had free internet connection within the hotel. Very quiet hotel on the Lido. All renovated. Our suite was spacious and bedding of very high quality. Little down side : the windows on the second floor are a bit high. Modern deco, lacking maybe a touch of color in room. Extremely helpful staff for any advice you may require. You feel welcome and comfortable at once. Very good breakfast (fresh orange juice would be great). A few minutes walk from Vaporetto (direct 15 min to San Marco or else 30 min ""cruise""). Hope to be back soon ! Stayed here for two nights with my wife and our 2 1/2 year old. The hotel had excellent service and very friendly staff. Rooms were very spacious and new, with a modern decor. The bathroom was new and nicely done. Overall it was very cosy. The only problem was that I could not have a shower standing (and I am only 184cm tall) since the bath tub was below the low end of the ceiling. Nevertheless, I recommend the hotel for stays in Venice. It is only a 15 minute boat ride from Piazza San Marco, and a great way to escape the confusion and crowds in Venice.",,,
travellingman1352,320192,"Best Nobel is located in a lane in old Istanbul it is easy walking distance to the sights and sounds of the old capital. Because of congestion our taxi driver dropped us off, or should I say threw us out? And gave us incomprehensible directions to the hotel. We got there about half an hour later in the rabbit warren of lanes. It turned out we were always near to it. Staff were quite pleasant and accodating but the hotel is a little tacky. We booked a non-smoking room but were first given a room which stank of smoke. They readilly changed us to another room in which the a/c was filthy and smelled up the room when turned on. We turned it off and opened the window. Our room was on the top floor but the elevator ended at the floor below. It was a struggle with the luggage. Breakfast was great every morning with a wide variety to choose from. Numerous restaurants and street cafes are everywhere around the hotel and tourists wander around the streets till the early morning hours. When we were leaving the hotel arranged a shuttle, for a fee, to the airport. This was a great help. Located on scenic, beautiful, expensive Lido island across the lagoon from Venice. Family run with pleasant, helpful, caring staff. We stayed for 6 days and had a good time.We had a comfortable, clean room. An adequate breakfast was provided each morning and even on the morning we checked out at 5 am. a staff member prepared and packaged breakfast specially for us and this without our even asking. If you are staying in the Venice area for more than 4 or 5 days buy the 7 day travel ticket which gives you unlimited travel in the Venice area both by water bus and omnibus. If eating out and you are on a budget eat in Venice for a fraction of the cost of eating on Lido. Our one disappointment with Villa Orio is that it does not have elevators and we were on the top floor and had heavy luggage. We would stay there again. We needed a one night lay over and read the varying reviews on this motel and decided to see for ourselves. From the outside the motel is not impressive. We booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room. On our request this was changed to a reasonably comfortable room. The room was clean and basic. There was no telephone in the room but it was equipped with a amicrowave and a small refrigerator. The sheets on the bed were clean but the fitted sheet was too small for the mattress and pulled away at the corners. The bathroom was clean but the drain in the bath was partially blocked and backed up. The towels were worn and scrappy looking. We had towels with us and used ours instead. We got a fair price on this motel and are not complaining. With a little more attention and effort it can be improved.","This hotel has certainly a good price-quality ratio. Far more inexpensive than many other comparable hotels, it is indeed a good place to spend a day or two. The hotel and the rooms are nicely decorated and clean, the bathroom well equipped. Breakfast is included and has some variety. The greatest benefit, however, is the very friendly personell. The sound isolation, what is very important for me, was stunningly good - we could sleep very well, although our room was just next to the breakfast room. Of course, in this price range, you cannot expect luxury. Among those small faults that are not really disturbing, but yet exististing, are the fact that the floor is of stone (or some similar material), which makes it quite cold (so don't forget to take your slippers!), that the heating is made through the airconditioning, that is quite noisy, and that the double bed is actually two beds bound together. But as I said, that was not really problem for me. The only thing that did bother me indeed was that the coffee in the breakfast room was really watered and tasted almost like tea! But there are bars next to the hotel, where you can have a good coffee, before you leave for Venice! I think this hotel is good value and would therefore recommend it for those who prefer to stay in Lido. Located on scenic, beautiful, expensive Lido island across the lagoon from Venice.

Great hospitality, large and in a classic style rooms, nice atmosphere and breakfast just back from a short stay with my husband and 4 year old son, staff spoke perfect English, were the most welcoming, loved kids. was a 10 minute bus ride away from lido, but bus stops right out side hotel, and go every 10 minutes which my son loved. only fault is the pillows are so thin. that the only fault i have with this hotel, as it was clean, lovely location, staff made us feel at home, i would recommend this hotel to anyone, and i for one will certainly be returning. many thanks to all the staff for making our stay so memorable. When we arrived at the Hotel we were greeted warmly by the reception staff and shown to our room, which was at the front of the hotel, it was very large with a large double bed, wardrobe, night tables and a small table with a couple of chairs the whole place was clean and of a high standard, the staff were very polite and the breakfast served in the breakfast room was well presented and much more than one would usually have in a hotel of this type and price. It is situated in a quiet area of Lido and was just what we wanted. We will be returning in April 2011. the hotel was in a lovely location close to beach and the bus was at your door .were you could go into lido town in 15 mins .there you could get the boat to Venice 61 or 52 would take you 44 or 50 mins.the hotel staff were great the rooms were cleaned ever day and breakfast was lovely.would go back. Fantastic, affordable place to stay in Venice with the incredible view and Ã¢â¬Ësafe haven placeÃ¢â¬â¢ to rest! I was there during the volcano eruption in 2010/april , the ladies keeping the hotel were more then supportive and helpful. I have spent there fantastic and relaxing time apart from travel panic that happened in Europe. The location is perfect even if you have to travel 30 min (with the vaporetto and a bus), but so much relaxing from the crowds in Venice.",,,
Peter O,259002,"We spent 5 nights at the Shangri La and had a room with with a fantastic view over the harbour and it was a delight to look out on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House each morning. Every person at the hotel made it a pleasure to stay there. The only let down was the meal in the Altitude restaurane on the 36th floor. It did not live up to expectations and the quality of both food and wine was not up to the price or setting. Despie this I would reccomend the Shangri La as a hotel to stay at. I really do not like the idea of writing a review but feel so strongly about this that I had to do so, I stayed for 3 nights on two occasions and had 3 rooms. Each one stunk. I have never had such poor dinner meals in my life and I had seven years in boarding school. With two exceptions the staff were offhanded and disinterested. I have never sent a meal back in my life but did so at this joint. The young trainee I think guy was great as was the boss, the girl and guy on the desk rude and the guy in the bar could not have given a hoot. I was in hospitality and suggest most of the staff did not want to be there or did not like the job. Avoid this place and stay in others of far better quality for the same price.","I really do not like the idea of writing a review but feel so strongly about this that I had to do so, I stayed for 3 nights on two occasions and had 3 rooms.

We stayed there for a friends wedding and just one night, so location was more important than mixed reviews on Tripadvisor - I wish we had listened to the poor reviews. The hotel is right next to a rather noisy street and a petrol station (we had a room with a view exactly to that). If not enough the room was to put it mildly ""dated"", the bathroom literally dismantled itself in the process of using it (toilet came loose, shower door came off). Staff tried to be helpful if to no avail, ordering a cab an hour before the wedding which should have arrived in 5min ended up with us nearly missing the ceremony. Breakfast (included) can only be described as mediocre (even Cuban state owned hotels offer more variety, quality and choice). And all that for a not so cheap rate to start with which can not be justified by its location (the only plus). Overall, must be the worst place we have ever stayed in (luckily not for very long). The Hotel Pacific was in a perfect area of the city for our needs. We stayed there prior to flying to Madrid for World Youth Day in August, 2011. With 80 pilgrims, the hotel staff could have understandably been less than helpful with our group. In fact,m the opposite was true. The staff was engaging with our teens and young adults and very helpful when it came to setting times for dinner, etc. Past reviews I had read of this hotel indicated a ""less than clean atmosphere,"" however we did not experience that at all. The rooms were clean and everything worked well. Many of the rooms have large balconies as well. The WiFi in the hotel was lacking, even with the codes that we received at the front desk. Really the only place the WiFi worked was in the lobby area. The staff in the dining area (contrary to other reviews) were wonderful to us. The self-serve breakfast was always a bit of a problem because we were usually out the door by 7am and that's when breakfast began. However, the staff was willing to open early for us and worked with our schedule well. There was mould on the ceiling above the shower, toilet seat was not cleaned properly. the staff were not always, but were sometimes friendly. I would recommend it but I think next time I will stay at a better hotel. This hotel is a walking distance from vaticano e have easy acess to many atractions in Rome. This aerea is very save, you can walk in the night. The breakfast was very good. I recommend and wanna come back. Service was adequate apart from the unpleasant lady manger who told me, rudely, that they don't have spare hairdryers 'as people keep stealing them'. The one in our room was broken. The hall porter sent to inspect it was well meaning but so slow. Eventually I was given the key to an empty room. Our bedroom was small and gloomy, the bathroom very small despite the website promising 'spacious bathrooms'. The whole place had an air of being rundown. Breakfast was uninteresting and the coffee - from a machine - was terrible. The bar staff were efficient and pleasant but the bar area as gloomy as the rest. Worst - outside is a very busy road and on either side of the hotel are petrol stations - thus very noisy into the night. Best - within walking distance of a metro station, but the Vatican is quite a plod away.",,,
BostonEsan,185466,"I luckily stumbled on this property through a last minute booking on TripAdvisor. I was flying in at 1am and I was looking for a clean, centrally located and affordable place to stay in Vancouver. Since this property did not have many reviews it was difficult for me to find it at number 50 in Vancouver. I hope this review will help bump up their ranking in Vancouver and give them some more exposure. They definitely deserve some more attention. If you are looking for a no frills, clean, centrally located and affordable place to stay with great service look no further. Nothing else in the city can compare. Thank you for a great nights sleep Kingston Hotel Bed and Breakfast! This was my second trip to Las Vegas and, this time, I got the hotel right! The level of service, decor, food and quality that the Mandarin Oriental delivers is second to none. Although, I enjoy the casinos, I don't enjoy living in them. This hotel smartly separates itself from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city and focuses on the two things it does best- service and luxury. I took advantage of the Zen City Package over my stay, which provided an excellent value. If there wasn't such a large quality of rooms to fill in Las Vegas the prices at this fine establishment would most likely be four times the price I paid. While you are there don't forget to get a drink in their bar on the top level overlooking the strip and enjoy their excellent restaurants! I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Quincy for a week while on a business trip to Singapore. I travel quite frequently and the Quincy is now one of my favorite hotels worldwide. I prefer to stay at modern boutique properties that don't follow the cookie cutter mold of large chain hotels. The Quincy is just that and they provide almost every amenity to make your stay the best you could possibly imagine. Here is a list of a few and they are ALL included in the room rate: -Complimentary Mercedes E class limousine transfer from the airport -A free and, I'll repeat, FREE minibar replenished daily -Free internet access throughout the hotel so you can do your work poolside on the 12th floor overlooking the city, in the restaurant on the first floor or outside on their patio! -2 pieces of laundry or dry cleaning for free per day, which is a huge plus because it is very expensive for hotels to do your laundry in Singapore -Three complimentary meals a day. That's right breakfast, lunch and dinner!! And the food is excellent. -An incredible open pool on the 12 floor overlooking the city and with a clear glass floor on one end looking 12 floors down! -A great gym with one piece of equipment that was so high tech I didn't know what to do with it ;) -and the list goes on and on and on The staff at the hotel also went out of their way to make sure that I had a fantastic stay. Everyone from the Hotel Manager to the Front Desk Staff was extremely friendly and I want to thank everyone for all of their help and smiles. You can count on me coming back to the Quincy the next time I am in Singapore and I've already referred you to all of my friends and colleagues. Thank you for an EXCELLENT stay! I recently had the pleasure of staying at Le Relais Lyonnais with my girlfriend over New Years. I can say without hesitation that the hospitality and quality of service that we received from the owner Albert and his son Michael was second to none. They made our vacation in Montreal a truly memorable experience and I don't know what we would have done without them. From the moment we were greeted by Albert's smiling face at check in until the moment we checked out to Micheal's warm goodbye we felt welcomed, comfortable, secure and very well looked after. This is the true benefit of staying at boutique properties such as this. You are not just another guest at a 100+ room property. You are welcomed like family and you can tell that the owners of this property love what they do. I don't know what we would have done without their numerous and excellent restaurant recommendations, as well as, Micheal's advice on where to go for New Years. The rooms are also very well appointed with beautiful hard wood floors, a very comfortable bed, a shower that I had to drag my girlfriend out of and an excellent location on Rue St. Denis. Funny enough, one of our favorite restaurants in Montreal is also run by Albert and is located directly under the hotel. Don't miss out on their breakfasts and crepes! I recommend the eggs ratatouille and the fresh chocolate croissants. Albert and Michael- Thank you for an excellent stay and if we ever go back to Montreal you can count on us staying with you!

Thank you for a great nights sleep Kingston Hotel Bed and Breakfast! We stayed at the Kingston Hotel 16 February. It was lovely, quiet, and the staff were very pleasant. It was aso a great deal and I can't figure why it wasn't chock-a-block full of people :) My only negative - and then it didn't turn out to be a problem - was that the bed was a little small. Enjoy!! I stayed here for 3 nights in a small single room. No frills, but very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms and showers were down the hall but I never had a problem finding a free one. They were all clean and well-equipped. I also had a sink in my room. The desk staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast room was also pleasant with plenty of tables and the breakfast guy was very nice. There's a little noise from the restaurant out back if your room is facing that direction (as mine was) but it quiets down early enough. This hotel is also walking distance to just about everywhere. I was quite satisfied and it was good value. I stayed at the Kingston Hotel, Vancouver, for three nights total that were divided around a conference which I attended in Whistler. Every employee of the hotel that I encountered was friendly and extremely helpful. As others have written, it does have a European boutique hotel feel, perhaps due to its size, decor, and design. Breakfast is quite simple as others have mentioned as well, but considering the highly reasonable nightly charge, it was, to me, expected. Convenience is a definite plus for this location. I flew from the East Coast of the US to Vancouver airport, and found the Skytrain straight forward and a convenient one half hour ride to downtown Vancouver. This hotel is a mere two short blocks from the downtown Vancouver train stop. What's more, when I traveled on to Whistler, the Pacific Coach bus stop was only about a fifteen minute easy walk away. The free included wi-fi was a plus which I used frequently, and there is also a free guest computer available as well. Personally, I had problems with the wi-fi connection on one night, but did not find it overly inconvenient to take my laptop computer to the breakfast room to continue my internet use on that particular evening. On the corner from the hotel is a supermarket, and there is a wide range of inexpensive eateries within a two block radius. The area is very safe also. Perhaps the only potential disadvantage for some may be the shared shower and bathroom. I did not find this to be a problem at all. During my entire stay the hotel was clean and neat. The shared shower and bath facilities were more than adequate, and are located on each floor of the hotel. They, too were kept clean and tidy. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Vancouver. I would definitely return again if the occasion arises (and hope it does). I was in a bit of a bind and needed a hotel for one night on a trip to Vancouver recenty. A local friend suggested this hotel, though did say, 'I hope you don't mind the bathroom being over the hallway'. It sounded a bit suspect, but I needed a room for the night, was on a bit of a budget and so I booked the room. What a surprise. On arrival I was impressed with the homely feel of the hotel. Very helpful and friendly reception staff. Up to my room on the second floor. Small, but completely adequate. Wash basin in the room, writing desk, comfy bed (king sized single bed? - smaller than a double). The bathroom and shower was literally across the hallway - and as other reviewers have said, don't be too put off by this. The bathrooms are very well maintained, and very clean. The whole property is spotless. A basic breakfast is included - toast, juice and coffee or cream cheese bagel, served in the small dining area adjacent to the reception. Very clean and comfy and well managed by attentive staff person. If you feel the need for a more substantial breakfast, you'll need to go for a wander. There is a pub and bar right next to this hotel, and I was a bit worried about the noise. I actually ate dinner in there and had a few beers and watched some rugby. Lively, friendly place. I commented about the possible noise when I came back to the hotel, and the reception guy said, 'if it's too loud let me know and I'll go and tell them to turn the music down'.He didn't need to, it wasn't an issue at all. You could walk up to the Granville Street train stop for the Canada Line and have easy access to and from the airport. Honestly, if you are on a bit of a budget and not fussed about the bathroom thing, and want to be located right in the middle of town, this would be a great pick. My wife and I just returned from a cruise to Alaska and spent a couple of days before and after the cruise at the Kingston Hotel Bed and Breakfast in Vancouver. The hotel is right in downtown Vancouver and only an $8.00 cab ride from the hotel to the cruise port. The hotel has a European feel. The stay at the hotel includes a continental breakfast. This hotel is one of the cleanest we have ever stayed in. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about shopping and attractions in the area. Granville Market is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. Next door to the hotel is the Kingston pub. The food there was very good and reasonably priced. We met people of all ages from around the world staying at this hotel. My wife & I stayed 3 nights in this well located, downtown hotel. We chose a room with ensuite facilities. We rate it highly, being perfectly located to many tourist localities. We found the room relatively small but clean and regularly serviced. The reception staff were friendly and well informed. We also liked the continental breakfast included in the tarriff. A great stay. Great central city location, within walking distance of many activities and things to do, clean and tidy but we stayed in August when it was quite hot and there was no air-con in rour oom - which didn't make for good sleep. There was also a lot of noise from the building next door from about 5-6am. Apart from that, a good stay. Spent a night at this downtown boutique (but budget) hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and clean room. Simple but adequate continental breakfast. No hotel parking, but available nearby at $20+ per night. Kind and helpful people. Real Bed & Breakfast: very simple breakfast, however plenty of other breakfast opportunities just around the corner. Good beds. Perfectly located in downtown Vancouver. My husband and I stayed here last night, the opening night of the Olympic ceremonies. What a prefect location! We were in walking distance to everything. As far as the Hotel goes, yes the room is small (very small), and yes you have to share a bathroom. But what do you expect for a inexpensive room downtown Vancouver? The place was clean, the bed was ok, the front desk people were nice and the lady in the ""breakfast"" room was very sweet. They serve you toast or bagel with oranges and coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice, included in your low price. If you want luxury, stay somewhere else, if you want a bed and breakfast in a great location, then stay at the Kingston. Oh, and by the way, the pub next door, The Kingston Pub, is superb. The food is great, and so is the ambiance and the staff. Two thumbs up!",,,
RickinShelby,2044020,"Long ago I stayed here once all alone for 2 weeks for business, and i fell in love with the place. Periodically I returned for 3-4 days at a time, and I continued to love the place. That was then. On my most recent stay at The Drake, I confirmed that it is as terrific as EVER! That said, some things about it are old and need a bit of work, but as a whole it remains a gret place to stay on the north end of Michigan Avenue. I have been visiting Hong Kong for 20 years for business. In this time I stayed at MANY different hotels. However, I have stayed here more often than any others for a good reason -- it is a fine hotel and a terrific location right next door to the Star Ferry. If you are in HK for a convention, this hotel is reasonably priced and a location hard to beat. Trust the reviews. If you demand a big hotel with all of the amenities, go elsewhere. If you want a pleasant hotel in the heart of the action but still a bit off the beaten path, The Talbott is a great choice. I am a bit negative toward large hotels -- so perhaps this was my mistake?! That said, I found this hotel miserable... and loud. If you like bad service, a terrible check-in experience, and rude staff... then this is the hotel for you! Also, bring your walking shoes.

I have stayed at this hotel 4 or 5 times in both rooms and suites in the standard floors and the executive floors. Frankly, if you can affored to stay on the executive floor, with it's segmented arrival area upstairs, it is quite nice as are these far more deluxe rooms/suites. However, the rooms on the standard floors are dark and dingy by contrast. Therefore, while my overall rating is a 3, the executive floors rate a solid 4 while the standard rooms alone rate a 2. That said, even on the executive floor up on top, the views of the harbour are a bit covered by the Intercontinental (former Regent, I think) next door. With all of that in mind, the location of this hotel is it's best feature -- the pedestrian walk goes right to the trainline making corder crossing to China easy, Likewise, it is close to the Star Ferry and all that TST offers. IMHO, this is the best hotel in Amsterdam. The experince is quintessential Amsterdam -- old private residences on a canal, original artwook in the rooms and lobbies, and a bit quirky. That said, the staff is terrific! On my most recent visit I was only in the city for 36 hours passing through Europe. The staff were extremely helpful to help me arrange my time wisely so I saw all I needed to see. This was my 2nd stay here, and I will be back again!","Stayed here a few years ago with my wife. Fantastic hotel in a wonderful location overlooking the waterfront. It is located in Kowloon - excellent choice of restaurants, bars and shopping at your doorstep. A fairly average stay.

Keep in mind that reservations does not equal reserved rooms. There was a family from Paris that had reserved their rooms there but ended up calling NYPD because the hotel decides to bail out last minute and say ""We're full"".

Great modern clean hotel right on Nathan Road; a block from Temple Street markets. Highly recommended, staff were very friendly and helpful. Stayed 2 nights in a King size room. Bed was US sized King size and much bigger than UK size. Room was clean and spacious with TFT TV on wall. 2 chairs to sit on round small coffee table and additional computer chair in front of workspace. Hotel staff very pleasant and friendly, and made the stay that much nicer. Will always be my first choice when staying in Amsterdam. Stayed as part of an Archers Direct/Cosmos holiday this has to be the dirtiest hotel we've ever stayed in. The filthy stained reception carpet should have alerted us as to what was to come. Our ""clean"" room had urine on the toilet, the minibar had hairs in it, and the bedding covered in dubious stains. Our replacement room wasn't much cleaner but it was all that was avaialble. Definately not recommended. We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on a short break to Madrid. The hotel itself is in a good location, but that's about the only good point we can describe. We had room 504 which smelt like something had died in there. There was a constant smell of rotten cabbage and sewage in the room. In order to survive we had to open the window, but it was absolutely impossible to sleep because of the noise. Even if we did close the window, there was screaming and shouting all night, and all night deliveries (banging, clashing). We barely got any sleep for the entire 2 nights, and it completely ruined our holiday. The walls in the room were paper thin and even had holes in them, we could hear the people next door talking. The room supposedly had free WiFi, but we couldn't get any signal in the room. We had to go into the hallway or reception to get a signal. The hotel was under renovation, and there were better rooms. However, the staff said they couldn't move us to another room as the hotel was full. The staff aren't very friendly (apart from the guy on the night-shift). The breakfast was awful, they only had a small collection of bread, ham and cheese. The coffee was undrinkable (Extremely strong cheap coffee). I know this is a 2* hotel, but it is by far the worst 2* hotel we've ever stayed in. I highly recommend you DO NOT stay in this hotel. Apart from the excellent location, there is nothing good I can write about it. My name is Tony W, I took my two kids on a Fla vacation last week and we decided to stay at this Hotel. what a bad idea that was. when I went to check in they couldn't find my reservation,so they put me in a different room than I wanted. I reserved a King room that looked very nice from the pictures on line but I ended up with just a plain room,very small . but I was charged the rate for the king room. after three of our six day stay they moved us to a different room but still not the king room. the wifi didn't work in the lobby, the pool had a salt water filter system on it so the pool was nasty and in the six days we stayed it was not cleaned once. the people at the front desk was rude to everyone they spoke to. this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. we go to Fla every year and this was the first time and the last time I will ever stay here. when I went to check out they told me that there whole system was down and I would need to wait four hours to check out, I could not wait that long so I choose to leave, when I ask them to mail my invoice to me they said that they could not do that. and as of yet I don't know when I will get credit for my $50.00 deposit that I was charged above the room rate. the pictures on there web site are out dated this hotel is in very bad condition, my advice to all would be to pass this place up and find some other place to stay. A truly wonderful hotel with warm and welcoming staff who could not do enough for you. We stayed here in early September in a beautiful suite on the top floor. As this was part of our tour of Spanish cities, we had been very careful in our choice of hotels, yet this hotel was still the best we stayed in by some distance. If you are looking for a small 5* + hotel this is the place to go in Madrid. We shall return! If only for the excellent chilled glass of champagne on arrival Suite was to have balcony, dining table and chairs, upgraded bathroom amenities including Roman tub and bathrobes, mini-bar. Balcony had absolutely no furniture (no chair, no table, nothing). Bathroom had no tub, there were no bathrobes. There were no drinking glasses in the bathroom, no wash cloths. There was no mini-bar or refrigerator. The suite did not have a dining table. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, but I probably would have had the same bed in a standard room. Having reserved a suite, which was supposed to be the best room available at this hotel, I expected more. My family and i stayed at the The Sea Breeze form April 18th to the 21st. The staff there is great. They took care of all of us as my parents and my brother and his family where all on vacation. It rained one afternoon and the staff gave the kids towels because they saw how cold they where. All of them where very very nice people. The rooms where cozy and the porperty was nice and clean. We had rooms with and ocean view and balcony and it was just perfect. Also i left my watch in the room after we checked out and someone in housekeepinfg returned it to the front desk, and they called my sister in law and are going to ship the watch back to us. Thanks to however returned my watch that person is truly a very genuinely honest person. Thats how the Sea Breeze is though, a wonderful place. We had a great time in Vancouver and staying at the hotel just made it all the better.The door men were very friendly and helpfull the Restaurant was great plenty of food and great service.The room was good just a problem with the toilet now and then.But other wise the view from our room was perfect..All the staff should be very pleased with them selves.Hope to visit again very soon.Hi to Dan&Stewart.Regards Tony&Kim.Newcastle Australia.","I stayed in this hotel for two weeks in October. It was a work travel. The rooms are very clean, all new, although some details need to be finished (in my room the fake ceiling was not finished and I was able to see in the attic). The personnel of the hotel was available and gave me good advises for the restaurants in the area. Near the hotel, there are bus stops for the train station Termini and for the center. Although, the breakfast is very poor and the internet is very expensive. Stayed as part of an Archers Direct/Cosmos holiday this has to be the dirtiest hotel we've ever stayed in. The filthy stained reception carpet should have alerted us as to what was to come. Our ""clean"" room had urine on the toilet, the minibar had hairs in it, and the bedding covered in dubious stains. Our replacement room wasn't much cleaner but it was all that was avaialble. Definately not recommended. The hotel staff was very unhelpful and especially the manager at the reception. He was uncooperative and did not care about the guests. The only nice and kind person was the luggage handler who had to carry all the suitcases in a tiny lift. We carried our own suitcases to our room as he was struggling with a full coach load of bags and suitcases. Wifi was charged at 5 Euro per hour and when we asked to get only 30 minutes, the manager answered that the hotel wasn't offering the option. We found this attitude very upsetting, especially in the heart of Europe and with the prices being charged for the rooms! Breakfast was of mediocre quality and one lady kept watching clients helping themselves to the food, just in case they were taking a piece of bread or a bun with them to eat later. She kept staring at clients and at the food on their tables obsessively. This attitude was extremely annoying as they did not seem to care about customersâ satisfaction but more about the quantity of the poor quality food being eaten or taken away. Personally, I would recommend to avoid this hotel until the managment understands that guests should be treated nicely and changes its attitude. hotel room very small but that came to be expected the longer I was in europe, the hotel is in a nice area but far removed from most attractions in rome, breakfast was ok but eggs were not real eggs, service was just ok, elevator and shower is very very small.... The hotel is completely off the beaten track but with good public transport connections (buses) to the central train station. A taxi to/from the airport (Fiumicino) takes over an hour, if there is no traffic. I had a meeting nearby, so the location was perfect for me. The room was clean and adequately decorated for the hotel class. At the front desk I bought a voucher for 1 hour of WiFi access but when I tried to connect in my room, the connection speed was too slow to download even smallest emails. I complained and got a refund without any hassle. The breakfast was a bit of strange experience â I walked into a small, crowded breakfast room where only coffee, rolls, butter, and jelly were on offer. I was somewhat disappointed but soon discovered that I was in the breakfast room for groups! In the adjacent room, behind a frosted glass door, a very decent breakfast was on offer to individual guests. I moved there and once a server verified that I was in fact an individual guest I was able to enjoy a nice continental breakfast.",,,
Melissa C,549494,"We stayed at the Omni San Francisco in September for our honeymoon and it was fantastic!! We upgraded to the Omni Select which allowed for daily morning beverage selection delivered to the room which was a great way to start the day! It also allowed for WiFi access in the room. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. All staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, helped us find great places to eat and even booked our trip to Alcatraz for us! Location is unbeatable!! Public transportation is accessible from right in front of the hotel or within a block away. We would not hesitate to recommended this hotel to anyone! We plan on staying here when we return to San Francisco! Our organization just got back from another fantastic conference at the Town and Country. What makes this property different, besides how lush and welcoming the outdoor areas are, is the people who work here. Mark Yunker, our convention services manager, was fantastic. But, so was every staff member we encountered. From management, to housekeeping, to the whistling gardeners we would come across in the morning. Though it is hard to be away from home for two weeks, the Town and Country helped to make us feel like part of their family. This was our scariest hotel experience during our two weeks in the UK. After climbing the steep stairs to our room, we discovered the locks don't actually fully engage. In fact, we were able to enter with a credit card (no, we are not thieves). After that, we were informed that our toilet was up another flight of stairs. We decided to forgo the shower, as it did not appear too clean. We were thankful for the fan that was in the room, we assume that was because all the heaters in the building were cranked on high. There were no amenities to speak of and we missed breakfast to make our train, but truthfully we were a little frightened of what it might be like. There was a sign saying you needed to wait for personnel to check you out of your room. After waiting 15 minutes, we found all we had to do was hand him the key. Thanks for helping us almost miss our train. Overall, we would not recommend this hotel. Although it is just around the corner from the train station, it was not worth the financial savings.

We stayed this past week for 5 days, and loved every minute! We are in our 30's and live in NYC and love to travel, and we were pleasantly surprised. The resort has an old world southern charm about it as soon as you pull up to the driveway. The grounds, main building, golf course, restaurants and rooms are all very clean and well kept. The staff was beyond pleasant, Especially Matt, the Grill Manager! Even the bartenders loved to give us suggestions on other restaurants and vineyards to visit! Our room was the basic king sized guest room, and it was updated and very nice. After a long day of wine tasting, we always met at the grill bar to relax during wine happy hour. Some people will complain about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING! The staff at this resort seem to genuinely care about their guests having a great experience. We are already planning a trip back to Silverado with a group of friends this coming August! I travel frequently for work and the service at this hotel is exceptional. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are awesome! The server/bartender was very enthusiastic, friendly, knowledgeable, and provided me and the others I observed with stellar service. It was nice to have this kind of service after a long day of work and travel. We stayed at the Omni San Francisco in September for our honeymoon and it was fantastic!!

We plan on staying here when we return to San Francisco! We stayed here for two days in June and it was just absolutely wonderful. The front desk employees were so curteous and nice. The view was beautiful and it was so lovely to sit out on the hotel porch as the sun set. I love that they're right on the boardwalk and have a bar and restraunt right in the hotel. Everything was perfect for our weekend away and I will definately be coming back again. the website said it had internet, they did not. when asked, the counterperson's response was curt. he said that there was a hotel down the way that did have it - just 2 minutes walking. it's far and remote. our room looked nothing like the photos. it looked more like an old dorm room. there is nothing special about this location that would make you want to go out of your way to stay here. i've never written one of these before but feel so negatively about the place that i wanted to warn other travelers. stay away.

The nice thing in Maui is that all beaches are public. Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is located just down from Black Rock on one side and Whalers Village on the other. Older hotel, with tiny shower and horribly uncomfortable bed. However, the location right on the beach was AMAZING! Affordable beach chairs/umbrella was also available. I had a opportunity to come to New Orleans in December and stayed at the Roosevelt hotel which is by far the most beautiful holiday celebration in the city! The lobby spans the whole block and from end to end you walk through a winter wonderland. It's very magical and festive full of families taking pictures and couples dressed for a special occaision. It's a must see even if you aren't staying in the hotel. The rooms are large and elegant, with extreamly comfortable beds. I had a seperate sitting area in the room so you didn't feel crowded. The hospitality of the staff was sincere and welcoming. Everything was high end down to the Ferragamo toiletries. The rooms were very quiet and dark allowing you to sleep in if you have too much fun in the French Quarter the night before! The hotel is on the edge of the business district walking distance to the French Quarter but just outside the fray of the Quarter. Its about 3 blocks from the street car so getting to the Garden District is very easy. The Roosevelt is a wonderful hotel, I would stay here again, no question! My husband I stayed at the Hazelton Hotel while we were in town visiting our friends. What was supposed to be a quick stay for us, it ended up being a stay to remember. The food from the One resturant was amazing. We were able to enjoy both breakfast and dinner in the resturant. Towards the end of dinner, the bar was getting very loud but it was a good way for us to end the night with our friends. The room was not a typical standard size room. My husband and I were able to both fit in the deep bath tub! The service that we recieved from the hotel was second to none. From the moment we were greeted at the door to the moment we left, the service was immpecable. We look foward to our return in a few months. We have recently returned fro a 7 night leisure stay at the rio and had a great time! We were very dubious about staying here after reading reviews but were pleasantly surprised. We arrived on a thurs afternoon and checked in within 15 min. The only problem was we requested a smoking room which none were available but we were told we could swap to the following day but declined as we were then settled in our room. We stayed in the masquerade tower rooms were very big and as requested we got a good strip view. Very clean and towels replaced daily. Staff extremely friendly and by far the fastest casino drink service we experienced in Vegas so did the majority of our gambling here. We used the shuttles and never waited more than 15 min for a bus. 24 hour buffet pass also good value. Pool area also very nice but one pool out of use but assumed that was due to number of guests. Efficient pool drink service too. Would stay here again very ample 3 star accommodation.","the website said it had internet, they did not. when asked, the counterperson's response was curt. he said that there was a hotel down the way that did have it - just 2 minutes walking. it's far and remote. our room looked nothing like the photos. it looked more like an old dorm room. there is nothing special about this location that would make you want to go out of your way to stay here. i've never written one of these before but feel so negatively about the place that i wanted to warn other travelers. stay away. It is honestly a very nice hotel. The room was very clean and cosy, I really enjoyed getting some rest in there. The breakfast buffet was very nice and enough for a good day start. On the floor we stayed there was also a automatic machine for drinks you could buy - really comfortable. The hotel was however a little far from the city center. On the one hand I was very lucky that i was there with a group, so we had a bus transfering us all around. On the other hand, I wish I were there only with my friends (and a personal vehicle), so that I could come in a more direct contact with the hotel personnel. Do not stay here!!! It is not as advertised. Not well lit in the parking lot. Absolutely no security! Staff not very friendly. Our car was broken into in the parking lot of the hotel and they were not helpful at all. Wouldn't even call the police for us. The night before when we had come home in from dinner there were people just hanging around on the steps of the hotel (gang like) just outside our room. Like I said no security! I doubt they even had rooms there. Not to mention the rooms are tiny and hardly clean at all. Dirty room - definitely not a 3 star hotel, terrible location, pedestrian access to bus stop into town requires you to walk along a stretch of dual carriageway (and of course there's nowhere to buy tickets). We couldn't bring ourselves to stay, so cancelled on the spot and ended up in a fantastic hotel in the city centre.",,,
steveafa,529094,"This hotel is very close to the main railway station but that is the only plus we had. Our stay was very short because I had to find another hotel for our weekend trip in Amsterdam. Upon our arrival the room was on the top floor 4th where the heating was off. Took us almost 5 hours to heat up the room a bit othewise we sould be sleeping in pulovers. Internet was not working, guys on the desk were not even a bit helpful. Elevator was going only to the 3rd floor for some reason broke down and we had to carry the luggadge by to the 4th floor in a very steep and narrow corridor. Rooms on the pictures look nice actually i got the room that was on the web page but i can promise you it is very bad when you see it .... This hotel is located in nice place antique rome called Lido di Ostia. Place is famous for the beach and sea food. Regarding this hotel please avoid it if you can. Rooms are okay but the quality and price is very bad. You pay too much for a hotel that would meet my expectations of a 2 star hotel not a 4 star hotel. Internet is too expensive with a swisscom provider. Food in the restaurant is okay but do not waste your time and go outside just next to the hotel you can find some great sea food restaurants which are great. This hotel is very close to the central station with a bus stop next to it for those who buy amsterdam pass great place to start those trips. People in the hotel are very friendly and really helpful. I had to switch hotel because the one we stayed before was really bad - Hotel Sint Nicolaas Amsterdam. Avoid this hotel. Internet in Center Hotel Amsterdam is for free and speed is okay. As I have mentioned the location is great to start your trips in Amsterdam. Me and my girlfriend we have really enjoyed the stay there and I can recommend the hotel even though it was not cheap.","This hotel is very close to the central station with a bus stop next to it for those who buy amsterdam pass great place to start those trips.

Titania2000,2406995,Good bed and shower excellent pillows. Free Wi Fi Large for the room air conditioner's output was directed onto the bed. Room was extremely small.. Was quoted $254.88 for two nights got charged $300. The bed was walled in on tree sides. I will have a good look around to see what else is available at the price at the next visit Easy walking to most of Madrid's attractions. The smallest lift I have ever seen in a hotel does not stop at street level. So suitcases have to be carted up and down stairs. Room was clean bed ok. Shower in bathtub. Staff friendly and helpful. Had some medicine that needed to be kept cool It was looked after by the staff as there was no fridge in the room.Toilet proved to be fragile and required a couple of service calls. Breakfast was very good with a lot of choices.,"Santa Grand Hotel - Lai Chun Yuen March 2012 - Middle of Chinatown with all that good kitchie souvenir stuff close by. Good street foodmarket at night outside the hotel. MRT Chinatown station is 50 metres away. During the day, local bakeries and restaurants provide meals and drinks. Stayed twice at this hotel on 12 hour flight stopovers. The rooms are very small, dark and doesnt have windows; bathrooms can be awkward to shower. Lighting does not allow you to read. It is clean and efficient. Good bed and shower excellent pillows. Free Wi Fi Large for the room air conditioner's output was directed onto the bed. Room was extremely small.. Was quoted $254.88 for two nights got charged $300. The bed was walled in on tree sides. I will have a good look around to see what else is available at the price at the next visit Prepare for windowless, small, dimly lit cubicle, and you will be able to sleep, bath, surf free internet and watch TV. Location wise is excellent, in artificial Chinatown a la Singapore, just off from the market strip. The building is converted from a Chinese opera, so expect to see dark atrium lobby with oriental theme, like red blood color and complete with Chinese lanterns. Some people might think the design is unique, but otherwise could be scary for kids. The nicest think is its free internet, although sometimes the connection turns quite slow. If you're into value, this hotel is worth your penny considering its convenient location. When you check in, go look for Mr Ho. He maybe the best bellman I've ever met in all my travels: he knows me by name and would ask me how was my day, in this other-than-not, very 'cold' hotel. The price is good for value given the room sizes and amenities. The location is wonderful, but could be really noisy at night (they had construction for two nights, and you can't sleep with the sawing, etc). The location says everything. Right in the middle of Chinatown. It is a busy area, street noise and lots of people until late. Great restaurants, and several traditional food courts. A couple of minutes walk from the Chinatown MRT station. The hotel is fresh, clean and friendly. Everything works. The rooms are compact but very comfortable, good quiet AC, flat screen TV, safe, and excellent wifi included. The room had glass French doors and shutters opening towards the street, nice in the evening to get some fresh air. The floors are polished wood, no carpet! The Chinese decoration is tasteful, red and black throughout. The entrance and lobby area are red, with an atrium ceiling of natural timber 3 stories high, with skylights for natural light. Stunning and different. I will stay here again. I found this hotel to be an excellent value in an expensive city. I stayed in a single room without a window. Yes, the room was very small. It was basically a bed with a tiny desk. I put my bag on the chair and still had ample space but I do pack light. The bathroom was very modern but the shower does get water all over the floor. The room had a flat screen TV in the bed ""chamber"" -- lots of English stations. The a/c was great -- I had just spent a week in Thailand and compared with there, this room was like a freezer. The bed was rather hard, but this is typical of Asia. And the free wifi worked very well. I found the staff to be very helpful on check-in, and the bellman took me up to my room and explained the amenities. There is free tea down the hall. And the location couldn't be better. Less than a 5 minute walk from the Chinatown MRT station. The Santa Grand Hotel Lai Chun Yuen could get two types of reviews. It is a cool little hotel in the middle of Chinatown, with fantastic prices in overpriced Singapore. Or, the hotelâs rooms are shoeboxes, barely bigger than my walk-in closet at home. Both descriptions are correct. The hotel is located off Pagoda Street, right in the center of Chinatown, a short distance from the subway station, financial district, etc. Red is the predominant color â practically the only color all the way to your room, in what is a former Chinese opera house. The rooms are basically a bed and the space to stand up next to the bed. I was upgraded to the double, from a single, and I hate to imagine the size of the single. So know that â if you need space, donât stay here. If you read the other reviews, you are forewarned. But if you are ok in a small but well-appointed, modern room, with a surprisingly roomy bathroom, given the size of the room itself, you will like this place. My bed was comfortable, the A/C was blasting but the down duvet and pillows were wonderful. Everything very clean and new. Wi-fi works well â I am writing while in my room, downloading a movie or two. They have BBC on the TV. What more could I ask for. And did I mention I only paid 65 dollars for the place, including taxes. Clean, cool, central, at that price, is hard to beat. the website attracted our attention but the hotel did not reflect this. the staff seemed uninterested and lazy. the room was down a narrow red corridor, dodgy escalator and another narrow red corridor. at the end of it was a astronaut size pod for a room. it was not big enough for us to open our bags properly, the shower was above the toilet and flooded the bathroom. there were no windows and the bed was an after thought. and this was the superior double room at Â£90 per night! a hostel at hotel prices, look elsewhere X'mas 2011.. This hotel have a best location,near by MRT(if walking to MRT,just 5 minute) and near by Chinatown-street.It very clean,the staff very friendly and have a good service,But the lobby decoration very red and the style like old Chinese traditional...i dont like the decoration because the feel like stay in ""Ghost House""!!!!The room very small but very clean,i have walk in to other hotel in Chinatown but the room also very small like this!!! It just a simple room,have bathroom,towl,floor towel,toilet accessories(toothbrush,toothpaste,shower cap and other) ,my room is Superior Double Bed room,it have a twin bed,a small dest,small cabinet(for cloth use),safety box and other...",,,

Brand new hotel, location and the setting are very nice, very close to Aksaray station so not a problem to explore the city. We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. In fact, we are lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to deluxe room by the manager, Mr Mehmet & let us to check in very early after an early arrival with no extra charge. The rooms were great, decorated with very good taste & luxury!! I cannot forget the softness of that bed. Bathroom had separate shower and tub. Free wifi. Unfortunately we did not try the hotel spa. All in all we really enjoyed our stay, this hotel is highly recommended, and would not hesitate to stay here again. All staffs are friendly & helpful people. Clean, fresh and modern .Very close to tram station, the room was well decorated The hotel facility was overall great. The staff's attitude was not professional except Mr Morchay and the personal who served the breakfast. Mr MehmedÃ¢â¬â¢s attitude was worst.We had 4 rooms , 2 of them were small and dark,and when I asked him nicely if we could change one of them he replied in an unpleasent manner that itÃ¢â¬â¢s the matter of money and if one pay less canÃ¢â¬â¢t expect better!We paid 120 US dollar for one standard room! Now when I check online I see that with almost that amount of money we could have a Royal suit or family room (1680kr/night)for 2 couples if we had been given better information! The other exampel was when I asked him for a secound key.We got just one key when we arrived and the other day, my housband was out and when I asked him for another one,he gave it to me under condition that I have to pay if I loose it ,again in an unfriendly manner! We stayed in this hotel for three nights. Our first impression was of the friendly helpful staff. We arrived early , 10am and they were only too happy to allow us into the room. The room was very compact to say the least but clean with a comfortable bed. We had to leave early for a day tour and they offered to pack us a light breakfast to take with us. The wifi was very reliable. It was within walking distance to a lot of attractions ( a good walk) but the tram was also close if you prefer. in all a good experience but not for an extended stay. This is a 4 star luxury hotel and is brand new. The staff are well trained and the hotel is certainly very comfortable. Quality furniture and materials too. Very comfortable beds and Wifi reliable. Nice location in the old city and next to Aksaray tram stop so there is easy access to all over Istanbul. Quick check in-out, complimentary coffee, tea in room. I stayed there 4 nights and actually booked for my sister - I will definitely stay there on my next planned trip. The hotel is very elegant and the staff are very friendly, the rooms were clean and the airconditioning is perfect. We also had an upgrade from a standard to a deluxe room free of charge, that was very nice from the hotel! Thank you.",,,
sfromd,84320,"without a doubt one of the best hotels I have ever sayed at. Great location, great restaurant, great bar, great customer service and hospitality. Excellent rooms, clean and comfortable beds. I cant say enough about this hotel. It is a great place to stay. I stayed here on a business trip 3/15/12 I awoke the next morning to ROACHES on the ceiling and desks. This hotel was deplorable. The worst I have ever stayed at. Thank God my wife and kids were not with me. They also stated a mysterious 2% tax would be added on which was unpublished and coulldnt be explained. Please avoid this hotel. It was like the crack infested drug hotels you would see on a movie. without a doubt one of the best hotels I have ever sayed at.

It was like the crack infested drug hotels you would see on a movie. The bathroom had alot of hair on floor,towels were dirty we had to go to the front desk and ask for new ones,we found a toothbrush by the bed,you can hear other people from other rooms and beds smelled funky,breakfast sucked too,for $110 is was not worth it. This comfort inn has lower standard than others. Too noisy, room is small, pillow is old. Free Wifi but didn't work. I cannot access to any website. We feel that its neighborhood is not safe for women to walk at night. Luckily, we stayed only 1 night. We chose to stay in this hotel as we had some work at downtown and its proximity to subway station. While searching for hotels, I found that it is difficult to find a decent hotel in that area without paying $$$. I found this Comfort Inn to my surprise to be clean, well maintained and decent interiors. The breakfast was pretty good with some varieties and better than other motels of similar category. The rooms were small compared to Arizona standard but come on! this is downtown LA. I guarantee that other hotels in that area will be no better.Overall, agreeing to the fact that this is no resort destination, I will recommend this hotel. This hotel perfectly served the purpose of its location and provides the facilities expected from a two star motel. Clean and nice room. The beds were comfortable. Ask for a quiet room at the back of the hotel. There is no noise. Breakfast is not that bad (=> comfort inn standards). The location is a bit frightening but only at night ;-) There is a subway/metro station just 10 minutes walk away. This is a good overnight hotel for turists. Book in advance and get great deals ! Also known as Comfort Inn City Center, the West 7th location of Comfort Inn in Los Angeles isn't half-bad. There were, though, a couple of things worth noting. First off, the room and hotel were rather clean. I've stayed in some pretty bad hotels in the Los Angeles area (which you might notice if you read my other reviews) and this really was one of the better ones I've stayed in. It was also relatively quiet and the service staff was kind and helpful. Example: Right during check-in, I brushes the sleeve of my dress shirt against some wet paint that wasn't well marked. I immediately notified the gal at the front desk. She took my shirt, cleaned it, ironed it, and had it back to me within 20 minutes. I was impressed. As for the bad, the free WiFi did not work for much of the trip. This is extremely frustrating when you're on a business trip and have work to do. The door to our room was extremely difficult to open, making a loud noise whenever it was opened or closed. The room itself, while clean, was small and very cramped with two queens in it. Waffles were advertised as part of the free breakfast, yet they were nowhere to be found. I have made several recent visits to downtown LA for meetings and was looking for a decent place at a reasonable price. This Comfort Inn fills the bill nicely. The building is not new but there are signs that it is pretty well maintained and one of the rooms I had appeared to have been recently refurbished. I requested the 2nd or 3rd floor which seemed a little quieter. I found the staff to be very pleasant and accommodating and was particularly pleased with the way the room was cleaned. The free Wi-Fi had good signal strength in my room on some days, but not others. However, connecting in the lobby area was never a problem. The included breakfast was the expected juice, cereal, muffins, bagels etc. plus a waffle maker that was a nice extra. The breakfast room is fairly small and can get crowded, so I usually ate soon after they opened at 6:30AM. The neighborhood may put off a lot of people and you probably will not want to take a late evening stroll, but my wife and I walked to several nearby restaurants and had no problems or concerns. In fact during the afternoon the shops have a street market atmosphere, much like those we have seen overseas. A couple of restaurants we liked were Langer's Deli (Corner of 7th and Alvarado) that is open for breakfast and lunch only. They are fairly expensive but the food was good. Heading east on 7th about the same distance you can find a Little Cesar's Carry Out Pizza and to its left a delightful bakery and cafe (La Dolce Vita-1551 W 7th). La Dolce Vita serves salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes in addition to espresso and other specialty drinks and became our favorite spot for dinner. If you want to stay in downtown LA at a reasonable price, this Comfort Inn is certainly worth considering. The rooms were so cramped in with two beds instead of what they were built for (1) that you really have to do some fancy feet work to move around! Our window would not shut, so we called the front desk. They did not have a mantenance person on duty, so the front desk girl tried to figure it out. Needless to say, we were told we would have to wait until the next day, so we just dealt with it. The bedspreads had big stains on them, and the carpet needed a good cleaning. The breakfast room was so small you could not move around, let alone find a place to sit! Beware, they charge you per day to park your car in an uncovered parking lot! I travel a lot. Like every two weeks. First of all, the staff was top notch. They worked with what they had. My first room had brown on the sheets - a ripped shower curtain, the AC didn't work and I was totally grossed out. I was switched to a better clean room and am happy in this room. The neighborhood does not feel safe. All vending machines were out of beverages and when I went to the desk they said there was no water. NO WATER! IN THE WHOLE PLACE!! The staff member was kind enough to give me one out of her personal supply. Breakfast was not bad. Again, get these receptionists out of this terrible hotel and put them where they belong - at a top notch hotel. It's such a waste that such lovely, kind people have so little to work with. It's like a top chef being given an onion and an edd and told to make a masterpiece. Comfort Inn was good for the price $62/night. It is close to Convention Center where I attended one day. The neighborhood isn't great but parking seems secure. Rooms are small but well appointed and my bed was very comfortable. There's an adequate continental breakfast downstairs. Also, they have a nice warm pool to relax. Main complaint is internet access. Unfortunately, only place to get wifi is in lounge. But if you need a place to stay that is close to downtown but not $150 a night, this would most likely be the place to be. Arrived to this hotel not knowing it was located in a bad part of LA, and the worst part was that the doors on the outside would not fully shut or lock, anyone can have access to all halls and the elevator, very unsafe. Then the room keys would never work, we had to get new keys made at least once every day. The room was horrible. The tv's color was completely messed up, the bed had a large brown stain on it, shower was dirty, lockbox broken, parking lot was full every night with no room to park, Wi-fi connection was horrible and slow. This Comfort Inn provided no comfort My husband and I were pleasently surprised with the hotel. Parking per night was very cheap, the staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly. Our room was as it was on the internet, roomy clean and the balcony was large. Housekeeping made sure the room was completely stocked and cleaned every day. The free wifi was very good and most impressed with the breakfast spread every day. Juice coffee, pastries, toast, waffles, fresh fruit etc. The neighbourhood was not great though, didn't feel safe walking around. McDonalds, Starbucks and other convenience stores were close by. Overall I would stay here again, close to downtown it was at $7 cab ride to the staples center, really close to main attractions. The thing that was most important was the cleanliness of the room, and it was great!!!",,,
bangorgooner,576374,we went for a quick week over the half term period and were very surprised at the rooms we had een told it was a bit dated. We found the room excellant good fridge clean and comfortable the pool was small but adequate as the hotel was quiet. the food in the restaraunt was good although we only had lunch a few days the price was good also. the location was very close to the new train station at al karama which was easy for travel to malls etc. An enjoyable stay if you on a budget We arrived after along drive from Atlanta and were tired. We looked like we were in the wrong side of town and were impressed by the electric gates. We took a room which was ok and functional the breakfast was dire but the staff allowed us to leave the car there while we went to graceland a saving of $10 which was appreciated. Not a great hotel but it was ok,"We arrived after along drive from Atlanta and were tired. We looked like we were in the wrong side of town and were impressed by the electric gates. We took a room which was ok and functional the breakfast was dire but the staff allowed us to leave the car there while we went to graceland a saving of $10 which was appreciated. Not a great hotel but it was ok For the area, this is an ok hotel. The rooms were very large though old and in need of work, i.e. paint and remodeling. Hotel was dog friendly, though they charge by the day and it seems a bit expensive if you stay for more than one day. Graceland is a couple of blocks away. BUT, this is not the nicest part of Memphis, though the hotel certainly seems secure. A few blocks north, on Brooks, not nice at all. Staff was friendly and its an ok stay if you are going to Graceland and that's why you are there. Stayed here for 1 night - we arrived 1 day earlier than planned in Memphis (booked Days Inn for the following night) so found this Scottish Inn on Elvis Presley Blvd - it looked okay from the outside and had rooms available so thought we'd give it a go... First impressions were terrible - went in to reception and was basically ignored for 5 or 6 minutes, despite ringing the bell for attention. The staff were in a room right around the corner from the reception so must have known that customers were waiting. When the receptionist finally appeared we had no apology - in fact she was quite dismissive and rude to us - a very ""matter of fact"" tone and didn't volunteer any information about the room. A very, very poor reception and this set the scene for this hotel for our stay. The room itself was large and adequate - nothing special for the high rate we were charged though. My advice - stay at Days Inn down the road - see my review - staff much, much nicer and right next to Graceland. Upon arrival to Scottish Inn the owner explained that she had one room left. After a long drive from Texas my friend and I decided to take it. We were given a smoking room without warning (IÃ¢â¬â¢m allergic to smoke) but because it was already midnight I thought I would try to suck it up by leaving the windows open. I inspected the bed for bud bugs. Good news was I did not find any bed bugs; however, the sheets appeared used and hair was all over the sheets, pillows and mattress cover. The pillows were covered in stains and had a disgusting stench. The bathroom had a strong odor of urine and hair on the floor and in the tub. At that point, we decided ask for a refund. The owner charged us $10.00 because she had to pay somebody to remake the bed. I would rather sleep on the sidewalk than stay at this place. If I could give this hotel a rating of zero I would. Stay far away from the Scottish Inn!",,,
Ruta K,583505,"it`s not a hotel, it`s - a hole. I mean everything: rooms, staff, service. it`s not a hotel, it`s - a hole. I mean everything: rooms, staff, service.","it`s not a hotel, it`s - a hole. I mean everything: rooms, staff, service. I stayed in a sort of shed at the back, hole in the wall filled with expanding foam, old fridge as a bed side table. OK breakfast was included but do the staff need to brush their hair in the kitchen area. The view over the commercial back yard wasn't great I stayed here at the end of August 2011, along with my boyfriend. First impressions on arrival were not exactly great, it looks run down from the outside with what appears to be a shed attached to the hotel for a reception. On getting in to our room we were concerned by the wires hanging out the walls, the shower head which was taped on, the damp patches on the walls. So not wanting to spend any more time than was necessary in the hotel we went out pretty early. On arriving back to the hotel we went to bed, sleep for about an hour and were woken with a loud bang. Then we felt water dripping on us. We turned on the light and the light was buzzing and had filled up with water which had came through the roof and was now dripping on to our bed. We went to reception to inform them, the male at the desk did not seem bothered or shocked and just threw another room key at us! This room was no better other than the fact the roof wasnt leaking. I could go on and on but I think you get the picture.........Please save yourself the hastle and dont stay here, they dont deserve your money!!!! The hotel was ok I suppose. I went with a friend to stay there for the Scotland v Brazil game. The rooms were not in a great state with holes in the walls and a cockroach in one of the rooms. Beds were ok and my shower was ok but my friends was pretty grim looking. Close enough to walk to the Emirates within half an hour and plenty of pubs on the walk there. Overall we didnt pay a lot at all ÃÂ£90 for two rooms for two nights and we got what we paid for, The staff at this hotel were less than hospitable, I know it was supposed to be cheap and cheerful but the decor of the hotel was very poor and the toilet in our room did not have a seat. We were locked into the building and had to wait for staff to let us out. The breakfast was very basic but at least it was hot and the coffee was good. The parking which is listed as an advantage is a space on the pavement outside the hotel but it is watched by security cameras. No greetings, demanded payment for room straight away and was given a key at the same time as he was playing games on the company computer. When i did find my room, it took me 10 minutes to put the key in the door and open it. Inside the room all the carpets was stained, the kiddies wardrobe door was hanging off, so there was no where to hang my clothes. THE EN SUIT!!...woke a joke that was, it was stinking, smelly and VERY dirty. When i had a shower all the water went on to the floor and the toilet lid would not stay up!!!!!!!! I think this place should be blown up and will never stay there again or recommend this place to anyone!!! Well what can I say about the Shelton Hotel? The location is hard to find for starters. When we arrived the 24 hour reception (glorified shed next to most repulsive looking hotel I've ever seen) the man refused to check us in despite having all of the booking information printed to show him. He would not check his bookings and asserted that it had been cancelled (strangely I received no email or phone call cancelling my booking). The hotel was unlocked so a friend of mine ventured inside to find a manager. Upon which the receptionist locked her into the hotel and pushed another of my friends aside to do so. After we called the police (who were rather unhelpful) the thug that seems to pass as a receptionist in the Shelton's eyes removed the bookings list from his folder and rewrote it presumably to erase any evidence of our booking! Had to phone a cab as is a dangerous part of Islington and ended up paying almost ÃÂ£200 to get home. I would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone, it was dreadful. The night porter/receptionist/psychopath was rude, aggressive and nasty. The hotel looked hideous and they were happy to leave 5 women stranded late on a Saturday in a rough area. We are considering our legal options at the moment. carpet all stained, 2 people on computer all night, mattress stained blood and urine, fan on when toilet being used constantly, people banging on door all night into early morning, Janet said i was too late for breakfast at 10am, eventually gave me sausage beans and jam on one plate, 1st time I've ever had jammy beans, no tea, bad attitude. Theresa the nicest there. I had to fill in holes in room with poly bags as space for rats to come in, empty condom packet in room also. was in 3 different rooms, all complete nightmare, no peace all night. never recommend to anyone, the worst place in my life. Our room was very dirty. I've never seen more dirtier place to stay. The carpet was covered with ashes and cigarette, the bathroom was so dirty and never ever cleaned that I was afraid to touch something in it. The mattress on bed was covered with some plastic cover under bed-sheet so it rustling all night long. Break fast - terrible too. See photos and captions.",,,
icarolyap,2439500,"In Hong Kong, for HKD900 a night in Jan & Feb (peak season),you want get a room with FREE WIFI and spacious in Good location is not easy.I used to stay in Eaton Hotel,just opposite to it,the price is double than this hotel.This hotel is very classic design.All the basic things are in the room.Bonus:DVD Player and Heater! I used to spend few thousand to buy the Internet service in other hotel in Hong Kong, so when I know that it was a FREE WIFI hotel, I feel very lucky! I stayed in the highest floor, there is a balcony with table and chair outside the room too ! The room is quiet and clean. Very small room without working desk, I need to work with my laptop on the bed but FREE internet (Most of the hotels in HK dont give Free Internet)and local call.For price HKD400++ per night,don't expect much for the room.You have to carry the luggage to the room by yourself.Near to tram,easy to get taxi and buses.Many nice local food restaurant along the street .Not near to MTR.Must try the restaurant of the hotel,food is delicious.If you want to experience local living style in Hong Kong,this is a place near neighborhood.Not recommended for family with kids because room with not much space.Everything is small in the room,its about 120sqft. Just nice for SGD138nett (booking.com) . Clean and comfort hotel. I paid SGD138nett and get a room which is very small and noisy with no view at all.The only thing I satisfied is walking distance to Clark Quay MRT Station and famous pub along the riverside.If you can pay a little bit more, try to stay at other hotel which is more spacious.","The hotel has a very good location: on 4 minutes walking distance to Clark Quay MRT, which is very centrally. Also China town is close to the hotel. The street is quite and there is a 7eleven shop next door. The family room (for 3 adults) was clean, new, but small. The room had a window, contrary some of the other comments. The shower was not separate of the rest of the bathroom, so the all bathroom gets wet when talking a shower. Internet is on extra charge, breakfast was not included. We enjoyed our 1 night stay in the hotel and recommend this hotel. Our stay here was very pleasant. Staffs were so helpful and they offer us a lot of help during our stay. Rooms are small but all their rooms are designed that way so what more can we ask. It is new and they are keeping it very well. The breakfast is plated and not so much options to choose. They even offer huge umbrella if its raining which is very seldom to see in a hotel. Location is good coz its near Clark Quay Central Mall and you could just walk all the way up to the famous China Town and tons of stuffs you can buy from there. Have to pay the internet but its not expensive and they are super fast. Easy access going to Sentosa. Booked at half price through agoda to a good hotel in Clark Quay. The hotel is revamped cant complain as Singapore can be above budget. The shower set up is a little bazarre but go with the flow. Great location, MRT (best transport system i have ever seen) Major shopping centre and night life. I loved the hotel and Singapore There is not even a small ramp to pull your wheeled suitcase up the steps.. The standard room is so small, there is no window, the mouldy ceiling is dreadful to look at, and the washroom and toilet has a common wet floor !! And there is no exhaust fan, so after a shower, the wall mirror is totally useless ! What a throwback to the good image Singapore has always enjoyed in my mind.Goodbye...you are anything but fragrant... It is what it is. A budget hotel. On the plus side, it's new and clean. Most people here have commented on the room sizes and they are not wrong. TINY. I have never seen anything like it before. The bed is smaller as well to accommodate for the fact that a normal bed couldn't physically fit into these rooms. The beds have rubber mattresses as well, which is hideous. Why?? The location is very good. Right next to Clarke Quay and near bars / restaurants and transport. It's not too bad if you don't plan spending much time in the room. Make sure you get a good rate though. Singapore is an obscenely expensive place and rooms like this fetch a much higher price than they would almost anywhere else I've ever been! Give it a go, but bear the above points in mind if you do. Friendly front desk staff. We stay on Jan'12, brand new opened. Clean and tidy rooms. You will have a habit here in Singapore for small size of rooms and baths. LCD screen tv, safe and a dvd player is usable in room service. Internet is extra charge. Location is perfect. Near for all public transportation. there is a market nearby for daily drink and food supplies. Take 15 minutes time in advance before to order taxi. Enjoy your stay. The location was fine. Wallking distance from Clark Quay and ten minutes away from Chinatown. The hotel was clean and the staff were brisk due to the high turnover of guests. The room was a Superior and was tiny. It featured two single beds and a shower. The reduced rate we were offered did not include breakfast but the hotel is surrounded by eateries. Overall the room was too small to recommend and it was a forgettable experience. I understand that the normal rate for such a room is 250SGD a night and at that price I would look elsewhere. I paid SGD138nett and get a room which is very small and noisy with no view at all.The only thing I satisfied is walking distance to Clark Quay MRT Station and famous pub along the riverside.If you can pay a little bit more, try to stay at other hotel which is more spacious.",,,

Great Job all !!!!!","I was booking this hotel over the phone asking for a lot of information about places I could visit, restaurants I could go to and such. Christine at front desk was extremely patient and friendly with me and gave me all the information and suggested some places I could visit while in San Diego. The room was nice and clean and I do love the kitchen in the room. Will definitely come back. Just wanted to say Thank you to Christine and all the personnel (sorry I forgot names) I have met in there. I will definitely stay in your hotel again and will suggest it to friends and family. I just wanted to write a quick note about my stay. Everyone there made me feel very comfortable. If every I had a question our a problem, they were always ready to solve it and won't blow you you off until it was taken care of. The staff day or night were always polite and professional. I would recomend the san Diego location to any body. NOW MY NEXT REVIEW. I am now working in Santa Barbara where your SD staff tried to hook me up with your extended stay here. I spoke with Lindsey who gave me a deal on a room,but only until June 1. I told here we would need at least 4 rooms maybe more. She told me 2 differnt times she would speak to her up above on the June 1 rate increase problem. NO CALL BACK. So feeling like I could be out searching in June for a place to stay for 6 months, I decided to buy an RV. Now I stay at an RV Resort,where my cost will not increase. THANK YOU LINDSEY ! If your other places where all like SD I think you would be better off. Maybe use the staff at that location to be a training center on how to treat your clients and prospective clients. My work is using this hotel for a few employees for 7 weeks. I have noticed people stay for a long time, which is good and the fact they are gone all day too. They have done a lot of remodeling and everything is new. The TV is great! The hotel is quiet and very clean. The staff are all very helpful and professional. Great location and not too far from downtown. I highly recommend Homestead. This hotel was chosen for us by my husbands work. We have stayed now for 4 weeks, 3 more weeks to go. I was very pleased how the hotel is after reading some reviews. The hotel is newly remodeled, some rooms have granite countertops. It is clean, new paint, new carpet, new toilets, new floor in kitchen and bathroom, new flat screen tv's, free internet :), free parking, free breakfast goodies and great customer service from all staff. We often need to check-in early, with no problem. We have stayed in a queen room and a king room. I highly recommend the extra $5 to $10 a night to stay in the king room; the room is much bigger and the bed is bigger and more comfortable:) They have an on-site laundry room which is always open and cheaper than the laundrymats in town. Every unit has a full size fridge and a few eating and cooking utensils & flatware. Save your money on the more expensive hotels and save it for the great restaurants in town :) Staying in homestead was a good experience. I had stayed there for about 1 week. It is very near to Qualcom office. Christina and cheyne at front desk were very helpful. I really enjoyed staying at the homestead because first of all it's a quiet place and second the staff is very helpful and responds to your requests promptly. They kept probing if I'm happy with the service. RIght there, that's definitely an impeccable service. Keep up the good job folks! Dany M. This hotel definitely fit the bill with what I needed. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were all recently renovated with a very nice, modern look, and the place honestly felt like a home away from home. If any issues arose, management got on them right away to make sure they were taken care of immediately. The kitchen is another good feature, helping the room feel like home while also controlling dining costs during your stay. The location is ideal too as it's situated right between the 805 and 15 freeways, with the 56 just slightly to the north - this made it really easy to get anywhere in the San Diego area. This Homestead is a great, low-key place to stay and I definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in San Diego.
